<p>Very sincere thanks for all the trouble which you have so kindly taken for me about the Turkeys: your information will be of use to me, whenever circumstances will permit me to finish my half completed volume.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Your ancient case of the woman with a hairy face is curious;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> for, as perhaps you know, there has of late occurred an instance in the Malay archipelago; &amp; the peculiarity was hereditary &amp; accompanied by peculiarities in the teeth.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Thanks for all your sympathy about us: we have been most unfortunate; Horace<ref target="#foot.f4"/> seriously ill, in a strange manner, all the Spring; &amp; then Leonard came home from school with Scarlet Fever, had recurrent fever, with serious mischief in his kidneys &amp; then bad erysipelas.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> At last we started for this place; but he suffered much from the journey &amp; at Southampton Emma had Scarlet-fever pretty sharp: we have been here for about 10 days &amp; both my patients are going on admirably, &amp; we have two Houses so that I trust the other children will escape. I have never passed so miserable a nine months.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I hope we shall all get safe home in about 3 weeks. I had thought of going to Cambridge;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> but now I feel very doubtful &amp; shall not make up my mind till the time arrives &amp; I see how I am. If I do go it will be only for 2 or 3 days. It would indeed be most pleasant to meet you there; but I never know what I can do. All this misery has shaken me a good deal; but I am righting now.— Emma sends her kind remembrances to you.</p>
<p>My dear old friend | Yours affectionly | C. Darwin</p>
<p>If you go to Cambridge please tell me.</p>
