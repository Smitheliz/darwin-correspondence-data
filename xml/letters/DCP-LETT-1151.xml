<p>As you have thought the superintendence of the Admiralty Instructions worthy of the sacrifice of your time, I cannot hesitate a moment in undertaking the Geological part.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I will do my utmost to make them worthy of your approval, though I confess that I feel great doubts how far I shall succeed. Should I fail, I hope you will get some one else to undertake the task, &amp; any part of mine which was serviceable might be worked in without my name. It is a great relief to me, that you have the superintendence of the whole, for then I shall feel safe that nothing very unwise will left in, though I assure you that I shall be very far from taking less pains on this account. Unfortunately I am at present in the midst of a difficult dissection, which if I neglect, the labour of some weeks will be almost thrown away,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> so that I fear that I cannot commence for about a week, but when I do I will do nothing else till I have finished.</p>
<p>I have already drawn up for Prof. Owen some remarks on Coral Reefs, &amp; these, I think, ought now to come into the Geological part, of which I did not know when I wrote them.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I fear my instructions will make rather a short Chapter.</p>
<p>I am extremely much obliged for your kind thought of my health, which is never now strong &amp; which prevents me from working but a very short time each day;— I mention this, as you might suppose I could draw up the instructions in the intervals of other pursuits; but this I cannot do.—</p>
<p>Will you be so good as to present my respectful &amp; kinds compliments to Lady Herschel, &amp; believe me, my dear Sir, with the most sincere respect. | Yours very faithfully | C. Darwin <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> To | Sir J. W. Herschel Bart.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Herschel had been asked to edit a proposed <hi rend="italic">Manual of scientific enquiry</hi> (Herschel ed. 1849). In a memorandum prefixed to the <hi rend="italic">Manual</hi> the lords commissioners of the Admiralty explained their belief that previous instructions for scientific observations and collections had been too voluminous and over-specialised. Their intention in providing new instructions was to enable ‘men merely of good intelligence and fair acquirement’ to produce ‘eminently useful results’. They wished to obtain ‘the assistance of some of our most eminent men of Science in the composing, by each, of a plain and concise chapter upon the head of enquiry with which he might be most conversant’ (Herschel ed. 1849, pp. iii–iv). There were fifteen contributors to the book.</note>
