<p>I am very much obliged for the capital little almanack;<ref target="#foot.f1"/> it so happened that I was wishing for one to keep in my portfolio. I had never seen this kind before &amp; shall certainly get one pro futuro. I think it is very amusing to have a list before one’s eyes, of the order of appearance of the plants &amp; animals around one: it gives a fresh interest to each fine day.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> There is one point, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to see a little improved, viz the correction for the clock at shorter intervals: most people, I suspect, who like myself, have dials, will wish to be more precise,, than with a margin of three minutes. I always buy a 1<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> almanack for this <hi rend="underline">sole</hi> end.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>By the way <hi rend="underline">your</hi> ie. V. Vorst<ref target="#foot.f4"/> almanack’s is very dear; it ought, at least, to be advertised post-free for the 1<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>.— Do you not think a table, (not rules) of conversion of French into English measures &amp; perhaps weights w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be <hi rend="doubleUnderline">exceedingly</hi> useful.—also centi-grade into Fahr.—magnifying powers according to focal distances— in fact you might make it the most useful publication of the age.—</p>
<p>I know what I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like best of all, namely current metereolog. remarks for each month, with statement of average course of winds &amp; prediction of weather in accordance with movements of the Barometer. People, I think, are always amused at knowing the extremes &amp; means of temp. for corresponding times in other years.—</p>
<p>I hope you will go on with it another year.—</p>
<p>With many thanks, my dear Jenyns. | Yours very truly | C. Darwin</p>

It was intended especially for those who interest themselves in the periodic phenomena of animals and plants, of which a select list was given under each month of the year. The Pocket Almanack contained, moreover, miscellaneous information relating to Zoology and Botany; to Natural History and other scientific societies; to public Museums and Gardens, in addition to the ordinary celestial phenomena found in most other Almanacks. It continued to be issued till 1847, after which year the publication was abandoned.</quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Robert Waring Darwin kept a record of the flowering and fruiting times of plants in his garden at The Mount in Shrewsbury. A ‘Garden book’ (private collection) contains these details and is arranged so that the family would have known, day by day, what to have expected from their garden, based on the experience of previous years.</note>
