                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I am very much obliged for your extremely kind letter &amp; for your several presents.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Although your appreciation of my work is certainly too high, yet it is very encouraging to me, especially as yesterday I read two pamphets, just published in England, in which every form of abuse is heaped on me.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am called, for instance, a “filthy dreamer”.— You seem to be doing splendid work in physiology, the noblest of sciences, as I have long thought it. What you say about the differences of the blood-crystals is truly astonishing.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am also much interested by what you say of the different effect of Prussic acid on different individuals of the same species: I remember some years ago wishing in vain for information on this head. I think it arose from observing how differently in quickness (whether due to rate of respiration or to direct action of the poison I could not tell) the vapour acted on different insects. I remember Bees died instantly, but (I think,) it was a Longicorn beetle which resisted all effects for an astonishing time.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>R. W. Darwin is my Father, but I believe he was greatly aided in his paper on optics by his Father Erasmus D.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have really nothing of interest about myself, but as you desire it, I will scribble whatever occurs to me.— I derived <hi rend="underline">no</hi> advantage from the Lectures at Edinburgh, for they were infinitely dull &amp; cured me of any taste for Geology for 3 years. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grant<ref target="#foot.f7"/> was not a Professor, but worked at zoology out of pure love, &amp; his Society was a great encouragement. I used to amuse myself with examining marine animals, but I did so solely for amusement. I believe I was the first person who ever saw the earliest locomotive egg-like state of a Bryozoon: I showed it to Grant, who stated so at the meeting of the Wernerian Nat. Hist. Soc. &amp; this little discovery was an immense encouragement.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I was disgusted at anatomy &amp; attended only 2 or 3 Lectures &amp; this has been ever since an irreparable loss to me.— When I went to Cambridge, I became a most enthusiastic collector of Coleoptera; but again only for amusement. If any one told me the name of a Beetle, I thought I knew all that anyone could desire; &amp; I believe I never ever looked even at the oral organs of any insect! Yet I worked like a slave at collecting. Henslow’s Society was a great charm &amp; benefit to me, &amp; I liked much his Lecture on Botany.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> All my early life I was mad for collecting, minerals, shells, plants, Bird-skins have all had their turn. Near the end of my Cambridge life Henslow persuaded me to begin Geology. I was always very fond of observing the habits of Birds, &amp; White’s Nat. Hist. of Selborne,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> thus had much influence on my mind. But of all books, Humboldt’s Travels had by far the greatest influence—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I read large parts over &amp; over again.— I had nearly managed to get a party to go to the Canary Isl<hi rend="superscript">ds</hi>, when the offer of joining the <hi rend="underline">Beagle</hi> was made to me &amp; joyfully accepted.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I suppose, however, no ever started worse prepared than I was except as a mere collector. I knew nothing of anatomy, &amp; had never read any systematic work on Zoology— I had never touched a compound microscope &amp; had begun Geology for only about 6 months. But I took out plenty of Books<ref target="#foot.f13"/> &amp; worked as hard as I could &amp; dissected roughly all sorts of the lower marine animals. Here I felt fearfully the want of practice &amp; knowledge. My education in fact began on board the Beagle. I remember nothing previously which deserved to be called education except some experimental work at chemistry when a school-boy with my Brother.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> No doubt collecting largely in so many branches had improved my powers of observation.—</p>
<p>I never wrote so much about myself in my life, &amp; I hope it may be worth your reading, but I doubt.—</p>
<p>Believe me, my dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>I do not know whether you will care to see extracts from my letters printed by Prof. Henslow, but I send a copy by this Post.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
