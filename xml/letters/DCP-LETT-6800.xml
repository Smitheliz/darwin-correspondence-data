            <p>Recounts the trip back from St Petersburg – visits to botanic gardens and museums throughout Western Europe.</p> 
<p>Pleased that CD admired Bentham’s address [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">6793</hi>]. JDH had read it in MS and modified some very heterodox passages about insularity. CD has hit the flaw in it.</p>

<p>A few lines just to say that we are back—as yesterday—having come round by Stockholm, Upsala, Copenhagen, Hamburgh, Hanover Utrecht, Amsterdam, Hague, Leyden &amp; Rotterdam, inspecting the Bot. Gardens &amp; their museums throughout—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I got <hi rend="underline">very</hi> tired of it—thought it was excessively interesting—but the constant packing &amp; moving got odious. Such lots of people asked for you— Even at the Hague I found a young Frenchman busy making notes on the Pictures, so I pointed out the <hi rend="underline">Dodo</hi> to him &amp; he immediately asked me whether it was alluded to in Darwins last book on Animals &amp; Plants, <hi rend="underline">which he had read</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Miquel we staid 2 days with, in his House—so nice &amp; pleasant: he has 4 very fine daughters such fine pleasant English like girls—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> two of them will visit us in September— M. is quite a convert;—he is a very intelligent man, but in poor health. Œrsted<ref target="#foot.f4"/> at Copenhagen also talked heaps about you— he too is a very able man, &amp; good naturalist.</p>
<p>We have good news of Willy, who has been up to near the scene of the late murders in a Govt. steamer with Capt. Haultaine, the Defence Minister—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Hector<ref target="#foot.f6"/> is looking out for a settlement for him— he is perfectly well &amp; of course happy— I do hope he will take to a settler’s life— I am so sure it is the only thing that can suit him for the next 5 years— Hector truly says that he is many years younger than his age— Everyone is charmed with his manner &amp; general conduct—</p>
<p>Miquel has been telling me how the Flora of Sumatra &amp; Borneo are identical, &amp; of Java quite different—just as Wallace shows for the Animals.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>How I wish I could join you in Wales, but it is impossible   I have a pile of letters that appalls <hi rend="underline">myself</hi>, &amp; I am not easily frightened—plus a large unopened box of documents &amp; pamphlets accumulated during my absence   I too sometimes wish myself in a tomb—though I hold that the balance of life is always on the side of enjoyment, &amp; that the bitterness of the bitterest loss is an insufficient measure of the enjoyment we had in the object lost.—</p>
<p>I am always rejoiced when you like Benthams addresses—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I read it all in mss, &amp; modified some very heterodox passages about Insularity &amp; its effects— you have hit—the flaw in the address— Indeed I do wish I could write another Essay on Islands,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; do not give up the hope— I think if Bentham had read Wallace’s volumes he would have been more cautious—but he had no time— he however modified extensively what he had written on the strength of what I told him—that is to say he struck out several passages &amp; put others more guardedly.—</p>
<p>Your offer to aid Andersson is a noble one:—I too have often gazed at the Cocos &amp; Revillagigedos &amp; others more isolated still—there away—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> if Andersson gets a schooner he could do all.</p>
<p>I am woefulley disappointed to hear of your health— is it the sequelle of your fall that you now suffer from?—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Now as to Beards, we never forget them &amp; began to count—in Russia, but soon gave it up, as there was no exception to the rule of the Beard Moustachies &amp; Whiskers being paler than the hair, usually ruddier also.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>The Copenhagen &amp; Stockholm Prehistoric Museums are perfectly wonderful, we have nothing at all like them for richness of material &amp; admirable instructive arrangement.— The Danish one is en suite with an Ethnographical Museum of the very highest value, extent, &amp; beauty, which is now under rearrangement, &amp; that again graduates into an illustration of Danish Arts &amp; customs, carried down to the present century. The Dutch Ethnographical &amp; Antiquities collections are very far behind hand indeed—in every respect.</p>
<p>I was charmed to find my former visit to Leyden in 1845.! well remembered by Schlegel &amp; the 2 or 3 survivors of the 10–12 naturalists I then knew there—but what an old man it made of me!<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
