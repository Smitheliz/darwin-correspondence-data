<p>I shall write my Babbiana tonight, instead of before breakfast. It is really wonderful how good &amp; quiet the children have been; sitting quite still during two or three visits conversing about everything &amp; much about you &amp; your return— When I said I shall jump for joy, when I hear the dinner bell Willy said, “I know when you will jump much more—when Mamma comes home” &amp; so shall I responded many times Annie. It is evident to me, that <hi rend="underline">you must</hi> be the cause of all the children’s fidgets &amp; naughtinesses.— Annie told me that Willie had never been <hi rend="underline">quite</hi> round the world, but that he had been a long way, beyond Leave’s Green— The Baby has neglected me much today &amp; would not play; she c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not eat any jam, because she had eat so much at tea; but not like Annie of old she did not care. She was rather fidgety, going in &amp; out of the room &amp; Brodie declares she was looking for you— I did not believe it, but when she was sitting on my knee afterward &amp; was looking eagerly at pictures, I said “where is poor Mamma” she <hi rend="underline">instantaneously</hi> pushed herself off, trotted straight to the door, &amp; then to the green door,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> saying Kitch &amp; Brodie let her through, when she trotted in, looked all round her &amp; began to cry; but some coffee-grains quite comforted her— Was not this very pretty? Willy told me to tell you that he had been very good &amp; had given Annie only one tiny knock, &amp; I was to tell you that he had pricked his finger.—</p>
<p>My own annals are of the briefest, I paced half-a dozen times along Kitchen Garden in the horrid cold wind, &amp; came in &amp; read Monsters &amp; co,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> till tired, had some visits from children, had very good dinner &amp; very good negus<ref target="#foot.f4"/> —played with children till 6 oclock read again &amp; now have nothing to do, but most heartily wish you back again.—</p>
<p>My dear old wife, take care of yourself &amp; be a good girl. C. D.— <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> Sat. Morn. All right—Willy said to me “poor Poor laying all by himself &amp; no company in the drawing room.” Farewell to our Slip of Land<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Is not poor Eliza’s letter wonderful, pray beg Harry to give some kind message from us—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
