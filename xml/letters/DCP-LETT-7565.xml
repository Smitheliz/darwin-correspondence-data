<p>Will you forgive me for troubling you with the request to be allowed to make use of some sentences in letters of yours to the late Charles Boner author of “Transylvania” “Forest creatures” and other works?<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have been occupied for many months with the arrangement of his papers and I have made a collection of Memorials of his varied and most interesting career at the request &amp; with the assistance of his daughter and sister.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Boner consulted me on literary matters and when he died no one but myself was acquainted with his wishes &amp; instructions respecting his last work— While preparing it for the press it struck me that some notice of its author might be added and so many clever men have aided &amp; contributed that my tribute to his memory has become much more important than I at first expected.</p>
<p>Among many private letters &amp; papers sent to me from Munich by Madame Horschelt and Miss Boner I find some letters of yours which contain such a true appreciation of my dear friends works and powers of observation that I would willingly if you have no objection make a few extracts from them. May I use your name as it will increase the value of your flattering comments? If you have any letters of Charles Boner’s likely to be interesting either whole or in portion to the public it would be a great favour to me and to his daughter if you would lend them to me. I will promise to return them if you wish it and you may rely on my discretion not to publish any passage which could in any respect be objectionable.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I must add that all I do in this matter is out of respect for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Boner’s talents and affection for his memory as I shall derive no pecuniary benefits from the work. For the accuracy of what I have now said as I am a perfect stranger to you I can refer you to M<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>. Horschelt, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Boner’s daughter, who resides at 5 Louisa Strasse Munich. She has entrusted me with all her father’s most private papers &amp; letters and relies on me implicitly.</p>
<p>Believe me to remain | with much respect | yours very faithfully | Rosa Mackenzie Kettle</p>
<p>An easier reference perhaps would be Edward Wilberforce Esq<hi rend="superscript">re</hi>.</p>
<p>4 Harcourt Buildings | Inner Temple</p>
<p>Please to address me as Miss Rosa M. Kettle</p>
<p>an early reply will oblige me as I am preparing the proof sheets for publication by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bentley<ref target="#foot.f5"/> after Easter</p>
