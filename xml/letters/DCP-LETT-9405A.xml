<p>Finding that the leaves of <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> digest <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the phosphate of lime out of bones and then remain clasped over the bones for a long time, CD wants to determine whether it is the phosphate of lime or the animal matter in the bones that keeps them clasped. He asks EF to send 2 or 3 grams of pure phosphate of lime for his testing. [See <hi rend="doubleUnderline">9411</hi>.] Will experiment in the summer using EF’s suggestion that leaves might serve to test weak sewage. Results of Sanderson’s experiments with acids of great use.</p>

<p>I have just found out that the leaves of Drosera can digest <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the phosphate of lime out of bones, &amp; they remain clasped over them for an unusual length of time. Now I want much to ascertain whether it is the phosphate of lime or the animal matter in the bones which keeps them so long clasped. Could you therefore be so kind as to give me 2 or 3 grains of pure phosphate of lime with no animal matter or excess of acid. I believe I am right in supposing that it is phosphate and not super-phosphate in bone.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have been much delayed in my work on drosera by new editions of other books,—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; therefore I shall have time &amp; am very anxious to try an experiment suggested by you, namely whether the leaves would serve to test very weak sewage water.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Somewhat later in the summer I will beg you to aid me in procuring a little of what may be considered weak sewage water, as I am quite ignorant what would be considered weak &amp; how to obtain it. From your former kindness I think that you will excuse my troubling you.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S | The acids which you were so kind as to send to Burdon-Sanderson have proved of the <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi> use to me, as he finds that all of them with pepsin digest animal matter.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
