<p>I am very much obliged for your “Notes on the Fertilization of Orchids”, received a fortnight ago, and for your kind notice of my observations in the paper.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have examined several fresh Ophryds since my return hither,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but have not observed any contrivance that seems to require special notice.</p>
<p>What an extraordinary and unique device you notice in <hi rend="underline">Coryanthes</hi>!<ref target="#foot.f3"/> There really seems to be no limit to Nature’s versatility: it is impossible to conjecture anything too unusual or unlikely for her to accomplish. Every organism seems to be perpetually on the <hi rend="underline">qui vive</hi> for the slightest chance of bettering its position, and it is difficult to separate the fact of this constant fitness and aptitude for making the utmost of opportunities from the idea of conscious and deliberate intent and action. One certainly cannot say at what point in the scale intellectual action or purpose absolutely ceases.</p>
<p>I have not forgotten your query about Baboons; but no person that I have spoken to on the subject can say from observation that males fight for possession of females, though at the same time I notice that no one seems to think such a proceeding at all unlikely.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Mention of sexes reminds me that I made a note for you respecting the assembling of many ♂s of <hi rend="underline">Sphinx Convolvuli</hi> about a single ♀.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Unfortunately, I cannot lay my hand on it, so as to refer to the work in which I noticed the case, but I am quite sure of the fact’s being on record, and that it was observed in some part of England.</p>
<p>Among Moths whose underside of the wings exceed the upperside in beauty of marking and colouring, I find the South-American <hi rend="underline">Geometræ</hi> belonging to the genus <hi rend="underline">Erateina</hi> of E. Doubleday. Of those figured (in Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., New Series, vol. V, pl. XV &amp; XVI), the more striking in this respect are <hi rend="underline">E. Regina</hi>, E. <hi rend="underline">Margarita</hi>, and <hi rend="underline">E. obscura.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f6"/> In all these the upper surface is brownish or fuscous with a few white markings, while the under surface is elaborately varied with white, red, &amp; chestnut-red, and in <hi rend="underline">E. Regina</hi> with yellow also.</p>
<p>About a year ago, I witnessed and made a note of a case of sexual selection in a Moth, <hi rend="underline">Syntomis cerbera</hi>. The ♀ in this instance had but recently emerged from the puparium, for her wings (she was clinging to the underside of a leaf of a tall grass) were still limp and hanging downward. When I first noticed her, she was closely beset by four ♂s. One of these flew off as I approached, but the remaining three persisted in their endeavours, clustering about in constant motion, and holding on by the ♀’s back and wings. I watched them closely; and though each ♂ repeatedly contrived to clasp the extremity of the ♀’s abdomen with his own, and the ♀ remained perfectly motionless, no junction was effected. After I had watched the group for about 5 or 6 minutes, one ♂ appeared to consider it a hopeless case, for he suddenly flew off. Shortly afterwards, another ♂ also departed rather abruptly. The ♂ that remained persisted for some little time in his efforts, and at length the obdurate ♀ yielded; but the union was incomplete, for, in attempting to assume the ordinary position in line with the ♀ on the narrow grass-leaf, the ♂’s struggles occasioned a separation.</p>
<p>A second union, however, immediately followed, the usual position was safely taken up, and the ♀ for the first time moved her wings into their ordinary place on each side of the body. I compared this successful suitor with many other ♂s taken in the same field on the same day, and am bound to say that there was nothing in his size or colouring to entitle him to preference; but, of course, I don’t presume to compare my poor <hi rend="underline">ocelli</hi> with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. <hi rend="underline">Cerbera’s</hi> argus eyes, and there can be little doubt that she found attractions in him to which his disappointed rivals could lay no claim.</p>
<p>I may mention that there was a great number of these Moths in the field; I counted 24 pairs <hi rend="underline">in copulâ</hi> on the grass stems, in addition to very many individuals. The Genus <hi rend="underline">Syntomis</hi> is one of the family <hi rend="underline">Zygænidæ</hi>, to which our English “Burnet Moths” also belong.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I am sorry to say that I have less time than ever for Nat. History. A cry for what is called “Retrenchment” is now prevalent, and reductions are being made in the Civil Service, the effect of which in our Office is to give me much more work without the consolation of additional pay!<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Alas that the Age of Sinecures is well-nigh passed away! In <hi rend="underline">my</hi> opinion, Government ought to provide appointments with little work and decent emoluments expressly for naturalists; but it is surprising how few of the people I meet share in this view!!</p>
<p>Hoping that your health has improved, and with kindest regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin and your family, I remain | Very faithfully yours, | Roland Trimen.</p>
