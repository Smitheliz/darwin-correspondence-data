            <p>Thanks CD for the reference to Audubon’s story. T. M. Brewer is to be trusted, but his account does not suggest why the bird always moved northward.</p>

<p>I am indeed exceedingly grateful to you for your prompt attention to my request &amp; for furnishing me with the references to Audubon’s story—which is as good for its purpose in regard to a Night-Heron as the Goose—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Dr. Brewer, whose personal acquaintance I made nearly 25 years ago, was, I believe, a perfectly honest man, &amp; his statement fully deserves acceptance.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Having got your letter before going to the Museum this afternoon I looked up the story as soon as I was there. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Brewer unfortunately does not seem to say whether there was anything in the configuration of the locality which would tempt the bird always to move in a northerly direction. It may have been that the only exit practicable was by that way, in which case the bird would naturally have taken it. When one tries to ascribe or explain motives to actions one is very often in the wrong, and I suspect one is still more likely to err in regard to the lower animals concerning whose impulses we know so much less. It seems to me that we are always in danger of misinterpreting the object (if there is one) of their actions, and except in a very limited number of cases can never feel sure about it.</p>
<p>This, however, I doubt not you have duly considered, and therefore I will say no more but that I am | Yours very truly | Alfred Newton</p>
<p>I do hope that when you come here next time, you will give me the pleasure of seeing you in my rooms</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The letter from CD to Newton has not been found; Newton’s request was probably made in person when CD was in Cambridge from 20 to 27 October 1881 (CD’s ‘Journal’ (Appendix II)). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_187.xml">John James Audubon</ref>’s story about the night-heron, as told to him by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_614.xml">Thomas Mayo Brewer</ref>, is reported in <hi rend="italic">Ornithological biography</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_249.xml">Audubon 1831–[9]</ref>, 5: 600–2. Brewer had reported that his tame bird, who could not fly, attempted to migrate in the autumn, but always went in a northerly direction. Brewer concluded that experience as well as instinct was required to determine the proper route. The night-heron was <hi rend="italic">Ardea nycticorax</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">N. nycticorax</hi>, the black-crowned night heron); it is a member of the family Ardeidae. Geese are members of the family Anatidae.</note>
