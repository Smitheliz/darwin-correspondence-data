<p>I want to beg one more favour to the many which formerly you have conferred on me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am extremely much interested in regard to the blind cave animals, described some time since in your Journal by Prof. Silliman Jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> as the subject is connected with a work of somewhat general nature, which I am endeavouring to draw up on variation &amp; the origin of species, classification &amp;c.—</p>
<p>Are the specimens at Newhaven? and if so could you get any good entomologist to look at the insects— What I want to know is, whether any of the Crustacea, spiders, insects (flies beetles, crickets &amp;c) &amp; Fish belong to the American type<ref target="#foot.f4"/> (Has not Agassiz noticed the Fish?)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> ie to genera or sections of genera, found only on the American continent.— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be most grateful for any, the least, information on this head.— All the American mice have a peculiar character in their teeth by which they can be recognised.—</p>
<p>Secondly I have been rereading with renewed interest your memoir on geograph. Distrib. of Crustacea<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; I want to ask a question on this head: Botanists have remarked on several cases in which northern temperate &amp; arctic genera have sent the same or representative species into corresponding zones of S. hemisphere.— You give several similar &amp; striking cases; but I do not feel sure from my ignorance that these genera can be called from their general affinities &amp; range strictly northern genera. How is this? Might they not be called southern genera, which have sent species to the North: I ask this because in plants, it is very remarkable as observed by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker &amp; A. Decandolle, that southern genera have <hi rend="underline">not</hi> their represetatives or identical species in the north, though there are so many cases of northern genera which have their congeners &amp; same individual species in the south.— Will you be so very kind as to reflect on this, &amp; take the trouble to inform me.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Lastly can you remember whether any author (I think M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eights whose writings I have never seen) has described fossil trees in the S. Shetland islands.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Now I am sure I have put your kindness to a severe proof, &amp; can only beg to be forgiven.— If you have a few minutes to spare, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. <hi rend="underline">very</hi> much like to hear a little news of yourself, &amp; whether all things go well with you. Are you at work at any particular great subject? I should expect so, though no one whatever in the world has a better right to rest on his oars than you have. I never cease being fairly astounded at the amount of labour which you have performed.— But the other day I was sitting at dinner by Prof. Miller of (our) Cambridge,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; he was speaking warmly on your mineralogical work.—</p>
<p>As for myself I live a very quiet &amp; retired life, with a large set of very happy &amp; good children round me, &amp; do daily 3 or 4 hours work at Natural History; for more than which I have not, &amp; shall never have, strength.— Our neighbour J. Lubbock, has married a young &amp; pretty wife, &amp; a very young couple they are reckoned in this country, &amp; I think &amp; hope he will be as happy as he deserves: he works away during the very little leisure which he has, at his Entomostraca, &amp; if he could give himself up to Nat. History, he would make a capital Naturalist.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Pray believe me, my dear Sir, with every good wish &amp; sincere respect. | Yours very truly | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>I have directed this to care of Prof. Silliman; as I heard some time since that you were Professor of Geology at some new place.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
