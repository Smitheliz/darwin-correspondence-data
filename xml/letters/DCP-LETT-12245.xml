            <p>Discusses CGS’s account of Pellew Islands. Still believes atolls and barrier reefs in Pacific indicate subsidence. But cases like Pellew Islands, if frequent, would make his conclusions of little value.</p>

<p>I thank you for your extremely kind letter of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, &amp; for the proof sheets. I believe that I understand all, excepting one or two sentences where my imperfect knowledge of German has interfered.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> This is my sole &amp; poor excuse for the mistake which I made in the second edit of my Coral book.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Your account of the Pellew Islands is a fine addition to our knowledge on Coral reefs. I have very little to say on the subject: even if I had formerly read your account &amp; seen your maps, but had known nothing of the proofs of recent elevation &amp; of your belief that the Islands have not since subsided, I have no doubt that I should have considered them as formed during subsidence. But I should have been much troubled in my mind by the sea not being so deep as it usually is round atolls, and by the reef on one side sloping so gradually beneath the sea; for this latter fact, as far as my memory serves me, is a very unusual &amp; almost unparalleled case. I always foresaw that a bank at the proper depth beneath the surface would give rise to a reef which could not be distinguished from an atoll formed during subsidence.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I must still adhere to my opinion that the atolls &amp; barrier-reefs in the middle of the Pacific &amp; Indian oceans indicates subsidence;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but I fully agree with you that such cases as that of the Pellew Islands if of at all frequent occurrence, would make my general conclusions of very little value. Future observers must decide between us. It will be a strange fact if there has not been subsidence of the beds, of the great oceans and if this has not affected the forms of the Coral reefs.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>In the 3 last pages of the last sheet sent, I am extremely glad to see that you are going to treat of the dispersion of animals.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Your preliminary remarks seem to me quite excellent. There is nothing about M. Wagner as I expected to find.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I suppose that you have seen Moseley last book, which contains some good observations on dispersion.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
                    <p>I am glad that your ‘Biology’ will appear in English, for then I can read it with ease.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Pray believe me | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
