                    <salute> Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
<p>I am very much obliged to you for your extraordinary kindness in having sent me the paper on climbing plants by my brother and moreover your own work on this object, from which I had only read an abridgement in the botanical journal Flora, likewise for your bountiful communications on the papers published lately on the fertilization of flowers.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The lecture of Hildebrand’s book “Geschlechtervertheilung”, sent me several days ago by Prof. Hanstein, has convinced myself that this department of observation, in which I intended to betake myself, is reaped almost as thoroughly as the fertilization of Orchids has been by your admirable work. Some few important details would possibly be found in examining in this regard our indigenous flowers, but of decisive importance would chiefly rest only the trial of breeding for several generations plants of the small always closed flowers of Lamium amplexicaule and of other similar species.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I congratulate with my brother for having so abundant an opportunity and so perfect an ableness in discovering new interesting facts of some importance for your theorie.</p>
<p>With respect to Subularia I am sorry to say that it does not grow in Westfalia.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Of Pyrola two species (minor and rotundifolia) grow near Lippstadt and I shall not neglect to look on whether one of them is dimorphic and to advertise you.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>With Lopezia at this day at first I have begun, reminded by you and by Hildebrand’s book, to mark the individual flowers in order to watch more closely the revolution of the single parts. Indoubtedly L. miniata will behave as L. coronata observed by Hildebrand.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>With my sincere thanks I remain | My dear Sir | Yours most respectfully | H Müller</p>

CD had also sent a copy of his own paper, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Climbing plants’</ref>. A summary of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Climbing plants’</ref> was published in the German journal <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi> in June 1866 (<hi rend="italic">Flora</hi> n.s. 24 (1866): 241–52). Müller had asked about recent literature on the pollination of plants by insects in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5457.xml">letter of 23 March 1867</ref>. The letter in which CD sent this information has not been found.</note>

In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, p. 54, CD wrote: ‘from other statements it appeared probable that Pyrola might be heterostyled, but H. Müller examined for me two species in North Germany, and found this not to be the case’.</note>

Müller described the structure and pollination mechanism of <hi rend="italic">L. miniata</hi> in his letter to CD of 23 March 1867. He thought he had identified male and female flowers; however, Hildebrand had observed that in <hi rend="italic">L. coronata</hi>, the male parts of the flower matured first, and were replaced by the female parts when they had withered away. The flowers were therefore dichogamous and it was impossible for them to pollinate themselves.</note>
