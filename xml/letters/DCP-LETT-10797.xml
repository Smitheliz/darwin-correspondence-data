<p>I beg a little space in your journal to confess my error with respect to the cause of the scarcity of Holly berries. I have been convinced of this by the two communications in your last number, by a statement in the <hi rend="underline">Garden</hi> by Mr. Fish, and by some private letters which I have received.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It appears that several causes in combination have led to this scarcity; but I still think that the rarity of bees of all kinds in this neighbourhood during the spring, of which fact I feel assured, may have played a part, though a quite subordinate one.</p>

Fish remarked that although most trees had few berries, occasional ones had a full complement, and this fact could hardly be ascribed to the scarcity of bees. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4788.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Murton Tracy</ref> had made a similar point, having observed that a couple of trees in sheltered spots had many berries (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-10779.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from G. M. Tracy, 11 January 1877</ref>). Fish wrote a longer reply to CD that appeared on the same page of <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle</hi> as CD’s letter.</note>
