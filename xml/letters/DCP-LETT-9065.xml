<p>I was very glad to get your note, as only a few days ago I was much wishing to hear where &amp; how you were.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I received the apples only today, as they were directed to Beckenham instead of to Orpington Station; &amp; I have been very glad carefully to compare them.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>The seedlings from the same parent are wonderfully alike in the fruit &amp; apparently in their now withered leaves. I forget what Hooker says; but I have long been well aware that reversions to the crab-state are exceptional &amp; far from close.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Indeed the wild crabs themselves are very perplexing &amp; differ much. If you care to see what I have said very briefly on the subject, you will find a passage in my Var. under Dom. Vol. 2. p. 350 &amp; a line or 2 in Vol 1. p 31—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I do not believe that inheritance is so general with apple trees, as Mr Wood thinks. Many have tried, but no one has raised a new Ribstone or Golden Pippin; tho’ one of Andrew Knight’s seedlings makes an approach to the latter.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The most surprising statement in Mr Wood’s letter seems to me to be about the sterility of his seedlings, as I suppose they must now be several years old.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It is still more remarkable that his parent trees were not intercrossed, as probably many kinds were in flower at the same time. As I can hardly doubt that bees must carry pollen from tree to tree (which c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be easily proved by cutting off the stamens of several flowers before they opened, &amp; afterwards examining the stigmas) it really looks as if the pollen of the above named vars. was prepotent over that of other vars; &amp; if so they certainly have the character of species.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> It w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be a grand experiment to fertilize some flowers of the Hawthornden with pollen <hi rend="underline">from a distinct plant</hi> or best a seedling of the <hi rend="underline">same</hi> var. &amp; with pollen of some other &amp; very different var., &amp; see the character of the seedlings thus produced; but I am too old for such a work.</p>
<p>I have been rather bad of late, &amp; am now under very strict orders by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> A. Clark;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> but I very much hope that later in the autumn, if a little change w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> do you any good, that you will pay us a visit together with Miss Lyell. Her name vividly recalls many delightful evenings in Hart S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
