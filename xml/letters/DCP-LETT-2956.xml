<p>My dear Sir</p>
<p>We return to “Down Bromley Kent” on 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. —<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I have heard from Huxley about the Nat. Hist. Review<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; it has my good wishes &amp; I shall certainly take it in.—   I really know nothing whatever about vegetable irritability (it is quite beyond my scope) except in case of Orchids; I have a large mass of notes with many new facts, but I resolutely, <hi rend="underline">against my inclination</hi>, put them away a month ago with the determination to work them up &amp; get drawings made at some distant period;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> for I am convinced that I ought to work on Variation &amp; not amuse myself with interludes.— Drosera was an accident owing to my being from home &amp; having nothing to do.—   My paper on Drosera, from containing minute particulars of numerous experiments, would not, I think, be fitted for the Review; &amp; if I do not deceive myself some of the results are sufficiently curious to be published in some old standing Transactions. Where I shall send them I know not yet; as I cannot judge of evidence till all my experiments are tabulated &amp; that will be a long job.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I may add that I told Huxley some months ago that I really could not assist by writing; I may add that my health is so weak that I cannot work above 3 hour a day; &amp; I am at all times a most slow worker.—</p>
<p>I am so much obliged to you for going to try C. of Ammonia on Dionæa.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> expect (but expectations are oftener wrong than right) that of C. of Ammonia on disc of leaf would cause it to shut slowly; but would produce no effect on back of leaf or on marginal spikes.—   What it will do on the sensitive lamina, Heaven only knows.—   I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. expect <hi rend="underline">after</hi> leaf has closed that each of the little tortoise-shell glands on the disc of leaf would secrete a minute bead of liquor. I must have expressed myself badly,—it is the red fluid being broken up or segregated with-in the sensitive lamina of a <hi rend="underline">closed</hi> leaf, as in Drosera, which seems to me the important point of accordance; &amp; not so much the action of C. of Ammonia on the red-fluid in the sensitive Hairs &amp; tortoise-shell-like glands.—   I will try, &amp; sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not be in the least surprised, at C. of Ammonia acting on the fluid in cells of common leaves.—</p>
<p>My dear Sir | With many thanks | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
