<p>Preparing paper on seed-soaking for Linnean Society ["Action of sea-water on seeds", <hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi> 1: 264–73]. Wants to use MJB’s results. Lost ardour when he found seeds would not float.</p> 
            <p>Has grown MJB’s purest pea seeds and got a few variants. Gärtner’s experiments suggest direct action of pollen, but CD thinks it is "mere variation".</p>

<p>At Hookers suggestion I am going to send to Linnean Soc, an account of the few experiment which I made on salting seeds,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; I want to know whether you will permit me to tabulate your results with mine.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I thought of arranging the genera in their nat. Families—</p>
<p>I had intended trying many more experiments but my ardor was damped, by finding that plants would float for so short a time in salt-water:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am, however, not quite sure that I tried this part of the affair quite fairly, so shall try the floating again— I kept the plants in the water in my room &amp; therefor too warm &amp; in nearly the dark, &amp; this might have hastened their decay. Will you be so kind as to tell me the proper name of the Aubergine &amp; Corn Salad &amp; of the Kidney Bean; I tried the <hi rend="underline">dwarf</hi>.— was yours the tall or dwarf?</p>
<p>I hope you will excuse me troubling you &amp; believe me Dear Sir | Yours sincerely &amp; obliged | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>Do you think it of any consequence how I arrange the Families: sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> I follow Lindley or put the Families by mere chance, keeping, perhaps, Endogens &amp; Exogens apart?—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It will take me some little time to find out order of the Natural Families—</p>
<p>I planted the curious Peas you were so kind as to send me near some other kinds, but unfortunately they were gathered before they were quite ripe, so that I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not tell positively whether they had been affected.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> But another lot of “Pois sans parchemin”, which were ticketed as your purest seed, were sown separately &amp; have come nearly true, yet some few of the peas were not mottled with brown, &amp; I do not think they could have been impregnated with the pollen of any other variety.— A neighbour has a curious pea with black pods, &amp; these when planted by themselves sometimes come false. This leads me to ask whether you do not think that the change in the seed may be due to mere variation, &amp; not to the anomalous &amp; direct action of the pollen.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I have forgotten, indeed, Gærtner’s experiments, which certainly seem to prove direct action of the pollen.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Yet on other hand how strange it is that nurserymen take no pains to prevent crossing in the Peas which they raise from seed close together—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> And in Sweet Peas they <hi rend="underline">certainly</hi> come true if planted <hi rend="underline">quite close</hi> together. Have you tried any other experiments? Can you throw any light on this point which interests me extremely?<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I have a small collection of Pois sans Parchemin from Vilmorin,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> —all his varieties of this sub-class: Have you any wish for a sample of each kind?— One word more, there seems to me capital evidence <hi rend="underline">for</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">against</hi> the <hi rend="underline">natural</hi> crossing of Pisum &amp; Lathyrus, &amp; I am completely puzzled.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
