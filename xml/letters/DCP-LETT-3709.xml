<p>I am sorry you had trouble of writing two notes,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but I thank you <hi rend="underline">sincerely</hi> for the flowers of Lythrum, which I shall carefully examine with great interest.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Unless L. hyssopifolium presents 2 or 3 forms (which I do not believe) I am astounded at D. C. speaking of L. Graefferi as possibly the same as L. hyssop.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> They are totally unlike!— I am truly obliged for the specimens, for I feel a strange interest in this case. As you say it will be laborious to prove the case;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> but before I left home, I castrated marked, &amp; fertilised in 18 methods above a hundred flowers, &amp; protected them from insects.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am much obliged for your Photograph.;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I have none to <hi rend="underline">match</hi> of myself, but I have one made by my son, which I will send when at home if you care to have it.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Thanks, also, for diagram of Compositæ, in which the “&amp;c.” means I fear that all cases are not represented.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> By chance the day before I was looking at the marygold &amp; was puzzled by the apparently different stigma of the ray florets which, do not seem to produce seed.— But a man must be a Botanist to think about so gigantic an order: moreover it would be hardly possible to experiment by crossing.</p>
<p>Thanks again about Bolle or Rolle; which I will ascertain, when I get my copy from Lyell:<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I fancied from some remarks that he might be a Botanist; but my wife<ref target="#foot.f11"/> read it Rolle as well as I did.—</p>
<p>Having nothing on earth to do here, I have been working a little bit at the never-ending Drosera: as the glands absorb so readily &amp; the Hairs move so rapidly under certain stimulants, it seemed a good opportunity to test how far this plant was sensitive to various vegetable substances, which are known to act energetically on the nervous system of animals.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> As yet I can make out no sort of rule; but the difference in action is very great. Thus, strychnine produces no effect; belladonna causes movement, as does veratrine; Henbane does <hi rend="underline">not</hi> cause movement, but does not in the least check subsequent &amp; immediate action of meat.— Opium on the other hand, does not cause movement, but afterwards meat instead of causing movement in less than one minute, does not act for 2, or 3 or 4 hours—it puts the plant to sleep! I wonder whether analogous experiments have been tried on other plants; but anyhow I shall go on, as it amuses me &amp; passes the time.</p>
<p>But why do I waste your time?— I suppose for same reason it amuses me &amp; passes the time, so forgive me &amp; believe me, Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>

However, there is in DAR 142 an envelope addressed to CD in Oliver’s hand, which is postmarked ‘SP 16 62’ (London) and ‘SP 17 62’ (Poole and Bournemouth) (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1163.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Calendar</hi></ref> no. 13891f). This probably contained a letter and specimens sent in response to CD’s letter of 14 September [1862] (see n. 4, below); CD’s letter and Oliver’s letter of 13 September 1862 had apparently crossed in the post.</note>

In a note in DAR 27.2 (ser. 2): 14, CD recorded that the specimen had been identified at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, as <hi rend="italic">L. Graefferi.</hi> The envelope of Oliver’s missing letter of 16 September 1862 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1163.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Calendar</hi></ref> no. 13891f; see n. 2, above) is annotated in CD’s hand ‘Lythrum Graefferi’, and was preserved as a receptacle for several dried specimens of <hi rend="italic">L. Graefferi</hi>, including that originally sent to Oliver by CD; the descriptions on the wrappers of most of the remaining thirteen specimens are in Oliver’s hand. However, since Oliver sent further specimens of the flowers of <hi rend="italic">L. Graefferi</hi> in October (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3753.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 6 October [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3758.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Daniel Oliver, 13 October [1862]</ref>), it is impossible to identify which of the specimens were sent on this occasion. CD’s notes on the first set of specimens sent by Oliver are in DAR 27.2 (ser. 2): 15.</note>

Babington, 2 September [1862]</ref>), obtaining fresh specimens from Oliver and dried specimens from Sarah Elizabeth Wedgwood early in September 1862 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3720.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Daniel Oliver, 14 September [1862]</ref> and nn. 2 and 3).</note>

CD’s question was probably prompted by his having received a copy of the first part of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6704.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Rolle 1863</ref>, which he had subsequently lent to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3747.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 1 October [1862]</ref> and n. 2).</note>

He had hoped to continue and complete the experiments in the summer of 1861, but subsequently decided to postpone them (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3057.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 4 February [1861]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3251.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Daniel Oliver, 11 September [1861]</ref>); he carried out a small number of experiments in May 1862 (see the observational notes dated 18 and 21 May 1862 in DAR 54: 74–5). There are notes detailing his extensive experiments with the species between 14 and 26 September 1862 in DAR 54: 29–49; on 17 September, CD carried out a set of experiments with the substances described in this letter. See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3738.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 26 September [1862]</ref>.
