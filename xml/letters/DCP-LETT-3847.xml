<p>I should have been glad to publish—as you desire me, a paper on the Primulas, had my <hi rend="underline">materials</hi> for such been sufficient.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> This however is not the case. My observations have been entirely confined to the examination of the relative length of the sexual organs, and I have never tested their comparative fertility. In regard to this point in the few non-dimorphic forms, I have given in my list, one only—P. Scotica—is cultivated here.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The plants of this—as you suppose—have not been raised from seeds with us, but introduced from their native habitats. It—non-dimorphism—cannot therefore, in these cases as in P. Sinensis which you mention,—be an effect of Cultivation, as I find it the same in native specimens of P. <hi rend="underline">Scotica</hi>, and the few others similarly conditioned were native specimens likewise.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have just heard of a young <hi rend="underline">M.D.</hi> who intends bringing forward some objections to your views on Primula.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have not been able to ascertain what these are, but I shall make it a point to do so on Thursday first when I expect to meet him at the Botanical Society’s Meeting. I am fully anticipating that they are founded on the conditions of P. Scotica—as he has frequently been North and gathered it. if so, however, your case of Linum may meet all the difficulties he will urge.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>By the way, I may here state that I intend to read a short paper, on the <hi rend="underline">Irritability</hi> &amp;c. of <hi rend="underline">Drosera</hi> to the Society on Thursday.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am very much puzzled with the capricious appearance of this phenomena in such widely different parts of the Vegetable Kingdom. So far as I remember in my overhasty perusal of your ‘Origin’, you do not refer to this point. May I be permitted to ask you, if you explain its <hi rend="underline">isolated appearances</hi>, in the same manner as the electric phenomena of fishes? of which I have taken a note.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>When I first observed the difference in the length of styles in Siphocampylus, I thought it might be analogous to Lobelia, and that the shorter styled flowers were not yet fully developed. This I find is not the case. I now enclose a few withered flowers showing stigma expanded with styles scarcely longer than stamens. In referring to this case, however, it was merely in analogical illustration of those forms of Primula, where the length of stigma varies, which as I hinted might in them as in Siphocampylus, be the first indication of dimorphism.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> The existence—on the authority of Lindley, and of which you may perhaps be aware, as I have not yet ascertained the species—of a structurally dioecious Lobelia,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> furthermore induced me to mention Siphocampylus, as I supposed such a state consequent on analogous changes, to those you have demonstrated in Primula. I may, however, after all be in an error about it, and I now merely state these points; which I thought justified my inference. I have made no notice of Clivia, nor have I counted the seeds.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> This I will now, have an opportunity of doing, as the hybrid &amp; one of its parents are at present in flower</p>
<p>You kindly ask me if there is any of your books I would like.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I can assure you Sir, that any of them would be a highly valued boon, but since you ask me to mention one, I will indeed feel deeply obliged and honoured of your presenting me with a copy of your Journal, which I have less frequently seen than the Origin.</p>
<p>The experiments you suggest on Cattleya shall be attended to as soon as an opportunity presents itself.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> At present, unfortunately there are none of them in flower. <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Lælia</hi> <hi rend="underline">anceps</hi>, however, will be in flower shortly, and I will experiment upon it. It shall indeed afford me a pleasure to make any experiments you may be pleased to suggest. I will be glad to here of many more.</p>
<p>I will try and state my difficulties with Natural Selection in some future letter.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I may here state, however, that it is not the mere question of variability, but the reproductive inheritance which presents difficulties to me. I send, by post a copy of my paper treating upon the reproduction of varieties of Ferns, on which I will be glad to hear any remarks, as I believe the relations of the sexual organs in the higher plants greatly infacilitates the reproduction of individual variations.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> That—in fact—the facilities for such are inversely proportionate, to the more or less intimate association of these organs. The most favourable condition for such being presented by Ferns, where the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">genitalia</hi> are the products of a single organ, and the least favourable by the diœcious Phænogams where these are produced by distinct individuals.</p>
<p>This subject I may state has engaged me for sometime back, and I now am inclined to think, that the views you advocate in your Orchid Book, are directly opposed to those I have adopted in my paper on the Ferns, where I apply it to like phenomena in the Higher Plants. That in short—all unfavourable to your views of variation, might—according to mine—regard that unknown great good derived from the union of distinct individuals which you speak of;<ref target="#foot.f16"/> as a natural institution for the prevention of any continuous flux in the forms of Vegetative Life. Inasmuch, as in this kingdom—it will rarely happen that two individuals having like differences will fertilise each other. And thus though each may individually present a departure from the normal specific type, the resultant of this combined action, will not blend their idyosyncrasies—if I may so speak. This immediate change in the genitive conditions, having a tendency to call into energetic action the somewhat latent specific formative power, and so efface the individual tendencies of both.</p>
<p>Time, however, does not at present permit me to enter fully and clearly, into these matters, which in fact are the basis of my difficulties with Natural Selection. With many thanks for the attention you have been pleased to honour me with, I remain</p>

He observed that in such cases of ‘two very distinct species furnished with apparently the same anomalous organ’, some ‘fundamental difference’ could generally be found, and continued: <quote type="quote"> I am inclined to believe that … natural selection, working for the good of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations, has sometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings, which beings owe but little of their structure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor. </quote></note>
