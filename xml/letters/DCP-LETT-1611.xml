<p>Bentham’s list of aberrant genera: CD’s worry that he eliminated large genera <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> is half right. He eliminated those large, anomalous genera that virtually constitute natural orders. JDH criticises CD’s tabulations of aberrants.</p>

<p>I will only continue to correspond on the conditions that you will write as often as you want &amp; wish &amp; think I can be of the smallest service— your questions are most profitable for me to work. I saw Bentham today— you are half right &amp; half wrong in your surmise—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> thus Bentham has omitted all very large &amp; anomalous genera that for size may be considered equivalents of Nat. Ords. as well as being Nat Ords from peculiarity—as Begoniaceæ for instance, a bona fide nat: ord. with perhaps 160 species, but which neither Bentham nor I would make more than one genus of.— Genera &amp; nat ords are however to such an extended degree arbitrary <hi rend="underline">as to their</hi> <hi rend="underline">limits</hi>, that these questions are all most difficult to work. There is another light however in which you must view these catalogue—which is this, that except you include <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the anomalous genera in the Veg. Kingd:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> it is not fair to take the greatest; because, in taking a miscellaneous selection, the great genera like Begonia Nepenthes &amp; Cassytha will always come up to mind from their being so familiar, whereas the little known anomalous genera of few or one species are not recollected &amp; many of them <hi rend="doubleUnderline">not known</hi> to even a learned Botanist. In other words for every anomalous genus big with species there are 50 of one or very few species, but a person in making a <hi rend="underline">miscellaneous</hi> selection jumps at the big ones &amp; overlooks the small.</p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a1" type="annotationStart"/>My grave objection to the whole process is, that if you multiply the anomalous species by 100 &amp; divide<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> the normal by the same you will then reverse the names, for <hi rend="doubleUnderline">anomaly</hi> is to a great extent synonymous with <hi rend="underline">rarity</hi> or <hi rend="underline">representation</hi> <hi rend="underline">by few</hi> <hi rend="underline">species</hi>. EG. as plants go now adays, Lepidodendron is an anomaly; but as years ago i.e. in the coal epoch no doubt a Rose would have been an anomaly— also substituting space for time &amp; we have Proteaceæ anomalies in the S. American Flora &amp; Fuchsias in the Australian— Destroy Australia &amp; the Cape &amp; what a deuced odd anomalous order <hi rend="underline">Proteaceæ</hi> become.— perhaps however I am (to you) reasoning in a circle, &amp; arguing from the conclusion you want to arrive at. We must take the world &amp; its Veg. Kingd. as it is however, &amp; I can see that a great deal should be made out of a proper tabulation of anomalous genera.— The curse of Botany is the extreme difficulty of determining the affinities of plants &amp; of limiting groups— they represent one another &amp; inosculate &amp; repeat forms &amp; present an impenetrable barrier to the distinguishing between affinity &amp; analogy. The three great groups Acot. Monocot &amp; Dicot. are absolutely defined &amp; limited; but amongst Dicots there are but few absolutely limited natural orders, &amp; not only do most of the orders blend in every way but the most distinct contain species &amp; groups which imitate in outward appearance plants with which the order to which they belong has no real affinity this enhances the difficulty tenfold. In all my experience I know no science so difficult as that of the affinities of plants.— it can only be got by dissection &amp; study; it cannot be learned &amp; what is worse cannot be expressed except by details.— Upon the whole I am inclined to take Benthams list as a fair selection but the only other way I can suggest of working out the point is to take single orders &amp; seek the proportions that the anomalous genera in them bear to the typical genera.</p>
<p>To return—you will therefore understand that Bentham did not exclude large genera simply because they were large, but he did so where these were large &amp; also represented Nat. Ords. I quite agree that your plan is to take anomalous forms of whatever value, but if you only take a selection from the Veg. K. you should beware of including the very big ones or you will have an undue preponderance of them.</p>
<p>With regard to splitting Australia,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> you say I underrate the consequent effect on all the species— now I rather shirked that as being a purely hypothetical point; <anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>the fact that three fourths? would be killed &amp; that a greater proportion of those common to both would be killed than of those peculiar to each,<anchor xml:id="ann.a4" type="annotationEnd"/> appear to be the great consequences— do you mean that besides this some species now distinct would assimilate, or that those now the same would be altered in each &amp; in different ways?</p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a5" type="annotationStart"/>I send you the results of the Aquilegia work,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> on which Thomson &amp; I spent many hours &amp; he good three weeks of indomitable perseverance with every accessable book &amp; specimen wild &amp; garden dried &amp; alive It is badly composed, but was one of the first of Thomsons trials at writing out his results: three revises were corrected after this but I am sorry we have not a clearer one: therefore excuse errors in this &amp; return it at your leisure. it is not yet published— <anchor xml:id="ann.a7" type="annotationStart"/>we shall send you a copy when it is. there are about 400 more pages printed of the Flora Indica;<anchor xml:id="ann.a8" type="annotationEnd"/> I am as sure as can be that there is but one European &amp; Himalayan <hi rend="underline">Aquilegia</hi> out of which 30 are made &amp; I suspect that Poeonia &amp; <hi rend="underline">very many</hi> other genera are<anchor xml:id="ann.a6" type="annotationEnd"/></p>

Now I dispute the former proposition: if ornithorhynchus was made into a very large genus (according to analogy it c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not be multiplied by 100) &amp; Echidna into another, they w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> hardly be a whit less anomalous than now. But if you made <hi rend="italic">many</hi> genera, [‘somewhat intermediate between these’ <hi rend="italic">del</hi>] round about these, giving them either few or many species then they w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be not anomalous. So Marsupialia can hardly be considered anomalous but if Didelphys existed alone, whether there was one or as at present some dozen species, it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be vastly anomalous.— Earwig with species all over world is very anomalous.— Sagitta most anomalous, yet I believe is at least a dozen species; if another 12 discovered in Pacific it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> remain equally anomalous.— This being the case it becomes a very fair subject of investigation whether the species in anomalous groups, are few or many, taking nearest &amp; smallest groups, ie genera (as standard). *It might by my theory be expected that they w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be few; possibly with exceptions.—[<hi rend="italic">added in pencil</hi>] N.B. I can make one great discussion about extinction in relation to individual species *rarity preceding extinction.—[<hi rend="italic">interl</hi>] (law of wide range &amp; long duration in time) different rates of change in [<hi rend="italic">over</hi>‘.—’] different classes—on relation to aberrant or anomalous genera.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> If organisms disappear slowly there is some slight probability that they w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. appear slowly &amp; they do appear slowly.— </note>
