                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
<p>I am truly obliged to you for your very kind letter &amp; offer of specimens of Alcippe.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> You cannot imagine how much I shall <hi rend="underline">enjoy</hi> seeing in your Paper &amp; in actual specimens a new form of cirripede;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> for I am wearied out with examining scores &amp; scores of closely allied common cirripedes.—</p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have written about Lithotrya in former letter, but I had hardly space, &amp; I did not know whether you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to have my views, on this point.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I conclude that the L. forms its own holes from having seen <hi rend="underline">numerous specimens</hi>, (&amp; 4 or 5 <hi rend="underline">species</hi>) large &amp; small, all <hi rend="underline">exactly</hi> fitting their cavities. The calcareous cup is indisputably (I speak after careful examination with dissolution in acids &amp;c &amp;c) formed by the cirripede &amp; is common to most (I believe all) the species of genus. You are perfectly right that the calc. cup is never moved. But the cirripede inhabits (as far as I have seen) only cellular rocks, or corals, or shells (such as the cirripede Conia, with large tubes) &amp; the pupa crawls into some minute cavity &amp; there fixes itself for ever, &amp; then as it grows enlarges the hole to required size; this it effects by the edges of the valves &amp; of the minute scales on the peduncle, being sharply serrated; &amp; as of course the serrated edge would soon be blunted, the calcareous scales on the peduncle are moulted with the membrane on which they are fixed, &amp; new sharp ones periodically formed.— This (ie moulting of calc. scales) is a unique case, &amp; I have no doubt is in relation to their boring necessities.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I believe this is the way which my Arthrobalanus which inhabits the Concholepas, also makes its cavities &amp; its outer tissue is studded with elegant minute trifid &amp; 4-fid points; &amp; the shell is apparently first perforated by other animals;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> but I have got to go over this again with Arthrobalanus, but I have had the misfortune to lose nearly my whole stock of specimens, of which I collected thousands, for 15 years ago in the Chonos archipelago I described its peculiarities in some detail.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I venture to predict that if you take the outer tissue of Alcippe &amp; clear the corium from it &amp; place it under the compound microscope, you will find the rasping minute points, &amp; I believe you state that it inhabits shells abounding with cavities of Cliona &amp;c &amp;c.—</p>
<p>I am most particularly obliged to you for informing me of Lovens cirripede,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> of which I had not heard.— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be <hi rend="underline">most grateful</hi> for a transcript of the paper &amp; drawing—or if the book be not above 2 lb. or two precious c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. it not be sent &amp; I would gratefully repay postage, &amp; thus save M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alder<ref target="#foot.f8"/> the trouble of transcribing, to whom pray give my sincere thanks. I have in my collection this Cirripede as I suspect; it is like an Otion, &amp; from not having calc. valves might be called an Alepas, but strange as it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. appear to any one, who had not studied the internal structure of these animals, it is not even one of the Pedunculata, but belongs to the sessile division, &amp; forms a new genus between Tubicinella &amp; Coronula.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have been very sorry to have overlooked Loven’s description.—</p>
<p>I presume you have a superabundance of materials, but if at any time you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to have my small collection of naked mollusca, made during my circumnavigation, they are at your service; but I fear specimens preserved for many years in spirits, must be almost useless.— I think there are some new genera amongst them.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Once again allow me to thank you cordially for the very kind manner in which you have taken my request &amp; believe me, dear Sir | Your’s sincerely obliged | C. Darwin <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> To | A. Hancock Esq<hi rend="superscript">e</hi></p>
<p>I see in the Athenæum they have omitted to express how valuable I thought your discovery &amp; how interesting your whole paper.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I am very curious to see what you say about the palpi, I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not follow the reading aloud, of this part, but if I understood right, the palpi are wonderfully different from anything I have ever seen in the Cirripedia.— I think it possible that Alcippe &amp; Arthrobalanus may turn out distinct <hi rend="underline">orders</hi>— The metamorphosis is certainly different— my larva has no <hi rend="underline">thoracic</hi> legs, whereas yours has. mine is binocular, yours uniocular &amp;c &amp;c. Yet the 3 pair of cirri, the great lab〈rum〉 &amp; habits are certainly strong points 〈o〉f resemblance.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I ought to apologise for the length of this letter.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In his lecture presented at the Birmingham meeting of the British Association in 1849, Hancock stated that <hi rend="italic">Alcippe</hi> was the only cirripede known to burrow into a chamber of its own making. He mentioned that <hi rend="italic">Lithotrya</hi>, the other genus believed to burrow, rather appeared to inhabit pre-existing cavities in calcareous bodies. CD disagreed with this opinion. In his comments on Hancock’s presentation, he stated: ‘had Mr. Hancock examined specimens, instead of drawings, of the Lithotria in rock, he would almost certainly have acknowledged its power of excavating cavities.—’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 1: 251).</note>

Hancock appended a note to the discussion of <hi rend="italic">Lithotrya</hi> in his paper on <hi rend="italic">Alcippe</hi> (A. Hancock 1849b, p. 313 n.): <quote> Whilst this was passing through the press I have been assured by Mr. C. Darwin, and his opinion on this subject is of the greatest value, that the dorsal cup of <hi rend="italic">Lithotrya</hi> is undoubtedly formed by the animal, and that it has the power of enlarging the cavities in which the larva takes up its abode.</quote> He remained, however, unconvinced (see especially <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1378.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Albany Hancock, 25 December [1850]</ref>).</note>
