            <p>Surprised and delighted by Mr Rich’s bequest as it will greatly increase his income. Intends to leave money to the Royal Society to contribute to science. Houses in London are a good investment even in times that are nervous for bankers.</p>

                    <p>I was greatly surprised and delighted by your letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am certain no one in the world so well deserves the honour M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich has paid you as you do.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It is a great happiness to us children to know that strangers recognize what your life has been. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich must be a magnanimous old gentleman and we all owe him respect &amp; gratitude.</p>
<p>It is a splendid honour to science as well as to you, and is a good sign how the world is moving to put science in its right place. The fortune is very considerable and will be a fair increase to all our incomes.</p>
                    <p>In my will I have left a trifle (£250) to the Royal Soc. I shall ultimately make this £1000 or so as being the only thing I can do for science.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>Sara<ref target="#foot.f5"/> sends her best love and is heartily rejoiced as I am. We are both looking forward to Christmas when I shall be very curious to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich’s letters.</p>
                    <p>I think you do not think well enough of the property; I should say houses in London E.C. with a good term to run are as good an investment as could be found any where.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> These are nervous times for Bankers, but we are perfectly right. and do not fear any run.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Our love to mother | goodbye dear Father, your affect son. W E Darwin</p>
