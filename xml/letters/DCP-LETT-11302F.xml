<p>We sent yr proofs because we are not certain whether you are coming tomorrow or not.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have done Ricinus which certainly nutates when bent into a knuckle.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I failed with Maize. I am doing a hazel which has come up &amp; which is certainly moving &amp; I think it is real nutation. The blackened oats have sent out leaves but they are broad &amp; short.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Bernard is all right &amp; very jolly.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Horace is rather languid but working at the wormograph. Yesterday no power could extract the bar but he has had a clamp made by Reeves.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> How is Richard going on?<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Yr affec son | Frank Darwin</p>
<p>Many thanks for Nature which I have sent off<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is conjectured from the reference to CD’s return to Down, and from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1226.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Horace Darwin’s</ref> work on the worm stone (see nn. 2 and 6, below).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD was in London from 26 to 29 October 1877 (CD’s ‘Journal’ (Appendix II)). The proofs have not been identified.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD had received a specimen of <hi rend="italic">Ricinus communis</hi> (castor-oil plant), along with other plants, from Kew on 3 July 1877 (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-11043.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, 9 July [1877]</ref> and n. 2). Nutation is the term used to describe the revolving movement made by the tip of various parts of a plant as it grows; in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5637.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Movement in plants</hi></ref>, pp. 1–4, CD expressed his preference for the term circumnutation to describe this movement.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD was attempting to test the effect of light on plant leaves by blocking it (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11256.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Leonard Darwin, 28 November 1877</ref> and n. 2), probably in order to distinguish between circumnutation and heliotropism. For the results of CD’s experiments with blackened oats (<hi rend="italic">Avena sativa</hi>), see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5637.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Movement in plants</hi></ref>, pp. 167–8.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1226.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Horace Darwin</ref> was building an apparatus to measure the rate at which stones on the surface of the soil are buried by the action of earthworms; it was set up under a large Spanish chestnut tree in the garden at Down House. Horace later reported that in order to construct a fixed point from which the displacement could be measured, a 2.63 metre iron rod was first driven into the ground before being replaced by a copper rod of slightly larger diameter (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10046.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">H. Darwin 1901</ref>, p. 253). Horace purchased a copper rod in London around 24 October 1877 (see letter from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin</ref> to H. E. Litchfield, [<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 25 October 1877] (DAR 219.9: 167). Evidently, the iron rod proved difficult to extract without the aid of the clamp made by the Down blacksmith, William Reeves.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2952.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Buckley Litchfield</ref> had fallen seriously ill while travelling in Switzerland, owing to inept treatment for acute appendicitis (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4832.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Litchfield 1910</ref>, p. 150).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Possibly the issue of <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> that contained both a sketch of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref> and a paper by him (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11210.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J.
