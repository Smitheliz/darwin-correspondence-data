<p>I am not quite certain whether in my letters to you any mention has been made of wild animals suddenly reacquiring their wildness after having been perfectly tamed.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>A friend of mine had a Hare which he had reared from a tiny leverett but a few days old   this animal was as perfectly tame as a dog or cat and would gambol with him &amp; his daughter like a kitten, it was however always kept indoors, it ran about the house &amp; usually had its form in my friends bedroom under the grate.—</p>
<p>One day when I was present the drawing room door was left open   it darted out into the garden &amp; at once made across the country like a wild hare &amp; was no more seen.—</p>
<p>I had a blue bird so tame that it would come immediately it saw me &amp; settle on my hand, and it has flown back to me even when liberated in the garden, one morning this bird watched when I opened the aviary door and at once flew straight away &amp; never returned.— The species was Spiza Cyanea.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>A Siskin quite as tame as the Spiza, served me exactly in the same manner.—</p>
<p>On the other hand I have liberated Crossbills Java Sparrows, Redpoles, &amp; Goldfinches &amp; easily capture〈d〉 them again.—</p>
<p>Cirl Buntings and Reed Buntings liberated would not leave the place but remained about the Garden coming regularly to be fed, but at last fell I fear a prey to the cats.—</p>
