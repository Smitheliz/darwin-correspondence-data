<p>I am much obliged for your various enclosures, viz (1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>) about yourself, &amp; most heartily glad I am that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gully has done you some good.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Emma desires to be most kindly remembered to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Fox &amp; we are very glad that she &amp; the little girl are both well.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I hope that your nephew may succeed in finding some lizard eggs;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> for it seems that he will try his best to ascertain the point in question.— By the way I have just had Helix Pomatia quite healthy after 20 days submersion in salt-water.—</p>
<p>Thanks about Pea case: it is a very great puzzle to me; for if I could trust to my observations on Bees, I cannot see how they can avoid being crossed; but the evidence certainly preponderates on your side, &amp; most heavily in case of Sweet Peas.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I suppose the Queen Pea flowered at same time with adjoining Peas: are you sure of this?</p>
<p>With respect to Clapham School: I think favourably of it: the Boys are not so exclusively kept to Classics: arithmetic is made much of: all are taught drawing, &amp; some modern languages.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I was rather frightened by having heard that it was rather a rough school; but young Herschel did not agree to this;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> &amp; Georgy is rather a soft Boy &amp; I cannot find out that he has anything to complain of, though of a very home-sick, disposition. I will at any time answer any queries in detail: I do not know, but could find out, whether Clergymen’s sons are charged less.—</p>
<p>My wife agrees very heartily with your preachment against overwork, &amp; wishes to go to Malvern; but I doubt: yet I suppose I shall take a little holiday sometime; perhaps to Tenby: though how I can leave all my experiments, I know not.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I am got most deeply interested in my subject; though I wish I could set less value on the bauble fame, either present or posthumous, than I do, but not, I think, to any extreme degree; yet, if I know myself, I would work just as hard, though with less gusto, if I knew that my Book w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be published for ever anonymously</p>
<p>Farewell, my dear Fox | Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>
