<p>You will be surprised by the package which accompanies this—the account of which I will give you at once. One of my daughters was staying some months since at Sydney Dobells in Gloucestershire—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> who shewed her a collection of Butterflies &amp; Moths arranged in a Book preserved as you see the enclosed. They are done by a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Merrin—an Entomologist at Gloucester, who hopes to introduce them into Schools &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Merrin, hearing that I was a connexion of yours, begged that I would be the means of sending these preserved B.<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> to you,—the great desire of his heart being that he should have the honour and glory of presenting them for your approbation.</p>
<p>I told him I would take care you had them, &amp; here they are. The plan is ingenious and answers sufficiently for practical purposes, but alas! the poor Butterflies lose a sad deal of their lustre &amp; beauty in the process. I know nothing whatever of the man, but hear he has published some small works on Entomology.</p>
<p>You will have made him a happy man by accepting them, &amp; they will not burden you by their bulk.</p>
<p>I felt glad of the occurrence as I had been wishful to write to you for some time past but had no particular excuse for doing so.</p>
<p>It is now long since I have heard of you, &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> much like a few lines from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin or yourself, telling me (as I hope) that you are in better health, and that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin &amp; your family are well. Tell me also how Caroline<ref target="#foot.f4"/> is. I should so like to see her &amp; you again. If I go to London this Summer, I shall certainly try to do so.</p>
<p>I am now a regular resident here, having given up Delamere Altogether. I hoped to have met with some Naturalists in the Island, but have not done so at present.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I have outlived almost all my old Isle of Wight friends—&amp; entirely my Naturalist ones.</p>
<p>It was a <hi rend="underline">wrench</hi> to leave my o〈l〉d parsonage where I had spent 〈35〉 happy years, but I felt it right any way.</p>
<p>Here I have been busy in doing what you did at Down—not building a house—but making Gardens &amp;c out of the most unpromising materials I ever had to do with. After buying every potato &amp;c—I have now atchieved a good Kitchen Garden with lots of all Vegetables &amp; a good deal of fruit, &amp; in another year shall look tolerably civilised. Your good Father &amp; Susan &amp; Catherine so often come into my mind when in my Garden.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have got all my old furniture— &amp; remembrances about me, and am very busy and happy. I find old age encreeping upon me, however, more rapidly than I expected. I had looked for its approaches more gradually, but it comes by leaps—and I believe if I live another couple of years I shall be quite an old man.</p>
<p>I am in my 70<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year—does it not seem strange how old we get (you are however younger than me)–but it seems but a few years since we were <hi rend="underline">lads</hi> together. You have worked so hard &amp; gone thro’ so much bad health, that it probably does not seem so to you—the worst of it is with me that— while I lack the power of youth— I feel in myself as young &amp; foolish as ever I was. It seems to me as if at my age—one dwells upon the far past—&amp; the deep future—far more than the present.</p>
<p>But I shall weary you out with my scribbling. I have been delighted with Sir John Lubbocks Thysanura in Ray S<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. It seems to me a most wonderful Book to come from a man known as he is—as a Philosopher, Politician &amp; Banker. The world in general cannot understand how such a mind can care about <hi rend="underline">silver fishes</hi>, as they are commonly called—about the most contemptible &amp; least cared for of the infinitely small.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> He is somewhat like what has been said of the Elephants proboscis— able to root up trees &amp; pick up a needle.</p>
<p>Is your son still a Banker at Southampton &amp; if so what is his Firm there.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I sometimes meditate going over there, &amp; if I did, should much like to see him.</p>
<p>Do you intend publishing a work containing the Sum total of your gatherings— as I think you once did, or are you contented to leave them scattered thro’ your various Vols?</p>
<p>I imagine you have got so into the habit of real work that it is as necessary to you as Idleness seems to me.</p>
<p>That you may have encreased health &amp; many years to work in is the sincere wish of your old &amp; attached Friend W. D. Fox | Kindest regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin from my Wife &amp; self. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
<p>PS. | Do you remember Brachinus crepitans; and our delight on finding it.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have never seen it since those glorious days, until my Boy<ref target="#foot.f10"/> brought in some a week since, as much pleased as we were with it—&amp; as much surprised— They fired away most wonderfully. I dont think they have practised any improvement in Gunnery.</p>
<p>This reminds me of poor little Albert Way. I had no idea when my friend Lady <hi rend="italic">[</hi>Natherton<hi rend="italic">]</hi> told me she was going to the South of France to help to nurse a friends Husband—that Way was the man—until I saw 〈  〉 death lately.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>You probably have often met him— I never have since we three <hi rend="underline">gloried</hi> over Panagæus Crux Major—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Those were days— &amp; I always rejoice over them when I see the old specimens— &amp; think of Henslow<ref target="#foot.f13"/> &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
