                    <p>There are two orphan boys, grandsons of Jimmy Button now at our Mission station, and they the missionaries are anxious to help these boys there and train them up.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The expense for each would be 10£ a year and the elder one has been provided for by the Beckenham Branch of the Mission under the name of “William Beckenham Button”.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>I think it would be a nice thing if the old Beagles would adopt the younger one and call him “Jimmy FitzRoy Button”— He is now called “James” B— If we were each to give 1£ a year it would provide for him, as I think FitzRoy’s family would help. I am writing to all our old party.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Hamond was here recently and he was glad to join. He has gone out to Gibraltar to take his daughter in law (a neice of my wife). and baby out to her Husband who has lately gone out to command a gun boat there.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>I hope you are all well. I have been again confined for a month with cough &amp; cold, and could not go with my wife &amp; daughter to our younger son’s marriage at Dover last week.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am getting all right again and all our party are now out of Doctor’s list.</p>
