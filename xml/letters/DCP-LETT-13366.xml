<p>[Such, however, was not the case with Mr. Darwin.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> When I subsequently ventured to put the similar question to the master, he at once most kindly favoured me with the following reply, which I give in his own words, in order to avoid anything like a mis-statement of his views:— After speaking of there being “some gradation in perfection with mammals in the mammery glands,” and the custom of the young in the <hi rend="underline">Echidna</hi> (of the <hi rend="underline">crab</hi> family), and the <hi rend="underline">Ornithoptera</hi> (of the <hi rend="underline">butterfly</hi> species) “to suck off the surface of its skin, to secrete milk, for there is no nipple,” Mr. Darwin added: ‘In the case of certain fish the ova are hatched in a marsupal sack on the surface of the stomach of the male, and the young when hatched feed on the mucus secreted from the skin lining the sack; and here as I believe, we see what might be the commencement of a simple mammery gland as in <hi rend="underline">Echidna</hi>, &amp;c. This is of course <hi rend="underline">only an hypothesis</hi>. The exact steps in the evolutionary process could be discovered only by the observation of animals which became extinct during the earliest part of the secondary period.”<ref target="#foot.f3"/>]</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is established by the relationship between this letter and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13385.xml">letter from B. W. Savile, 10 October 1881</ref>, in which Savile stated that his reply was delayed because he had been away for two days.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">These letter fragments are from an article published by Savile in the <hi rend="italic">Record</hi>, an Anglican newspaper, after CD’s death. In the article, Savile reported that before writing to CD he had asked <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4839.xml">John Tyndall</ref> ‘how could the first of the mammal species be nourished, if its immediate progenitor was a non-mammal’. Tyndall did not reply.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Although Savile was claimed to be quoting CD’s words, he clearly had no understanding of the animals to which CD referred. The <hi rend="italic">Echidna</hi> is not a genus of crabs, but an egg-laying mammal of the order Monotremata, known as a spiny anteater. <hi rend="italic">Ornithoptera</hi> is a butterfly genus, but it is more likely that CD wrote <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus</hi> (duck-billed platypus), the only other living mammal that lays eggs. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6019.xml"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> 6th ed.</ref>, pp. 189–90, CD had used the example of <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus anatinus</hi>, which had a rudimentary breast but no nipple, to discuss the origin of mammary glands. He had also referred to the fish <hi rend="italic">Hippocampus</hi>, which develops its young in a marsupial sack after their emergence from eggs (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 189).</note>
