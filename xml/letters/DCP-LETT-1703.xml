                <div type="transcription">
<p>I was very happy to receive your letter &amp; so far from any apology being needful, I thank you for this step towards an acquaintancy which I may hope some day to make more fully.</p>
<p>I have not carried my little experiments any further. They had been discontinued long before I read that little paper to our local Philosophical Society,<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> <ref target="#foot.f1"/> but I felt that they ought to be recorded before they became forgott〈en.〉 The <hi rend="underline">Geum rivale</hi> in my garden was itself very little disposed to seed— I have an idea that it only seeded when fertilized with foreign pollen but the resulting hybrid is very fertile &amp; has abundantly seeded ever since &amp; the seedlings have come up by thousands—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have to this day <anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>growing plants and as the situation is always changing it is obvious they must be new plants. They all seed immensely &amp; are precisely the same as the first crop of plan〈ts.〉<anchor xml:id="ann.a4" type="annotationEnd"/></p>
<p>〈Th〉us the <hi rend="underline">G. rivale</hi> fertilise〈  〉 〈    〉 the number of seeds is <hi rend="underline">certainly</hi> vastly more than in the <hi rend="underline">G. rivale</hi>,—if these were 〈    〉 〈mature〉 in that plant which has since died away,—but not quite so many as in <hi rend="underline">G. urbanum</hi> which I have since brought into the garden.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Epilobium <hi rend="underline">Montano-tetragonum</hi> is also very prolific but I cannot speak of number of seeds— I observed the <anchor xml:id="ann.a5" type="annotationStart"/>generations by saving seed to the fourth year &amp; since that they take their chance so that the hybrids, now coming<anchor xml:id="ann.a6" type="annotationEnd"/> up may be only the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. generation or that of any other subsequent number.</p>
<p>I shall be happy to send you 〈  〉eum &amp; capsules of Epilobium when ripe— I hope you will sow them &amp; see the plants.</p>
<p>I think I might have obtained hybrid seeds of <hi rend="underline">Linaria</hi> if I had tried the pollen of <hi rend="underline">L. repens</hi> on the stigma of <hi rend="underline">L. vulgaris</hi> instead of the reverse which is what I attempted—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> In the garden the plants of <hi rend="underline">L. repens</hi> creep so prodigeously that they have still chance for perfecting seed.</p>
<p>I remain, dear Sir | Very faithfully yours | T. Bell Salter C. Darwin Esq.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">A reference to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6866.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Salter 1852</ref>, a paper on the fertility of certain plant hybrids, which was first read before the Isle of Wight Philosophical Society and printed in the <hi rend="italic">Phytologist</hi>. CD may have come across the paper during his bibliographic research at the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1702.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 23 [June 1855]</ref>). CD’s notes on <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6866.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Salter 1852</ref> are in DAR 73: 88–9.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Salter’s experiments had demonstrated that <hi rend="italic">Epilobium roseum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Geum intermedium</hi> were the hybrid offspring of <hi rend="italic">E. montanum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">E. tetragonum</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">G. urbanum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">G. rivale</hi>, respectively. His researches further showed that these hybrids were entirely fertile and could reproduce their kind through any number of generations, unlike most hybrids which will not continue to reproduce beyond three or four generations. Salter suggested that the wild form of <hi rend="italic">G. intermedium</hi> was, in fact, a species of hybrid origin (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6866.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Salter 1852</ref>, p. 740).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD referred to Salter’s experimental work in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi></ref>, p. 102. However, CD went on to say that, according to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3869.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hornschuch 1848</ref>, the two parent species are not always found in association with <hi rend="italic">G. intermedium</hi> and that the case was more complex than mere hybrid origin. See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1648.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Arthur Henfrey, 17 March [1855]</ref>, for CD’s interest in Friedrich Hornschuch’s work.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Salter described his failure to hybridise <hi rend="italic">Linaria repens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L. vulgaris</hi>, but emphasised that these species could indeed be the parents of <hi rend="italic">L. italica</hi>, as his friend <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_653.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Arnold Bromfield</ref> had claimed in an article ‘Notes and occasional observations on some of the rarer British plants growing wild in Hampshire’, <hi rend="italic">Phytologist</hi> 3 (1848): 625–6.</note>
