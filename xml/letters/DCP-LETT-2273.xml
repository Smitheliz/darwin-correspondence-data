<p>Etty has begun Botany by natural system in earnest &amp; made out that a Primrose had a central placenta &amp; was one of the Primulaceæ!— She &amp; Mamma have gone to London today about Etty’s teeth, &amp; I expect them back every minute.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> On Saturday Georgy comes, on Monday Aunt Susan,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; on Wednesday I go to London; so we are all on the move.</p>

<p>I have had no answer to my letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.

However, 14 May 1858 was a Friday, not a Saturday. Since the letter is incomplete, it is possible that the missing portion was written on 15 May and that CD subsequently added the word ‘Saturday’ when the letter was sent.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">The church rate was a tax levied on landowners in each parish for the benefit of the parish church. The church rates were set by the churchwardens, together with parishioners in the vestry. Although it was a compulsory personal charge, collecting the tax often proved problematic, particularly from nonconformists who objected to supporting the established church (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2248.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">EB</hi></ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD may have recently drafted a rough account of his theory of the formation of bees’ cells. In DAR 48 (ser. 2): 75–7, there are three manuscript pages that CD has labelled ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ headed, respectively, ‘<hi rend="italic">If my theory is right</hi>.’, ‘<hi rend="italic">My theory</hi>’, and ‘<hi rend="italic">If my theory fails</hi>’. From the contents, they appear to be an early outline of his views on the formation of bees’ cells. However, in his next letter to William, CD says that he has ‘come to heavy grief’ over his theory (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-2266.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to W. E.
