                    <p>Many happy Xmas and new years to you all. We are rather a poor lot just now, as my wife is the only well one, Sophy and I bad colds, and Fanny—confined to her bed—but getting better.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>I was so much pleased at seeing your son with his very nice and bright wife at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Langton’s, I wish they could have remained a little longer.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> My eldest son, commanding Britomart at Cowes, has also being preparing for being married one day to a daughter of a very good clergyman—Light—the Rector of Dover, we hear from many quarters that she is a most excellent girl clever and bright, and that he is fortunate to have got her. Unfortunately he is 5<hi rend="superscript">ft</hi>. 5<hi rend="superscript">in</hi>. she 5f<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. <hi rend="underline">8</hi> inches. His frequent visits in gunboat to Dover on Coast Guard duty for some time past has brought this about. They have one good thing in Common   They are both “total abstainers”.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>I do not think I have told you that I saw poor Jemmy Johnson<ref target="#foot.f4"/> at Southsea lately: and old age I find prevents my recollecting as I ought. He is still paralysed in one arm and leg; and though cheery v much like what he was, yet now and then his mind evidently failed him, and he would mix up past events curiously; but fully alive to all old Beagle days, &amp; much interested in hearing all I could tell him of you. His pretty daughter, deaf and dumb from 7 years old through fever—but married four years since to a fine clever young Engineer Officer, &amp; with a dear little girl—I found to my surprise able to hear a little, and recovering speech so much that she could give me a message for my daughters.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> His poor son’s death evidently weighed on his mind still. So clever passing 1. 1. 1—&amp; drawing beautifully from a boy, dying, as a young Lieut—of <hi rend="underline">Drink</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>All join in | kind regards | &amp; best wishes | Believe me | Dear Darwin | Yours most sinc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. | B. J. Sulivan</p>
                    <p>I was delighted with the reception at Cambridge<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>I do not think I sent you our Magazine with account of journey in Patagonia. I enclose the leaves.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
