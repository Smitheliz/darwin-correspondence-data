<p>I applied to you two years ago. A stranger and a foreigner, I then had no other reason for doing so, than the high opinion such greatest men, both in France and in Germany, as are best able to appreciate the immense step forward your genius caused science to make, have conceived of you. I have devoted my whole life to the natural sciences, but I must only revere you as a pupil would a greatest and most beloved teacher; a pupil too humble to allow himself to bear a judgment on a man of your description. Well the opinion of those greatest men made me think, that your heart must be as good as your mind is vast and noble. I was not mistaken.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> And now after having done all a gentleman can do to help himself, I apply again to you, under the following circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The subscription two years ago was to help me, but the letter of Professor J. H. Gladstone will tell you that it left me where I was, for when one month after you had put your name to it, I stopped it myself, and wanted to go to France, I was in such distress that I had to apply to him for the means to leave this country.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am a German Doctor but having also a highest degree of the French University I went to France to apply for a professorship. The noble-minded and best-hearted senator once Minister of public instruction “Jules Simon” did all he could but I, unfortunately could not wait.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I lectured on different natural-scientific subjects, returned again to England, and left it again with my library and apparatus, twenty-two large boxes, weighing more than two tons. 17 of these boxes, are still in the custom-house at Amsterdam, for I could not pay the charges on them about £35, and they will be sold, if in the shortest possible time, I do not redeem them. If they are sold, I shall lose my apparatus, without which I could not lecture, or work, and also the greater part of my library. I should lose what would cost me more than £200 if I had to buy it again. Besides these 17 boxes, I had five boxes containing the botanical part of my library. These five boxes I had with me for I intended to lecture on exotic botany at Cologne. I send you the prospectus, because there is a very beautiful recommendation of myself and the lectures, Professor D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Schellen wrote on the second page of my prospectus.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Cologne, where I wished to deliver these lectures, is unfortunately not a town, which encourages scientific pursuits, and I did not succeed. I was compelled to return again to England. These five boxes, are in London with Sutton &amp; Co, 17 Aldersgate S<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi>. City, only £5 are the charges, but I have not been able to redeem them and they have been there the last five months; and all that time, I have again been in very great distress and without a book, and even without the greatest part of my clothes and linen etc. These boxes too are in danger, the warehousing will eat them up. The money-lender has my watch and all I could pledge, for I do not apply to others, if I can help. I want £12 and I applied to a friend, Gathorne Hardy (now Viscount Cranbrook)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I send you his letter.</p>
<p>Professor Darwin, these circumstances of bitter distress and danger must excuse me, if I apply again to you. I know I have not the slightest claim nor right but I love you as a most grateful pupil can love a best teacher. I may also say that all your works, and it was with great difficulty I bought them are; at least, the botanical ones, in the five boxes I have here in London at Sutton’s &amp; Co. If I had £50 I could save my 17 boxes at Amsterdam, and also all I have in London, but I cannot ask so large a sum, though it would save as it were, my future, for I naturally want my chemical and other apparatus and books; but for the present, it would already be a great benefit, if I had £12 or £15, to redeem the botanical part of my library and my clothes which are at Sutton &amp; Co here in London, and other things which are with the money-lenders and without which I cannot do.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Jules Simon has recommended me to one of his once Inspectors of public instruction. I hope, I shall soon have occupation till then I must continue in distress, but it would be very bitter if I lost all I have, and so put in danger my future, as then I could hardly accept occupation even if I found it.</p>
<p>It is only such deepest distress which can excuse my applying to you, I know that, but, what can I do?</p>
<p>Professor Darwin, whatever your decision might be, I pray you would be as kind as to return the papers I enclose.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Time must be of immense importance to me. Is it not so?</p>
<p>I might say that as soon as God helps, I should be happy to return any money I might be helped with; but, of course, I do not ask you to lend me money; for I know if you help, you help.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be | Professor Darwin | your most thankful servant | and pupil | S. M. Herzfeld | Doctor etc </p>
