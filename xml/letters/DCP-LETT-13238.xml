<p>I am just doing, what I have rarely if ever done before—reading a book through a second time immediately after the first perusal. I do not think I have ever been so attracted by a book,—with perhaps the exceptions of your <hi rend="underline">Origin of Species</hi> and Spencer’s “First Principles” and <hi rend="underline">Social Statics</hi>”.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I wish therefore to call your attention to it, in case you care about books on Social &amp; Political subjects, but here there is also an elaborate discussion of <hi rend="underline">Malthus’ Principals</hi> of <hi rend="underline">Population</hi> to which both you and I have acknowledged ourselves indebted.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The present writer—Mr. George, while admitting the main principle as self-evident and as actually operating in the case of animals and plants, denies that it ever has operated or can operate in the case of man, still less that it has any bearing whatever on the vast social and political questions which have been supported by a reference to it. He illustrates and supports his views with a wealth of illustrative facts and a cogency of argument which I have rarely seen equalled, while his style is equal to that of Buckle &amp; thus his book is delightful reading.</p> <p>The title of the book is—“<hi rend="underline">Progress and Poverty</hi>”. It has gone through 6 editions in America and is now published in England by Kegan Paul.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It is devoted mainly to a brilliant discussion and refutation of some of the most widely accepted maxims of Political Economy—such as the relation of Wages and Capital—the nature of Rents and Interest—the Laws of Distribution &amp;c. but all treated as parts of the main problem as stated in the titlepage—“An Enquiry into the cause of Industrial Depressions and of Increase of <hi rend="underline">want</hi> with increase of <hi rend="underline">Wealth</hi>.” It is the most startlingly novel and original book of the last 20 years and if I mistake not will in the future rank as making an advance in Political and Social Science equal to that made by Adam Smith a century ago.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am here settled in my little cottage engaged in the occupation I most enjoy—making a garden, and admiring the infinite variety and beauty of vegetable life.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I am out of doors all day &amp; hardly read any thing. As the long evenings come on I shall get on with my book on the “<hi rend="underline">Land Question</hi>”, in which I have found a powerful ally in Mr. George.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Hoping you are well | Believe me, | Yours most faithfully | Alfred R. Wallace <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

In the context of this letter, Wallace was probably most interested in chapter 9, ‘The right to the use of the earth’ (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6492.xml">Raby 2001</ref>, p. 228). <hi rend="italic">First principles</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7366.xml">Spencer 1860–2</ref>) argued for the existence of a universal progress towards greater complexity and heterogeneity.</note>

He cited Malthus in his <hi rend="italic">Malay archipelago</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8101.xml">Wallace 1869</ref>, 1: 141). CD cited Malthus in C.

Wallace met George in 1881 when George was in Britain (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6492.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Raby 2001</ref>, p. 229). Wallace published his book <hi rend="italic">Land nationalisation</hi> in 1882 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9825.xml">Wallace 1882</ref>).
