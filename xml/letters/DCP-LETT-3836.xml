<p>I am going out to be Captain of the Forte Flagship to Admiral Warren on the E. Coast of S. America, and You think there is anything I can do for You in the fossil way I shall be happy to do it if you will tell me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Sulivan was telling me that there is a bed of fossil bones at the Gallegos which he wished to examine but had not an opportunity, if any small vessel of the squadron should be going down there I may be able to procure some if You think them worth having—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I should be much obliged if You would tell me the right name of those fine birds which are found in Patagonia something like a guinea fowl, of which I shot the only specimen obtained, and only preserved the head and legs.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> A large landed proprietor in Sussex who has a large enclosed tract of heath has promised to endeavour to naturalize them if I will send some over which I shall endeavour to do, and as a lady who formerly lived at Montevideo told me that she kept some tame and that they did well I hope to get them home alive. I hope your indisposition was only temporary the night we passed at your house, but I was sorry to leave you poorly after passing such a pleasant evening.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I saw Admiral FitzRoy on Friday, who was finishing his book as he told me, and looked worn as if he had been closely confined to his work.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I leave England in a few days and if you think it worth while to write I shall be here until Thursday—</p>
<p>Hoping some day to meet you again I am my dear Darwin with compliments to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin, Yours very truly | A. Mellersh</p>
