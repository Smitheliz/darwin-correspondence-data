            <p>Profoundly sorry for Lane.</p>
            <p>Thanks WDF for facts about call ducks, pigs, and Leicester sheep.</p>
            <p>Has been observing and experimenting on the construction of bees’ cells. Thinks he has a theory which simplifies the problem.</p>
            <p>Scarlet fever in family; nurse ill.</p>

<p>I am extremely glad to hear the view you take of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lane’s case.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> What extraordinary facts you tell me. The soul of some great physician has transmi-grated into you. I am profoundly sorry for D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. L. &amp; all his family, to whom I am much attached.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>We shall, indeed, be delighted to see you here if you can anyhow come.—</p>
<p>Your fact about Call-Ducks is <hi rend="underline">first-rate</hi> for me, &amp; I will quote it; as I particularly wanted such cases of influence of parent, independently of instinct.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>The Sow-case would have been valuable, had it been more recent, so that I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have ascertained, that the same cheek was affected in young, &amp; had known how many young pigs had same deficiency. I have generally been inclined to account for the several similar reported cases by coincidence &amp; inaccuracy, or from <hi rend="underline">disease</hi> of bone having been set up. As the sow was actually pregnant such case does utterly stagger me.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I had heard something of the Leicester sheep &amp; am very glad to have more details: my doubt is, whether in all kinds of sheep black are not sometimes dropped.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I thank you much for all the very kind trouble, which you have taken to get me information on all the above points; and about Horses. I have lately seen some splendid cases of barred legs; but I never can find out about colour of parents.— I hardly know what roan is.— I shall be very glad to hear about young Turkeys, if you succeed;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> but in 3 out of 4 of my experiments, something, which one had not calculated on, interferes with the result.—</p>
<p>I have lately been observing &amp; experimentising with much care on the construction of Bees’ cells &amp; have been testing the accuracy of Huber’s observation &amp; on some points I do not think the blind man’s observations stand the test very well.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I think I have got theory, which greatly simplifies the marvellous power of construction of all the wondrous angles &amp; perfect cell.—</p>
<p>You will be sorry to hear that we have had Etty most seriously ill with a modified form of that horrid new complaint, Diptheria; but all danger is over &amp; she is slowly recovering.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> We have the Baby, also, very ill with fever, but the Doctor declares not dangerously; We have been much terrified as Scarlet Fever has been very bad. Our nurse, too, has sickened, so we have had much trouble, but I hope things are now clearing.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Yours affectionately | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Since this written our Baby has become suddenly most ill.— it is Scarlet Fever, &amp; the Doctor can only say there is yet some hope.</p>
