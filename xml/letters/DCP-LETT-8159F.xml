<p>Many years ago I wrote a paper showing that stones laid on a grass field gradually become completely covered up by worm castings. I am now resuming the subject and making more accurate observations, as I believe they will bear on the denudation of the land.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> You will remember the appearance of lawns, fields, and commons in England, especially during the autumn. Now I want much to know whether in India worms eject their castings on the surface in like manner.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> A surface which is continually dug is not good for observation, but I suppose you could find some neglected part of the garden which you could observe. I find here abundant castings even in rather thick woods. If there are such castings, I should like to know whether they are numerous, and whether they are larger or smaller than those in England. If you could spare the time I should be very glad to hear how any two or three fresh castings marked by you disappeared. <hi rend="underline">Does the heavy tropical rain wash them quickly away?</hi> The heavy rain in England causes a <hi rend="underline">fresh</hi> casting to subside into a disk which will flow an inch or so down a slope. If they once get dry they endure for a surprising time, crumble into pellets, with part washed away and the remainder covered by growing grass. If these trifling observations would not trouble you, I should be really obliged. If you watch any fresh castings, you would have to enclose with stakes or somehow the spot, so that no one might trample them down.</p>
<p>My Dear Sir, yours very sincerely, | Ch. Darwin.</p>
<p>I wrote to you a month or two ago.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">N.B.</hi>—I have not yet been able to ascertain whether the castings on a sandy soil ever disintegrate into dust or powder, so that they can be blown away.</p>
<p>Have you ever observed how deep worms burrow in India?</p>
