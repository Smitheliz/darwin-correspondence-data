                    <salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I was waiting for one of my correspondents on the statistics of size and sex, who has still to be forthcoming—but am glad meanwhile of the opportunity afforded by your note of the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I shall carefully attend to the point raised in that note. Today there is only time (before post) to forward one or two further memoranda on the previous points—including a letter from one of my principal correspondents, which may be of more service in the end than anything else. It is from “John Wright, Esq<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. of Yeldersley House, n<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Derby”—a man of £90,000 a year (no small qualification) and a most enthusiastic and skilful breeder of horses and cattle as well as Scotch Deerhounds—who goes over the world and spares no money nor trouble in the matter, and is immeasurably better worth your notice than I am (for general experience and opportunities of information.) I send his letter entire, in order to give its full impression—and you will see that he wishes to be employed by you.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He has not answered <hi rend="underline">me</hi> as the statistics of <hi rend="underline">births</hi>—but had already done so as to relative size of deerhounds (which I copy elsewhere from a previous letter.)<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He would, I have no doubt, exert himself in the cause—he has every facility—and he has evidently been in the habit of keeping careful notes with a breeder’s view—which I have not hitherto done and know nothing of other animals except at second-hand. I therefore hope, on the one hand for his satisfaction, on the other for your probable advantage, that you will think it worthwhile to send him queries, directly addressed to himself. He is a man in the prime of life and activity—gentlemanly and intelligent. (connected, I believe, with some large banking firm—or rather, a member of a family so connected.)</p>
<p>In regard to the anecdote of the English terrier, you may depend perfectly on it as authentic.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I knew the dog— she died about 12 or 13 years old—never had pups—belonged to my wife’s maternal uncle, who died lately.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The <hi rend="underline">retriever</hi> in question belonged to a next-door neighbour, was kept chained in a kennel in the adjacent garden, while the bitch was from 1 to 3 years old—and she used to go in beside him, sometimes having to be dragged out. Whether or not there were actual attempts at copulation, I cannot say, except from her master’s general impression afterwards stated to me—when referring to the fact of her never breeding. This latter fact was the more brought forward, as she was a remarkably good specimen of the purebred English terrier—<hi rend="underline">wonderfully</hi> <hi rend="underline">intelligent</hi>—and her original proprietor had stipulated that she should be sent back to him, to be put to a dog of her own breed. This was done subsequently, and she attacked the terrier fiercely, so as to prevent anything of the kind (an uncommon thing, so far as I know, though it <hi rend="underline">might</hi> happen from other causes, perhaps, than individual preference.) Afterwards her habit was, when followed by dogs, either to run home or get her master to take her up in his arms. She lived in Edinburgh, it should be observed—and her master’s daily walk was to the Register House in the thick of the town, whither she regularly followed him, unless purposely shut up or thus driven home to refuge.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> So much for poor little “Corra”—whose case, so far as it goes, may be relied upon.</p>
<p>I was struck by the fact of <hi rend="underline">Mayhew’s</hi> coincidence with this case and my own bitch’s—especially as I had not read his remarks till I wrote to you.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>On second thoughts I retain my other notes for the present—being late for post, and confining myself to Mr Wright’s letter. It need not be returned at present— <hi rend="underline">afterwards</hi> will do.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Of the <hi rend="underline">deerhound puppy</hi> question more anon.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Pray believe me truly yours | George Cupples</p>
<p>P.S. | I shall weigh the <hi rend="underline">Dog-pups</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">bitch-pups</hi> every week—and record the results during any period desirable   I have at present 10 pups <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
