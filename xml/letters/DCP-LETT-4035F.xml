<p>I had a talk with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Atherley today before he went off. it turns out to be a mistake, &amp; that he has no wish to give up.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I asked whether he had any real thought or wish to sell, and said that it would be better for me if it was done now rather than 5 or 6 years hence.</p>
<p>And he said positively that he had not any wish and that he merely mentioned it in the same way that he always mentioned anything about the bank affairs. he said that if this had turned up when he was looking about for a partner he thought he probably should have seen what they offered, and very likely has sold it; but that now he was very comfortable as he was, and had not wish to get out of it.</p>
<p>but he said if I did not like the business or had a very strong wish to sell out he would see what they offered.</p>
                    <p>Of course I could not say I had a strong wish to sell out, or had a dislike to the business, so that when he asked me, I said I was very well satisfied; and did not wish for a change. he afterwards said that he had doubts whether the Company had the money to give us supposing they wished to buy us out. he then said that supposing he had had a wish to get rid of the business, he should not have thought of mentioning the subject or make a proposal without I made the proposal first, or shewed myself willing, as he should consider it most unfair upon me and quite contrary to his idea of partnership; and that I might rely upon it that he would never in any way throw me over. he also said something about his dying in harness, &amp; not being better off with nothing to do; as work had become a habit to him   My idea is that Mr Atherley would like it, and that he every now and then feels from being in low spirits that he should like to be free to go off anywhere; but at the same time he feels that his life would not be so comfortable with nothing to do.</p>
<p>And that if I have expressed a strong wish either way, it would have settled him, or helped him to make up his mind as to what he wished. I think this is all too strong, but I should think he felt something of this kind. he is very fond of his work; and takes great interest in everything and works most heartily.</p>
<p>Supposing I had made up my mind that it would be better for me to come out of this with 6 or 7 thousand, I think I hardly could make the proposition after what he has said. What do you think? If anything more turns up I will write.</p>
