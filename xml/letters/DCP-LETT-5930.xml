<p>Will forward LR’s memoir to Earl of Tankerville. Has sent LR’s pamphlet on "Darwin Lehre" [<hi rend="italic">Die Grenzen der Thierwelt</hi> (1868)] to a German lady he employs as a translator. Cannot agree that there is an innate principle of perfection.</p>

<p>I am very glad that you have sent to England your memoir for the Earl of Tankerville. He is so much interested about his wild Cattle that I do not doubt he will like to have a copy in his library.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> As soon as I receive it from Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Williams,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I will forward it to him. You say that you have added a pamphlet “zur Darwin lehre”; but I received a copy of this 2 or 3 weeks ago.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have been very tardy in thanking you for it &amp; for your Herkunft unserer Thierwelt, &amp; for your Nat. Geschichte des Rindes.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> All of which I owe to your great kindness. My only excuse is that I have lately been much engaged.</p>
<p>As there is no man in Europe whose opinion on the modification of species I value more than yours, I was extremely anxious to read your pamphlet. But your style is very difficult for me to understand, so that I despatched it immediately to a young German lady whom I sometimes employ to translate for me, &amp; as she has not much spare time, I do not suppose I shall receive the translation for a month, when I shall read it <hi rend="underline">eagerly</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am very sorry to disagree with you on any point, but I cannot agree that there is any innate principle of progressive perfection;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> it seems to me that this will inevitably follow from natural selection.</p>
<p>With sincere thanks for all your kindness believe me | my dear Sir | yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">No letter from Rütimeyer to CD on this subject has been found. CD refers to Rütimeyer’s two-part monograph on the natural history of cattle; Rütimeyer discussed an ancient breed, the Chillingham cattle, that lived on the estate of Charles August Bennet, sixth earl of Tankerville (Rütimeyer 1867a, p. 54, and Rütimeyer 1867b, pp. 130–3, 146–9). Rütimeyer’s description of the breed was based on a skull obtained from Tankerville by CD (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 13, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4736.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Ludwig Rütimeyer, 3 January 1865</ref>).

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">This comment on the progressive principle of development was evidently in the missing letter from Rütimeyer.</note>
