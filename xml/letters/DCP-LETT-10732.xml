<p>I have undertaken to answer your kind letter &amp; to give you all the news I can.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>My husband is much pleased that you were interested in his book.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The experiments are so minutely described that he thinks some skipping is very necessary for most of his books.</p>
<p>The Teesdales have been settled for 2 or 3 months &amp; have furnished Down Hall most comfortably &amp; sumptuously. They seem to be very agreeable people with pretty &amp; cultivated daughters.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> (In order to shew how severe our weather has been I may mention that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Teesdale went to Orpington for 10 days on a sledge).</p>
<p>The great event last week was the opening of a Reading Room, when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nash gave a good supper to whoever chose to come &amp; I was not surprized to hear that he had 90 guests. They have hired George Wood’s old house for the purpose &amp; begin the world with 45 members.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Of course they will not nearly pay their way; which one would have preferred. We have also a band of Hope under M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Nash’s superintendence which is of course prosperous at present, while the children are young &amp; have no temptation; but I have some hopes that the effect may remain with some, especially of the girls, after they are grown up.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Both these undertakings are thorns in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ffinden’s side &amp; he has not been content with holding aloof from them; but has used all his influence to prevent their succeeding.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin is pretty well &amp; hard at work with his secretary (Frank)  Leonard is stationed at Malta with the engineers, &amp; George who has been an invalid for some years is going to join him there in a week’s time.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Will you give my kind love to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Innes &amp; tell her I hope we shall see you &amp; her when you come South as I am glad to hear you are intending, &amp; with my kind remembrances to your son &amp; with every good wish to your trio,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> very truly yours | Emma Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. As a proof that nobody need despair I will tell you that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horsman has a curacy in Kent, &amp; is rash enough to talk of his “friends the Lubbocks”.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I have omitted poor M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thompson, whose fate is very melancholy. He is said to be slowly affected by the creeping palsy, which is quite a hopeless malady.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>C. desires me to say that both your facts are quite new to him &amp; surprize him much.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
