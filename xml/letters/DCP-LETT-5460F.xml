<p>I send you one of the most delightful inventions of the age, going by the name of a Cardigan Jacket.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I find it most comfortable over one’s waistcoat when riding or travelling. I should think it would save you the agony of having to put on a second flannel waitscoat in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>I am astonished to find how disappointed I am with the D of Argyle; I really can hardly finish it, some of it is the most illogical stupid twaddle I ever read; especially “creation by law” and about the humming bird; he mentions you enough but I believe he does not understand and will not understand the Origin.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> being a Duke has played the deuce with him, he thinks I’m a Duke, and a Duke is just about the finest thing that grows, the creator can’t be very much finer, I use my wonderful &amp; ducal mind in such and such a way to produce certain things, therefore of course the creator does the same Q.E.D.</p>
<p>I hope Horace is going on well.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> | Your affect son | W.E.Darwin</p>

Campbell discussed the plumage of humming-birds, concluding that the variety of colours and forms served no function in the battle for life and could not be explained by any physical law, but must be referred to a creative law that promoted beauty and variety of form (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1188.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Campbell 1867</ref>, pp. 242–9).</note>
