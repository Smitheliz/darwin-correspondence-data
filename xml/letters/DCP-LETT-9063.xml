            <p>Thanks for C. E. Norton’s address.</p> 
<p>Tyndall’s answer [<hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> 8 (1873): 399] has surprised and disappointed him;</p> 
            <p>great trouble in announcing Tyndall’s election as President Elect [of BAAS] yesterday. Tyndall may throw up the Presidency. Spottiswoode and JDH have concocted a letter telling him the facts.</p> 
<p>A very poor dull meeting. Comments on papers by W. C. Williamson, Clerk Maxwell, David Ferrier, Burdon Sanderson [<hi rend="italic">Rep. BAAS</hi> 43: lxx–xci, 23–32,126–7, 131–3].</p> 
            <p>Has heard Huxley is back quite well.</p>

<p>Thanks for Nortons address<ref target="#foot.f2"/>   I wanted it to introduce a friend who I think Nortons would like to know.</p>
<p>I am distressed to hear of your continued badness.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I shall be delighted to go to Down by usual train on Saturday week— Earlier if you like.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mimosa albida</hi> I will see to on my return— meanwhile I hope for seeds of more sensitive kind.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Tyndalls answer has surprized &amp; disappointed me greatly &amp; much vexed all his friends here   He quotes at the end a passage in a letter from me in which deplored such correspondence &amp; blamed “Nature” for inserting them! my letter was addressed to him under the idea that he was on the continent &amp; was intended to sooth any irritation that might lead to a counter-explosion—&amp; miserably I have failed.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It required great tact in announcing his Election as Pres. Elect yesterday— &amp; prevented my seconding it as was prepared to do, with a special allusion to Tyndall’s appreciation of his predecessors labor— Of course this became impossible—&amp; the proposal by Henry Smith &amp; seconding (by Spottiswode) were pronounced by all to be unusually <hi rend="italic">[</hi>tame<hi rend="italic">]</hi> &amp; heartless— yet both I am sure did their very best. H. Smith dilated on his popularity—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> There was a counter propostion by the Mayor of Cork, for D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Andrews to be President, on purely local grounds—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> but it fell to the ground, unsupported by any one but a Belfast Man, who like the Mayor was wholly unscientific— The Cork Scientifics repudiated the attempt with some indignation— but I am not sure but that Tyndall will throw up the Presidency—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Spottiswode &amp; I concocted a letter to him at once, telling him the facts.</p>
<p>This is a very poor meeting indeed. Williamsons address was very poor &amp; badly put together I think.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Dr. Williamsons lecture on Coal fossils was popular, well done &amp; very suitable to non scientifics— but void of any philsophical treatment &amp; wrong in points of Botanical detail<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Clark Maxwells lecture on Molecules last night was simply dull dry &amp; singularly unintellagable as delivered— without a point or significance to the outside world.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Ferriers brain work was intensely interesting but I think that he proves far too much.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Burdon Sandersons paper was capital— it is a grand discovery<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Allman’s address was splendidly done<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>We are very jolly here— in a quiet lodging, (Strachey, Dyer, Lawson)   We go tomorrow to Sir J. K. Shuttleworth near Kirby Lonsdale till Saturday—then back to Kew—<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I have just heard that Huxley is back “quite well”<ref target="#foot.f17"/> &amp; that Sharpy<ref target="#foot.f18"/> has had an apoplectic attack but is better— Strachey says that Georges paper comes off today.<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
