                    <p>The plants arrived last night in first-rate order; &amp; it was <hi rend="underline">very very</hi> good of you to take so much trouble as to hunt them up yourself.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> They seem exactly what I wanted, &amp; if I fail it will not be for want of perfect materials.— But a confounded Painter (I beg his pardon) comes here to night, &amp; for next two days I shall be half dead with sitting to him;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but after then I will begin to work at the plants &amp; see what I can do, &amp; very curious I am about the results.—</p>
                    <p>I have to thank you for two very interesting letters. I am delighted to hear &amp; with surprise that you care about old Erasmus D.— God only knows what I shall make of his life,—it is such new kind of work to me.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Thanks for case of sleeping Crotalaria—new to me.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>I quite agree to every word which you say about Ball’s Lecture— it is as you say like Sir W. Thompson’s meteorite— It is really a pity— it is enough to make geographical Distribution ridiculous in the eyes of the world.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Frank will be interested about the Auriculas: I never attended to this plant, for the powder did seem to me like true “bloom”.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>This subject, however, <hi rend="underline">for the present</hi> only, has gone to the dogs with me.—</p>
                    <p>I am sorry to hear of such a struggle for existence at Kew; but I have often wondered how it is that you are all not killed outright.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>I can most fully sympathise with you in your admiration of your little girl.— There is nothing so charming in this world, &amp; we all in this house humbly adore our grandchild, &amp; think his little pimple of a nose quite beautiful<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>with hearty thanks, yours very sincerely Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Thiselton-Dyer had sent several species of plants with aerial roots for CD’s research on their tropic movements (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12086.xml">letter to W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, 5 June 1879</ref> and n. 2). </note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The only extant letter from Thiselton-Dyer at this time is his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12099.xml">letter of 10 June 1879</ref>, which is incomplete. In that letter, Thiselton-Dyer promised to write again when he sent the plants with aerial roots, but that letter has not been found. The incomplete letter or the missing letter evidently contained Thiselton-Dyer’s comments on CD’s research on his grandfather <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1219.xml">Erasmus Darwin</ref>.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Part of the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12099.xml">letter of 10 June 1879</ref>, in which Thiselton-Dyer discussed <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_261.xml">John Ball</ref>’s paper on the origin of alpine flora (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10815.xml">Ball 1879</ref>), is missing. Ball had argued that flowering plants first evolved in alpine regions and challenged the theory of glacial migration that was part of CD’s theory of geographical distribution (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 367–70). Thiselton-Dyer had evidently referred to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4737.xml">William Thomson</ref>’s theory that the sun’s energy was continually topped up by meteors and asteroids falling into it at a regular rate (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7738.xml">W. Thomson 1862</ref>). Thomson’s suggestion that life on earth could have originated from meteorites had also been heavily criticised (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7741.xml">W. Thomson 1871</ref>, pp. civ–cv; see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 19, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-7896.xml">letter from J. D. Hooker, 5 August 1871</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Thiselton-Dyer had sent CD an extract about the meal or farina found on many varieties of auricula (<hi rend="italic">Primula auricula</hi>; see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12099.xml">letter from W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, 10 June 1879</ref> and n. 3).</note>
