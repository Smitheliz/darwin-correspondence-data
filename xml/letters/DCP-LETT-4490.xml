            <p>On the Borneo cave exploration.</p>
            <p>ARW will send his contribution to theory of origin of man. The vast mental and cranial differences between man and apes, whereas structural differences in other parts of body are small. The problem of explaining diversity of human races along with the stability of man’s form during all historical epochs. Discussion with "Anthropologicals" [following reading of ARW’s paper, "The origin of human races", before the Anthropological Society, 1 Mar 1864].</p>

<p>The Borneo Cave exploration is to go on at present without a subscription.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The New British Consul<ref target="#foot.f3"/> who is going out to Sarawak this month will undertake to explore some of the caves nearest the town, &amp; if any thing of interest is obtained a good large sum can no doubt be raised for a thorough exploration of the whole country.— Sir J. Brooke will give every assistance &amp; will supply men for the preliminary work.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I send you now my little contribution to the <hi rend="underline">theory</hi> of the origin of man—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I hope you will be able to agree with me— If you are able I shall be glad to have your criticisms. I was led to the subject by the necessity of explaining the vast mental &amp; cranial differences between man &amp; the apes combined with such small structural differences in other parts of the body,—&amp; also by an endeavour to account for the diversity of human races combined with man’s almost perfect stability of form during all historical epochs—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It has given me a settled opinion on these subjects, if nobody can shew a fallacy in the argument.</p>
<p>The Anthropologicals did not seem to appreciate it much, but we had a long discussion which appears almost verbatim in the “Anthropolog. Review”.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>As the Linnæan Transactions will not be out till the end of the year I sent a pretty full abstract of the more interesting parts of my <hi rend="underline">Papilionidæ</hi> paper to the “Reader”<ref target="#foot.f8"/> which as you say is a splendid paper—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Wallace’s paper, ‘The origin of human races and the antiquity of man deduced from the theory of “natural selection” ’ (Wallace 1864b), was read at a meeting of the Anthropological Society of London on 1 March 1864. A copy inscribed by Wallace, and heavily annotated by CD, is in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL. The article in CD’s unbound copy of <hi rend="italic">Anthropological Review</hi>, in the Darwin Archive–CUL, is also annotated. An abstract of the article including some changes in content from the original article appeared in the July 1864 issue of the <hi rend="italic">Natural History Review</hi> (see Wallace 1864c and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4514.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from A. R. Wallace, 29 May [1864]</ref>); CD’s unbound copy of the journal containing this abstract is also in the Darwin Archive–CUL.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">In Wallace 1864b, Wallace argued that as humans began manipulating their environment through the use of tools, fire, and agriculture, while also developing co-operative social groups that protected the weak, natural selection no longer acted upon most of the human form; only the intellectual and moral faculties were affected, in addition to the shape and size of the cranium. Though in these respects humans diverged from the anthropoid apes, the rest of the human body retained ape-like structures. Wallace proposed that a single, initially homogeneous race, similar to modern humans in form, ‘but with mental faculties scarcely raised above the brute’, dispersed to new, extreme environments where the different groups developed particular physical racial characteristics (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. clxvi). His argument that humans originated in the Eocene or Miocene periods, earlier than previously suggested, allowed time for this dispersal, for the continued natural selection of favourable mental and moral variations, and for the perceived long period of stability during which physical racial differences remained fixed (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4514.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from A. R. Wallace, 29 May [1864]</ref> and n. 19). Wallace believed his position explained the ‘wonderful persistence of mere physical characteristics, which is the stumbling-block of those who advocate the unity of mankind’ (Wallace 1864b, p. clxvi). In a note at the end of Wallace 1864b, p. clxx, Wallace wrote that the general idea and argument of his paper were new, but that the ‘perusal of Mr. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4495.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Herbert Spencer’s</ref> works, especially <hi rend="italic">Social Statics</hi>’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7361.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Spencer 1851</ref>) had suggested them to him, and had also furnished him ‘with some of the applications’ (see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4378.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from A. R. Wallace, 2 January 1864</ref> and nn. 16–24). For Wallace on human origins, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4461.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Kottler 1974</ref>, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2215.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Durant 1979</ref>, pp. 40–51, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2502.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Fichman 1981</ref>, pp. 99–121, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6628.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">R. J. Richards 1987</ref>, pp. 162–66 and 176–86.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The discussion following the presentation of Wallace’s paper was printed in the <hi rend="italic">Anthropological Review</hi>, pp. clxx–clxxxvii. Though two speakers praised Wallace’s paper, the others were critical, including the president, James Hunt, who attacked Wallace’s statement that humans must have sprung from one race. Many of the members of the Anthropological Society of London favoured what was then called polygenism, the belief that the human races originated separately; they also tended to oppose the theory CD expressed in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4404.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 9 [March] 1864</ref> and n. 23, and Wallace 1864c, p. 329). By upholding the long existence of different races, Wallace’s paper attempted to reconcile the polygenists’ point of view with that of the monogenists, who believed that humans had originated as a single race (see n. 6, above). CD’s copy of the discussion, in his unbound issue of the <hi rend="italic">Anthropological Review</hi>, is not annotated. For CD’s later discussion of monogenism and polygenism, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 1: 228–35.
