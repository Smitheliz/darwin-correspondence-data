According to L. Huxley ed. 1918, 1: 350, in September, when the Hookers were in the process of moving, onerous conditions imposed by the government caused them to give up the house.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Of his work as editor of the exhibition reports, Hooker wrote that it was ‘a great bore in some cases and very easy in others; there will be 1600 pages of it’ (L. Huxley ed. 1918, 1: 365). The reports when published came to a total of 749 pages (<hi rend="italic">Exhibition of the</hi> <hi rend="italic">works of industry of all nations, 1851.

Entries on 8 June 1845 and 15 November 1851 in CD’s reading notebook record his reading of this work, which he considered ‘poor’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Appendix IV, 119: 16a, 23b).</note>

CD’s earlier interest in crosses between salmon and trout (<hi rend="italic">Salmo ferox</hi> is a lake trout) is exhibited in some scraps relating to fish and hybridisation preserved in DAR 205.7 (letters): 283–4. The first, cut from a letter bearing a mourning border, asks: ‘Are the statements of hybrid fishes in the Phil. Trans for 1771 [J. R. Forster 1771, pp. 318–19] to be depended on?—’. The correspondent has not been identified, and it is possible that the letter was not addressed to CD but was passed on to him. The verso bears the following: ‘deposit with me a copy of his entire work to be presented, “when it passes out of my hands, to the Library 〈    〉 establishment. So great a’. This has been deleted in ink. Pinned to this fragment are two notes written in pencil by CD. The first reads: ‘Believes he has seen many mule fish—between trout &amp; salmon.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Knight. Phil. Trans. 1828. p. 319’. <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4407.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Knight 1828</ref>, p. 322, states that: <quote> I have never possessed means of obtaining mule fishes; but one kind of fish, which I think is obviously a mule, is found in many rivers where the common river-trout abounds, and where a solitary salmon is sometimes seen. These formerly existed, in some seasons, in considerable numbers, in the river which passes near my residence; but since salmon have become scarce, they have wholly disappeared. I had formerly opportunities of examining a large number of them, without having ever found a single female … They are readily distinguished from the young salmon, by their form being intermediate between that of a trout and of a salmon; by their being all, or nearly all, males; and by their remaining through the summer and autumn in the rivers, long after the young salmon have descended to the sea: they leave the fresh water with the first winter floods, and I believe are not known ever to return … If these be mules, as I do not entertain any doubt that they are, the spawn of fishes must be without sex when it is deposited by the female</quote> The second note by CD reads: (<hi rend="italic">recto</hi>) ‘Walker [probably Walker 1803a and 1803b, published in <hi rend="italic">Prize Essays and Transactions of the Highland Society of Scotland</hi>]’; (<hi rend="italic">verso</hi>) ‘N Q | Scropes Days of Salmon Fishing p. 34 M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Shaw crossed Trout &amp; Salmon [<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7042.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Scrope 1843</ref>, p. 34, refers to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7143.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Shaw 1840</ref> and correspondence with John Shaw on the crossing of trout and salmon]’. CD recorded having read the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> of 1788 to 1840 on 1 March 1840, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7042.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Scrope 1843</ref> on 7 October 1844, and the second volume (1803) of the <hi rend="italic">Prize Essays and</hi> <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Highland Society of Scotland</hi> in May 1845 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Appendix IV, 119: 7a, 14a, 15a). CD also recorded in his reading notebook (DAR 119) that he had made an abstract of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7042.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Scrope 1843</ref>. This abstract is not with CD’s abstracts of scientific books (DAR 71 and 72), and the scrap preserved in DAR 205.7 (Letters) relating to Scrope’s work may have been cut from the abstract.</note>
