<p>I will not allow even the fraction of a post-day to pass without responding at once to your very friendly letter by saying how pleased I am to learn that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Huxley would be likely to accept the reversion of this little estate with genuine satisfaction.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It is likewise a genuine satisfaction to myself to think that after I have retired from its overlordship it will come under the ownership of such a worthy successor—one, to whom I have long felt manifold obligations for the intellectual advantages I have received at his hands, and whom I have so long honoured &amp; esteemed for the noble and independent spirit with which he has had the courage to support his own convictions, popular, or unpopular, as they might be. I can remember but too well the howl that went up from pulpit and platform when the “Origin of Species” first came out, and long after that; and I do half imagine that your grand scientific work might have been damped down and stifled for a good many years if a few bold and able men had not fallen into the ranks, as supports, behind you: Amongst these I should suppose that Professor Huxley stood foremost—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> — When I wrote I fancied that you would probably see him again in London; and thought that you would communicate to him what I had written to you, as I did not wish to make any secret of it. But I now quite understand your delicacy on that point. As you feel sure that it would form an agreeable announcement to him, and not a displeasing task to yourself as an old friend of his, and I am but an indifferent artist in getting up a formal letter—if you will take that duty upon yourself it will be doing me a good turn—and a pleasant mode, I am sure, of conveying the intelligence to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. H—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Then, you see, at any time when he could spare the time, he could come down to make an inspection of the premises, and have a talk with me over them, that would be pleasant &amp; useful— Since you were here I have added a couple of rooms—good servants rooms, which enable one to have without much, scarcely any, alteration, 3 good principal bed rooms, 1. small one. 1 dressing room for the master;—kitchen, and house keeper’s room below, with 2 bed rooms for servants off the back stairs. Thus with trifling additions this might be well enough adapted for the occupation of a small family.—</p>
                    <p>Just informed that the boy is waiting for letters; and that will spare you the chance of having to spell through another sheet.—</p>
                    <p>Delighted to hear that there is still a chance of my seeing M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin &amp; yourself this summer: My compliments to her doubly accentuated; and good regards with many thanks to yourself from | Dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin | Yours very truly | Anthony Rich</p>
