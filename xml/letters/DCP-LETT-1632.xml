<p>It is not singular that the Blood-Discs of different genera of birds should be similar, for widely distinct Families have those corpuscles not distinguishable in size, shape, or structure. <anchor xml:id="ann.a1" type="annotationStart"/>When a marked difference of shape occurs it seems to be merely aberrant, as in the Snowy Owl, Passenger Pigeon,<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> Snow-Bunting, Great Butcher Bird, Java Sparrow, &amp;c. And so of certain saurian Reptiles. In my Appendix to Gerber’s Anatomy, 8<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. Lond. 1842,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> where the details are fuller than in the Notes to Hewson.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Indeed, the difference of the corpuscles in the entire class of Birds is not more than may be found in a single Family of Mammals.</p>
<p>All I recollect of the cows and goats that I examined is, that they were those most easily got at in London, &amp; therefore probably the most common ones.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>The measurements of the Dog’s corpuscles 13542<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, of the Dingo 13395<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, &amp; of the Wolf 13600<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of an inch,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> seem much more different in figures than in fact, and no greater than might be obtained by reducing the averages of different sets of measurements of the corpuscles of the very same individual, provided the measurements were not confined to a single dried &amp; invariable specimen of blood.</p>
<p>The measurement in the Dog in Hewson was from a little mongrel. <anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>I have examined those of a fox-hound and of other good breeds without noting any marked difference.<anchor xml:id="ann.a4" type="annotationEnd"/> But the corpuscles of the Fox, after many comparative trials, have always proved <hi rend="underline">very slightly smaller</hi> than the corpuscles of the Dog.</p>
<p>I am, | Yours very truly, | George Gulliver.</p>
<p>If you want to see a marked difference of size in the corpuscles of a single family of mammals, compare the comparatively minute corpuscles of the smallest Ruminants or Rodents with the larger corpuscles of the largest species of the same order.</p>
