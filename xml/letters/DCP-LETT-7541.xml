<p>What you say about the tools and arms looks most probable: and <hi rend="underline">may</hi> also apply to canoes huts &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Would it apply to food—captured animals &amp;c? But it would scarcely apply to the principal personal property of savages—<hi rend="underline">cattle</hi>—which in a nomad &amp; wild country are essentially communal. There is even a trace of it still in the common village dairies of the Swiss Alps. And if our own law is any test a developed law of personal property is a much later thing than a law of real property.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>But a point in Maine’s book<ref target="#foot.f3"/> which struck me particularly, was the late and modern character of rights of the individual person not only in respect of property but in all ways. The Patriarch, or the Chieftain of the Scotch or Irish clan, had almost absolute power over its members—not because he was the strongest or most selfish—but because he represented, defended, fed and managed for the community. This power was given a prominent place in civilized law by the Patria Potestas of the Romans. And the relics of it remain with us in the legends of <hi rend="underline">legal</hi> wife-selling, &amp; wife-beating; in the form of action by which a father recovers damages for the seduction of a daughter, as for the loss of her services—and in the common law inability of a married woman to hold property— There was an exceedingly interesting speech by Jessel illustrating this in the debates on the married womens property Bill.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>In short it seems from the history of law as if the earliest thing regarded was the community or the family; &amp; the last thing the individual person.</p>
<p>Forgive this long yarn—&amp; dont answer—but enjoy Down &amp; quiet in peace</p>
<p>Sincerely yours | T H Farrer</p>
<p>I must add one thing from my own special shop.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am satisfied that the earliest form of law or custom concerning Ships &amp; property in Ships was one in which the Ship was regarded as an integral thing owned &amp; worked in common by all who belonged to her, so that all took a share in the risks and a share in the profits.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence of this in the old laws, and there are certain rudiments which have been only cut out of our own law in my time—such as “Freight the mother of wages”,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp;c, which become explicable on the above supposition &amp; I think on no other</p>

When the Roman law became that of a civilized people, the position of the wife was altogether changed.
