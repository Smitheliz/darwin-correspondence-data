<p rend="centre"><hi rend="underline">South West Pacific</hi></p> 
<p><hi rend="underline">Niua-fu</hi> or Good Hope Island which I presume to be the same as that Onouafu in “Coral Reefs” is entirely volcanic and has no reef whatever.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The shores are steep to. There is a salt water lake about 6 miles in circumference connected with the sea by a very narrow stream. The island is about 500 feet high. There are several craters and I was informed that some had very recently been in a state of activity. (June 1872)</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Wallis Island</hi> is encircled. There are 11 islands, 7 of which are on the outer reef. Its native name is Uea<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Horn Islands</hi> comprising Fotuna and Alofa each have a distinct fringing reef. Fotuna is about 2500 feet and Alofa 1200 feet high.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I can give you no information regarding the depth of water except that there is a deep ship channel between the islands no soundings being obtainable with the hand line. The channel is barely a mile broad.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mitchell Island</hi> to the south of the Ellice Group is a very low atoll with about 10 small islands on the reef.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> We were unable to discover any entrance into the lagoon</p>
<p>“<hi rend="underline">Grand Cocal</hi> was searched for in vain by HMS Basilisk and as all the local traders deny its existence, I cannot think it exists. It has long been marked doubtful on the Admiralty charts and the description leads me to suppose the island reported to have been S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Augustine<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Sapona</hi> or Edgecumbe Island (Otooboa of Dillon”) has a barrier reef with a four fathom channel through it which leads into a harbour in the island itself.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> There is also deep but uneven water generally inside the reef</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Espiritu Santo</hi> and the <hi rend="underline">Banks’ Islands</hi> have reefs of the fringing kind as also have all the <hi rend="underline">New Hebrides</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Torres Groups</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p> 
<p rend="centre"><hi rend="underline">Indian Ocean</hi></p> 
<p><hi rend="underline">S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Jean de Nova</hi> or Farquhar Islands is an undoubted atoll with 4 large &amp; several smaller islands.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> There is a channel into the lagoon at the N.W. side between the largest island and the Western reef. A coral bank of considerable extent stretches off the southern end of the atoll with 5 fathoms of water on it.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Aldabra</hi> is undoubtedly an upheaved atoll. The account in Horsburgh is very misleading as neither the red cliffs nor high forests were to be found.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> It is entirely composed of coral rock with a fine growth of mangroves enclosing an extensive but shallow lagoon. There is a narrow riband of 9 fathoms water running 3 miles into the lagoon from the N.W. corner.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Great Comoro</hi> is volcanic and about 8600 feet high.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> There is a little fringing reef on the North &amp; S.E. sides</p>
<p>The above islands were surveyed by H.M.S. Fawn last year on an inch scale so that doubtless charts of them will shortly be published by the Admiralty.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>The East Coast of Africa South of Mombas has a fringing reef and is itself composed of coral rock.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> From Wasin to Punganis however there is a barrier of large coral reefs from 2 to 5 miles off shore with a deep channel inside having sometimes as great a depth as 20 fathoms. An Admiralty chart of Tanga Harbour and its approaches has recently been published by the Admiralty which will give a good general idea of the coast in that district.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>

Chambers and Munro 1980</ref>. In 1872, the officers of the <hi rend="italic">Basilisk</hi> searched for Gran Cocal north of Nanumanga, Tuvalu; when they failed to find it, the suggestion arose that the island had been confused with a reported shoal in the area between Nanumanga and Nanumea (St Augustine), Tuvalu (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 189).</note>
