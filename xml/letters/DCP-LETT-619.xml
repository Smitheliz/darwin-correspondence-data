            <p>CD approves of HES’s "laws" [of nomenclature]. Regrets that [J. E.?] Gray does not approve of the scheme. CD has sent the paper to William Ogilby and suggests that HES send it to G. R. Waterhouse, of whom he has a high opinion.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD refers to a printed draft of a committee report to the British Association on the subject of zoological nomenclature eventually published as Strickland <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> 1842. The committee, including both Strickland and CD, had been formally established by the Council of the British Association on 11 February (Strickland <hi rend="italic">et al. </hi> 1842, pp. 105–6). The report generally rejected the practice of would-be reformers and insisted on the rule of priority. It was widely accepted as a standard by zoologists in most countries until the 1890s (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7510.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Stresemann 1975</ref>, pp. 264–7).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD has made comments on the draft. Against the sentence: ‘By emanating from a body [the British Association for the Advancement of Science] which has not improperly been termed the Parliament of Science … ’, CD has written ‘[<hi rend="italic">illeg</hi>] will not foreigners demur.—’. Against the passage: ‘A name may be changed which, from implying a false proposition, is liable to propagate error’, CD has written ‘This appears to me left far too open—all comparatives &amp; many superlatives, as minor, maximus may be changed, when a smaller or larger species is discovered: False geographical names, appear to me almost the only ones which should be changed. C Darwin’. Following this is written, ‘I quite agree with Darwin. L. Jenyns’.</note>
