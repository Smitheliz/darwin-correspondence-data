<p>Your case of the rabbit is a curious one; but there is something very odd about the colours of young rabbits. There are breeds, which are invariably white whilst young &amp; then become almost black; &amp; other breeds which are at first black &amp; then become almost white.— Most of these were aboriginally crossed breeds, &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> suspect that the parents of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Innes-Brodies rabbit were of crossed origin.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Your account of your schools has interested me much, &amp; all the more as on Saturday L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Young, who as L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Advocate introduced your school-boards, was lunching here, &amp; was talking much about the Scotch schools.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He was remarking how odd it was that the voters who taxed themselves now spent very much more in their schools than was formerly done.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He did not know anything about the relative advantages of Scotch &amp; English primary schools.— I have no news whatever to tell you about the neighbourhood, as I see, if that be possible, even fewer people than formerly.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duck, you will have heard, is dead,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; we have had to appoint a new Trustee to the Friendly Club in his place, &amp; the Committee elected M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Pearson.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> By the way here is a wonderful piece of news, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fflinden has forgiven M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pearson, &amp; they are reconciled.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have not been very well of late &amp; have been working too hard in correcting the proofs of another of my everlasting books viz on Insectivorous Plants—which contains hardly anything about evolution.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>We never cease to wish you had not left us.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>My wife desires me to say that the plants of your Aquilegia are doing well, but not nearly so forward as yours.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
