<p>E. S. Galton</p>
                    <p>“As this book gives a false impression of many things, I intend to copy out a letter I wrote to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Dowson on D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Erasmus Darwins life, as he quotes largely from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Schimmelpenninck— E. S. Galton</p>
                    <p>“(Grand-daughter to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Erasmus Darwin &amp; niece of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Schimmelpenninck)<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>“Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1871. to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Dowson of Whitby”</p>
                    <p>“Sir, as recently as last week, having had sent to me a copy of your lecture at Whitby in 1861, on D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Erasmus Darwin, I must apologize for troubling you with this letter.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> As his Grand-daughter, I have been much interested in reading your lecture upon his life and works, and as I see you are preparing a fuller account, I cannot refrain from expressing our satisfaction that you do not agree entirely with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Schimp<hi rend="superscript">k</hi>.— So far from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin being an atheist, I enclose a beautiful poem of his, against atheism.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>“M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Schimp<hi rend="superscript">k</hi>. had the habit of coloring her facts, till they almost ceased to be true—</p>
                    <p>“Her eldest Brother, Samuel Tertius Galton (my Father) married D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Erasmus Darwin’s eldest daughter, by his second wife, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Pole—(who is my Mother)—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>“An unfortunate quarrel between M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Schim<hi rend="superscript">k</hi> &amp; her family, caused a complete cessation of intercourse with them since 1810—and her feelings towards them, which she shewed on various occasions, has evidently influenced her in her description of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin—such as his coarseness and gluttony &amp;c—so <hi rend="underline">very</hi> different from the character given him by her Father, Mother Brothers &amp; Sisters, all of whom had so great a veneration for him—</p>
                    <p>“With respect to her account of the Upas tree Page 207—what may have been said as a joke, between very <hi rend="underline">intimate</hi> friends, I know not, but as a child, I was often told of the Upas tree as a fact, &amp; it has been proved to be true (see M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Somerville’s Molecular Science Vol 1. Page 426)<ref target="#foot.f6"/> M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Schimp<hi rend="superscript">k</hi> was only 24. years of age when D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin died. Her life was not published till after my Father’s death, as she outlived him for 12. years—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>“My Aunt, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Brewin (née Sophia Galton)<ref target="#foot.f8"/> who was only a few years younger than her sister Mary Anne Schimp<hi rend="superscript">k</hi>. made this remark to me, when I asked her opinion as to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Schimp<hi rend="superscript">ks</hi>. life ‘<hi rend="underline">They are facts distorted, &amp; give a false impression</hi>’</p>
                    <p>“I would rather see my Grandfather’s character drawn by his intimate friends—Watt, Boulton, Edgeworth &amp; Wedgewood,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> who were his co-temporaries &amp; knew him, &amp; spoke of him as he was, than from Miss Seward<ref target="#foot.f10"/> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Schimp<hi rend="superscript">k</hi>., who for private reasons speak of him so differently—” “Miss Seward was well known to be much disappointed, at not being the second M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Erasmus Darwin— I well remember my Grandmother M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin, a sensible &amp; agreeable person</p>
                    <p>“At the time Miss Sewards life of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin came out, the family were so angry with the false accounts put in, that my mother says, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Robert Darwin (of Shrewsbury) obliged her to contradict many things she had written, in the Reviews of the day— Those reviews are forgotten, &amp; her book remains—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
                    <p>“I well remember seeing the life of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. E Darwin at my Uncle’s (D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Robert Darwin of Shrewsbury) many passages were marked by himself, as “<hi rend="underline">false</hi>” “<hi rend="underline">Utterly false</hi>” &amp;c— </p>
                    <p>“This book, I fear is lost, or mislaid, as I asked one of the family some years ago, if they had it when D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Richardson mentioned, he was collecting anecdotes of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. E Darwin—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
                    <p>“My Mother (née Violetta Darwin) the last surviving child of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. E Darwin still lives* &amp; has nearly attained her 88<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. year. Her mind is perfectly clear, &amp; would gladly answer any questions— </p>

<p>P.S. I ought to add, my Mother never saw M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Schimmelpennings life— We purposely kept it from her—knowing how it would distress her—&amp; she never expressed a wish to have it to read—tho’ she read a great deal during the day—</p>
