                    <p>Many thanks for the 5 kinds of seeds: all have germinated, &amp; the Cassia seedlings have interested me much, &amp; I daresay that I shall find something curious in the other plants.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Nor have I alone profited, for Sir J. Hooker who was here on Sunday was very glad of some of the seeds for Kew.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I am particularly obliged for the information about the earth-worms. I suppose that the soil in your forests is very loose; for in ground which has lately been dug in England, the worms do not come to the surface, but deposit their castings in the midst of the loose soil.—</p>
                    <p>I have some grand plants (&amp; I formerly sent seeds to Kew) of the cleistogamic grass; but they show no signs of producing flowers of any kind as yet.— Your case of the panicle with open flowers being sterile is parallel to that of Leersia oryzoides: I have always fancied that cross-fertilisation would perhaps make such panicles fertile.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am working away as hard as I can at all the multifarious kinds of movements of plants, &amp; am trying to reduce them to some simple rules; but whether I shall succeed I do not know.</p>
<p>With many thanks &amp; sincere respect— | Yours very truly | Ch. Darwin.</p>
                    <p>I have sent the curious Lepidoptera case to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meldola.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The seeds have not been identified. The latest extant letter from Müller that CD would have received by this date is the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11463.xml">letter from Fritz Müller, 5 April 1878</ref>, but the seeds mentioned may have been sent by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3069.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hermann Müller</ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11592.xml">letter from Hermann Müller, 5 July 1878</ref>). Müller had sent seeds of <hi rend="italic">Cassia neglecta</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Senna neglecta</hi>) with his April letter, but many of these had been destroyed (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11512.xml">letter to Fritz Müller, 16 May 1878</ref> and n. 3). In a letter to Müller of <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11233.xml">13 November 1877</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 25), CD had asked for more seeds of a species of the leguminous genus <hi rend="italic">Cassia</hi>; seedlings of these were later identified in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5637.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Movement in plants</hi></ref>, p. 34, as <hi rend="italic">Cassia tora</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Senna tora</hi>). It is unlikely that the identification was correct since <hi rend="italic">Cassia tora</hi> is not native to the Americas; the specimens were probably seedlings of <hi rend="italic">Senna obtusifolia</hi>, a South American species often confused with <hi rend="italic">C. tora</hi>. </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref> visited CD from 20 to 22 July 1878 (<ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242)).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD evidently refers to a now missing letter, probably written in June 1878 (see n. 4, below). CD sent seeds of the Brazilian grass to Kew on 31 January 1878  (<hi rend="italic">Inwards book</hi>, Archives, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew). CD had studied cleistogamic flowers in the grass <hi rend="italic">Leersia oryzoides</hi> (rice cutgrass) in 1864 (his notes are in DAR 111: A39, A40); he published these observations in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7749.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Three forms of <hi rend="italic">Lythrum salicaria</hi>’</ref>, pp. 191–2 n. (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 131). CD also observed <hi rend="italic">Leersia oryzoides</hi> in later years (his notes are in DAR 111: A37–8, A58, and DAR 111: B15), and concluded that it appeared to be one of the few species that was perpetually self-fertilised (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 2: 91 and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, pp. 333–5). </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">No letter to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3289.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Raphael Meldola</ref> mentioning a Lepidoptera case has been found, but CD may have enclosed the case in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11627.xml">letter to Meldola of 24 July [1878]</ref>. In a letter from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3070.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Fritz Müller</ref> to his brother <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3069.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hermann Müller</ref> of 25 June 1878, Müller mentioned observing a caterpillar that rolled a leaf of a pepper bush (family Piperaceae) around itself to form a case; the butterfly that emerged was a species of <hi rend="italic">Anaea</hi> (Möller ed. 1915–21, 2: 381–2). <hi rend="italic">Anaea fabius</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Consul fabius</hi>, the tiger leafwing) behaves as <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3070.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Fritz Müller</ref> described from the fourth instar larval stage until pupation (for a detailed description, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10615.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Muyshondt 1974</ref>, pp. 85–6).</note>
