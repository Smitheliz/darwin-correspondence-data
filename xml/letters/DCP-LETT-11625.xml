                    <p>I am <hi rend="underline">deeply</hi> obliged to you for so kindly writing to me upon our very sad loss.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> She was a very dear and good child, and very much beloved by us.</p>
<p>But all this ought to do away our sorrow— I cannot say it does so. Your handwriting is so exactly as of old, that I cannot help hoping you are in tolerable health.</p>
<p>I have been looking over many of your old, old letters of late. They have recalled days, seldom long out of memory—</p>
                    <p>I always love to dwell upon Shrewsbury in those times. Your good Father hangs up in my little study—reminding me of his great kindnesses to me; and at the same time of 〈Ca〉roline who made the likeness— of Susan full of goodness &amp;<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Those were gold letter days indeed.</p>
<p>We have both had many happy days since—but they want the joyousness—the overflowingness of youth, and youths friendship.</p>
                    <p>Some six weeks since I attended the Funeral of my oldest Naturalist Friend Hewitson.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I knew him when we were both very young, &amp; afterwards we were intimate friends thro a very chequered life on his part. He spent much of his time, and the Income of a large fortune, upon his favorite pursuit—Lepidopte〈ra.〉 Having lost his wife<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; without family he could afford to keep Naturalists in Africa and South America—and for very many years has published a beautiful work which he drew and coloured all the plates for at a loss of 30£ per month.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>He has left a splendid collection to the British Museum.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I shall miss him very much.</p>
                    <p>Owing to our childs long illness, we have not yet made the acquaintance of your daughter at Basset.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I hope we shall now do so, and get them to pay us a visit. He kindly wrote to me lately. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Fox<ref target="#foot.f9"/> sends her kindest regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin— Excuse this stupid 〈note〉</p>
<p>〈Yours〉 always | W. D. Fox</p>
