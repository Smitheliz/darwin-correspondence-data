<p>I thank you for your very kind &amp; deeply interesting letter of March 1 received yesterday; &amp; for the present of y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> work which no doubt I shall soon receive from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hooker.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The sudden appearance of so many Dicotyledons in the Upper Chalk appears to me a most perplexing phenomenon to all who believe in any form of Evolution, &amp; especially to those who believe in extremely gradual Evolution, to which view I know that you are strong〈ly〉 opposed.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The presence of even one true Angiosperm in the Lower Chalk makes me inclined to conjecture that plants of this great Division must have been largely developed in some isolated area; whence owing to Geographical changes they at last succeeded in escaping &amp; spread quickly over the World. But I fully admit that this case is a great difficulty in the views which I hold. Many as have been the wonderful discoveries in Geology during the last half Century I think none have exceeded in interest your results with respect to the plants which formally existed in the Arctic regions. How I wish that similar collections could be made in the Southern Hemisphere for instance in Kerguelen’s Land.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>The death of Sir C Lyell is a great loss to Science, but I do not think to himself, for after parlysis &amp; epilepsy it was scarcely possible that he could have retained his mental powers, &amp; he would have suffered dreadfully from their loss.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The last time I saw him he was speaking with the most lively interest about his last visit to you &amp; I was grieved to hear from him a very poor account of your health.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have been working for some time on a special subject namely insectivorous plants; I do not know whether the subject will interest you but when my book is published I will have the pleasure of sending you a copy.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I am very much obliged for your photograph &amp; enclose one of myself.</p>
<p>With the highest esteem | I remain my dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9876.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Oswald Heer, 1 March 1875</ref>. In his earlier studies of Tertiary floras (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3482.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Heer 1855–9</ref>), Heer had argued that sudden, inexplicable change and the appearance of monstrosities were causal factors in the production of new species. CD had argued that the existence of so many coadaptations in plants and animals was evidence against Heer’s view (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4196.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 31 May [1863]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD had an interest in the flora of Kerguelen Island because of its close relation to the flora of the geographically distant Tierra del Fuego (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 5, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1602.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. S. Henslow, 17 November [1854]</ref>).

He had been in poor health since the end of 1874 (K. M. Lyell ed. 1890, 2: 438–9). Hooker had reported to CD in mid-February that Lyell was too unwell to see him and that his mind was confused (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9860.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 17 February 1875</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD’s last recorded visit to Lyell was on 4 December 1874 (<ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242)).
