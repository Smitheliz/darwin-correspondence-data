            <p>Thanks to WDF’s directions, Anne’s tombstone has been found.</p>
            <p>CD improved, but recovery is slow. She describes treatment.</p> 
<p>Encloses paper she and CD have written [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">4294</hi>, which was wrongly addressed by ED and had not reached WDF].</p>

<p>I am writing instead of Charles to thank you for your precise answer to his enquiry.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am glad to say that by the help of your directions &amp; the lady at whose house our poor Annie lodged we have found the tomb stone.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is very much covered with trees &amp; looks so green &amp; old I am sure I looked at it many times thinking it quite out of the question that should be it. Also the iron palisades are gone, at least both the sexton<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; lady thought there had been rails round it, but that does not signify. This has been a great relief.</p>
<p>Charles has been quite ill last week but for the last 5 days he has decidedly improved, but I expect his recovery will be very slow.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>We like D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ayerst tho’ he has not the influence of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gully. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. it is hopeless to try to see tho’ I must say he has been to see Ch. twice &amp; he quite approves of his treatment.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> He takes 2 or 3 wet rubbings in the day &amp; small walks in the garden, but he is weak— Our stay here has however been of real use to our sick boy &amp; put us on a better system with him.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Ch. appetite is so good I think he must get strength soon &amp; he has struggled on for 5 days without sickness.</p>
<p>I sent you a paper concocted between Ch. &amp; myself wisely directed to Delamere <hi rend="underline">Droitwich</hi> &amp; so I will put in another in hopes you may employ it in some way.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I have met with a good deal of encouragement &amp; I see it today in the Worcester paper endorsed by the Member of Parliament<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Will you remember us both very kindly to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Fox<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; | believe me | yours very sincerely | E. Darwin</p>
