<p>I will do my very best, be assured, to get the information you want.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have put your printed list into the hands of several persons, but without any good result so far.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have also directed the attention of persons having to do with working elephants to the question as to whether these animals do really shed tears when in distress.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>With regard to the monkey, I know of no tame ones in this immediate neighbourhood—that is of the bearded “wanderoo” &amp; I have only seen single ones in confinement. In the jungles I have observed them at play—family parties, I fancy—but never fighting.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have had no opportunity of seeing natives under the influence of emotional feeling except in the case quite lately of a Cinghalese<ref target="#foot.f5"/> woman who had just lost her husband—(a gardener under my orders)—&amp; who came to announce his death to me and to beg me to allow her to continue to occupy the house she &amp; her husband had been living in. The woman threw herself about &amp; made a great blubbering &amp; howling, but her countenance indicated no genuine grief in its expression, and there was a perfectly apathetic look between the paroxysms.</p>
<p>I have got quite into the habit of observing the expression of natives faces as I meet them, &amp; really there is usually very little expression at all even when they are talking together, but there is sometimes slyness &amp; sometimes vindictiveness very evidently indicated and just as it would be exhibited in an English face, as it appears to me. But does one not observe the same in dogs, horses &amp; other animals?</p>
<p>Always very sincerely yr’s | G. H. K. Thwaites</p>
<p>I write this in haste as I have some preparations to make this evening for an early start into the jungles tomorrow.</p>
