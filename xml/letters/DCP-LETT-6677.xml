<p>I have finished y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> book; it seems to me excellent, &amp; at the same time most pleasant to read.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> That you ever returned alive is wonderful after all y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> risks from illness &amp; sea voyages, especially that most interesting one to Waigiou &amp; back.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Of all the impressions which I have rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> from y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> book the strongest is that y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> perseverance in the cause of science was heroic. Your descriptions of catching the splendid butterflies have made me quite envious, &amp; at the same time have made me feel almost young again, so vividly have they brought before my mind old days when I collected, tho’ I never made such captures as yours. Certainly collecting is the best sport in the world. I shall be astonished if y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> book has not a great success; &amp; your splendid generalizations on Geog. Distrib., with which I am familiar from y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> papers, will be new to most of your readers. I think I enjoyed most the Timor case, as it is best demonstrated; but perhaps Celebes is really the most valuable.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> prefer looking at the whole Asiatic continent as having formerly been more African in its fauna, than admitting the former existence of a continent across the Indian ocean.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Decaisne’s paper on the flora of Timor in which he points out its close relation to that of the Mascarene I.s supports y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> view.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> On the other hand I might advance the giraffes &amp;c in the Sevalik deposits.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> How I wish some one w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> collect the plants of Banca! The puzzle of Java, Sumatra &amp; Borneo is like the 3 geese &amp; foxes: I have a wish to extend Malacca thro’ Banca to part of Java &amp; thus make 3 parallel peninsulas, but I cannot get the geese &amp; foxes across the river.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Many parts of y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> book have interested me much: I always wished to hear an independent judgment about the Rajah Brooke, &amp; now I have been delighted with y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> splendid eulogium on him.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>With respect to the fewness &amp; inconspicuousness of the flowers in the Tropics, may it not be accounted for by the hosts of insects, so that there is no need for the flowers to be conspicuous. As according to Humboldt fewer plants are social in the tropical than in the temperate regions, the flowers in the former w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not make so great a show.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>In y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> note you speak of observing some inelegancies of style, I notice none. All is as clear as daylight. I have detected 2 or 3 errata.</p>
<p>In vol 1. you write Sond<hi rend="underline">i</hi>acus   is this not an error?<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Vol 2. p 236 for <hi rend="underline">Western</hi> side of Aru read <hi rend="underline">Eastern</hi>.</p>
<p>p. 315 Do you not mean the horns of the moose? for the elk has not palmated horns.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I have only one criticism of a general nature, &amp; I am not sure that other geologists w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> agree with me: you repeatedly speak as if the pouring out of lava &amp;c from Volcanoes actually caused the subsidence of an adjoining area; I quite agree that areas undergoing opposite movements are some how connected;<ref target="#foot.f13"/> but volcanic out bursts must I think be looked at as mere accidents in the swelling up of a great dome or surface of <hi rend="underline">plutonic</hi> rocks,—&amp; there seems no more reason to conclude that such swelling or elevation in mass is the cause of the subsidence, than that the subsidence is the cause of the elevation; which latter view is indeed held by some geologists.</p>
<p>I have regretted to find so little about the habits of the many animals which you have seen.</p>
<p>In Vol 2. p. 399 I wish I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> see the connection between variations having been first or long ago selected &amp; their appearance at an earlier age in birds of Paradise than the variations which have subsequently arisen &amp; been selected. In fact I do not understand y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> explanation of the curious order of development of the ornaments of these birds.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Will you please to tell me whether you are sure that the female Casuarius (Vol. 2. 150 sits on her eggs as well as the male; for if I am not mistaken Bartlett told me that the male alone, who is less brightly coloured about the neck, sits on the eggs.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>In Vol. 2 p. 255 you speak of male savages ornamenting themselves more than the women, of which I have heard before; now have you any notion whether they do this to please themselves, or to excite the admiration of their fellow men, or to please the women, or, as is perhaps probable from all 3 motives.</p>
<p>Finally let me congratulate you heartily on having written so excellent a book, full of thought on all sorts of subjects. Once again let me thank you for the very great honour which you have done me by your dedication</p>
<p>Believe me | My dear Wallace | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>Vol. 2. p. 455   When in New Zealand I thought the inhabitants a mixed race, with the type of Tahiti preponderating over some darker race with more frizzled hair; &amp; now that the stone instruments reveal the existence of ancient inhabitants is it not probable that these Is<hi rend="superscript">ds</hi> were inhabited by true Papuans. Judging from descriptions the pure Tahitians must differ much from your Papuans.—</p>

Wallace concluded that the ‘miscellaneous character’ of the fauna of Timor supported CD’s view that oceanic islands had never been connected to the mainland (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 329). He argued that the animal forms on Celebes suggested the possibility of a former continent in the Indian Ocean with a link to Africa (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 445).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD refers to the vast beds of vertebrate fossils found in the Siwalik (Shiwalik) mountain range of Nepal and India. Fossils of several animals now found only in Africa have been found in these beds.</note>

CD may be alluding to the traditional game of fox and geese (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5936.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">OED</hi></ref>). Wallace had noted that the flora of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo was imperfectly known and also suggested that Banca, although geographically close to Sumatra, was geologically similar to Malacca and Singapore (see Wallace 1869a, 1: 215, 225–6).</note>

No letter from Bartlett discussing cassowaries has been found, but in a note dated 15 February 1857 (DAR 84.2: 178), CD wrote, ‘Casuarius galleatus male alone incubates &amp; takes care of young, but ♀ in development, &amp; bright colours of naked skin &amp; appendages all about neck, decidedly most developed so that anyone w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think she was male: Can their difference relate to safety in incubation?’</note>
