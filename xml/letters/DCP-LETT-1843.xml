<p>I was very glad to get your note &amp; congratulate you on your triumph about the Scotch Deer Hound, which however I do not know by sight.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> How I wish I further knew (can you find out for me) whether the real Scotch Deer Hounds breeds true; but I suppose this must be the case, whether or no your mongrel would do so.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> This seems to <hi rend="doubleUnderline">very valuable</hi> case for me, for it would be a most bold hypothesis to imagine that the real Scotch Deer Hound was a pure &amp; distinct aboriginal race, but that your mongrel,, though identical in appearance, was <hi rend="underline">essentially</hi> different: I do not even know what a common Deer Hound is.—</p>
<p>Many thanks for your continued remembrance of me &amp; my poultry skeletons: I am making some progress &amp; have been working a little at their ancient History &amp; was yesterday in the British Museum getting old Chinese Encyclopedias translated.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> This morning I have been carefully examining a splendid Cochin Cock sent me (but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be glad of another specimen) &amp; I find several important differences in number of feathers in alula,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> primaries &amp; tail, making me suspect quite a distinct species.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I am getting on best with Pigeons, &amp; have now almost every breed known in England alive: I shall find, I think great differences in skeleton for I find extra rib &amp; <hi rend="underline">dorsal</hi> vertebra in Pouter.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have just ordered the Cottage Gardener:<ref target="#foot.f7"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tegetmeier is a very kind &amp; clever little man; but he was not authorised to use my name in any way, &amp; we cannot be said to be working at all together; for our objects are very different, &amp; he began on skulls before I had thought on subject: I have not yet looked at our pickled chickens &amp; hardly know when I shall, for I have my hands very full of work; but they will come in some day most useful, as will a large series of young Pigeons, which I have myself killed &amp; pickled.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be very glad of old Sebright Bantam.—</p>
<p>I have been in London nearly all this week, working at Books<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; we had at Erasmus’s a very pleasant dinner &amp; sat between M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Bristowe &amp; was charmed with both.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Bristowe often so reminds me of you some 25 years ago in certain expression of face &amp; manner. They told me you had been far from well: why did you not mention yourself? Do not I always prose at good length about myself &amp; pursuits. So I will say that my stomach has been better for some months than average, &amp; I am able decidedly to work harder.— My sisters are pretty well: you heard of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Parkers release about 2 months ago.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>How I do wish I had you nearer to talk over &amp; benefit by your opinions on the many odds &amp; ends on which I am at work. Sometimes I fear I shall break down for my subject gets bigger &amp; bigger with each months work.—</p>
<p>My dear old friend | Most truly yours | Ch. Darwin</p>
