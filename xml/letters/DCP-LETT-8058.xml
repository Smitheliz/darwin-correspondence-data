            <p>Thanks JF for his lectures, the arguments of which he finds very forcible; is glad to see JF has detected the falseness of much of Mivart’s reasoning.</p>

<p>I am greatly obliged to you for having sent me through my son, your lectures;<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; for the very honorable manner in which you allude to my works. The lectures seem to me to be written with much force, clearness &amp; originality. You shew also a truly extraordinary amount of knowledge of all that has been published on the subject. The type in many parts is so small, that except to young eyes, it is very difficult to read. Therefore I wish that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> reflect on their separate publication;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> though so much has been published on the subject that the public may possibly have had enough. I hope that this may be your intention; for I do not think I have ever seen the general argument more forcibly put so as to convert unbelievers: It has surprized &amp; pleased me to see that you &amp; others have detected the falseness of much of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mivart’s reasoning.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I wish I had read yr lectures a month or two ago, as I have been preparing a new edit. of the “Origin” in which I answer some special points, &amp; I believe I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have found yr lectures useful; but my M.S is now in the printers hands &amp; I have not strength or time to make any more additions.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>With my thanks &amp; good wishes | I remain my dear Sir | yours sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. By an odd coincidence since the above was written I have rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> yr very obliging letter of Oct. 23. I did notice the point to which you refer &amp; will hereafter reflect more over it.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I was indeed on the point of putting in a sentence to somewhat of the same effect in the new ed. of the Origin, in relation to the query why have not apes advanced in intellect as much as man; but I omitted it on account of the asserted prolonged infancy of the Orang.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am, also, a little doubtful about the distinction between gregariousness &amp; sociability.—Mem, case of Baboons.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> When I have time &amp; strength, I will reread your discussions—</p>
<p>When you come to England I shall have much pleasure in making your acquaintance; but my health is habitually so weak that I have very small power of conversing with my friends as much as I wish—</p>
<p>Let me again thank you for y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> letter. To believe that I have at all influenced the minds of able men is the greatest satisfaction which I am capable of receiving.</p>
