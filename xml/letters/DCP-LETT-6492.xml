<p>I owe you much for many kindnesses, the last, your letter, received yesterday is by no means the least and I am indeed very much obliged to you for it.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> When I tell you my own standing point you will see how glad I am of a confirmation of my own impressions. Poor Archbishop Sumner who was not always the wisest of men led me into the business which prevented my resigning Downe years ago.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> We hoped long before now we should have got a good Parsonage built on some good site, (the site has been the obstacle as the money is ready), &amp; the living further augmented. I had a notion if this could be done that I should have liked to come back among you. Diis aliter visum.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> No one can more lament the recent troubles than I do, but I am justified in saying that, however I have failed, I am the only one who tried to do anything. I tried hard for the restoration of the Church, and failed, because people fought for pews &amp; got the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to attend to them.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I found money for a house, but no one would give, or even sell, a bit of land to build on, and even a clerical house will not stand on air. With any such help as is often afforded to an impoverished benefice by laymen there would have been a much more satisfactory condition.</p>
<p>I imagine, as long as Stephens<ref target="#foot.f5"/> was with you, things were pretty straight. I left them in that order, chiefly because I thought I might return if a house could be got. When Stephens departed, and hastily let the house he had away from me, I decided to give up as early as possible. I had several communications with the late Archbishop, and we had consulted on a plan which would probably have been carried out to the advantage of all, but he is gone, and that done for.</p>
<p>How men can get testimonials, or how people write in such a careless way about Clergymen I cannot imagine. No one could have taken more pains to enquire about Horsman than I did, nor could answers well have been more satisfactory.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Robinson<ref target="#foot.f7"/> seemed from accounts little less than a saint, but I never contemplated his remaining longer than I could arrange, either to restore the patronage to the Archbishop which I proposed to do and resign immediately, or make some other disposition.</p>
<p>I hoped he would have been a hard zealous labourer, as he was represented to me, and make up for some of Horsman’s sins. But he soon wrote me that he was going for a week or two to visit his brother at Dover; he wrote in terms of anything but satisfaction of the people of Downe on several occasions. As I know Downe, &amp; not him, the impression made on me was rather opposite to the one intended, that the Downe people being very fair as times go he is not a desirable Curate, whereupon when he intimated to me that he was to be away for some weeks I recommended him to resign. This brought an intimation that he should be back before Christmas, this I acknowledged, and repeated my recommendation that he should resign at once. This last letter together with one to Sir J Lubbock<ref target="#foot.f8"/> on the subject went yesterday.</p>
<p>Of all plans open now the best to my mind would be that Arch Bishop Sumners acts should be simply undone and the Archbishop<ref target="#foot.f9"/> resume all responsibility but it seems there are legal difficulties or this would have been done nearly a year ago. Next that Sir J Lubbock as the largest proprietor and a Churchman should be the Patron and appoint— If neither of these can be managed I must find some other plan— It is not any advantage to me to hold it   I have spent thousands in living at Downe while the income only paid house rent, and more than I received every year since I left, so you may believe I am quite sincere in saying I hope Robinson will take my recommendation and resign and that before his three months notice has expired a new and satisfactory Vicar may be appointed—</p>
<p>I paid to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Robinson my subscription of £5<hi rend="superscript">.</hi>5 for the school. I also send the amount M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Horsman was due for day and Sunday School.</p>
<p>I am not sure if I have in former years subscribed for Coal and clothing Club. I rather fancy that when I augmented M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Stephens’ stipend I discontinued it, but if I subscribed last year, or if you are in want of funds I shall be happy to give the amount formerly subscribed.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I have not time to look into accounts and save post</p>
<p>I could hardly congratulate you on the election any way as if I had not had an excuse for being away we should have been on opposite sides</p>
<p>If I could have voted as from personal feeling apart from politics I should have liked I should have voted for Sir John and Talbot. If one on each side had got in I should have desired those two<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Please give M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Innes’ with my own kindest regards to your family party. Johny I am sorry to say is poorly, and I am in doubt whether I may not have to run over to Germany to see about him.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
