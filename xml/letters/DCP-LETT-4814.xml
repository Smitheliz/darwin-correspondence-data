            <p>Visited by Antoine Auguste Laugel.</p>
            <p>Guessed right on Bentham’s "Planchon".</p> 
<p>Much struck by Thomson’s article on nomenclature [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">4812</hi>]; importance of this subject.</p> 
            <p>Sorry best scientists read so little; few read any long papers.</p>

<p>We have been quite gay: J. Lubbock came here on Friday to lunch &amp; was very pleasant:<ref target="#foot.f1"/> you will be glad to hear that he did not speak seriously of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. L. &amp; I suspect it is only case of family-wayishness.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The more I think of it, the sorrier I am about parliament, though yet I do not at all like the thought of his being beaten.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He says that he hears that his Book on Man will tell heavily against him.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He will be Sir John, before very long, for poor old Sir J. has heart-mischief &amp; is dropsical.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>On Sunday we had a call from M. Laugel, geologist &amp; litterateur, a very agreeable, clever, &amp; charming man: just returned from N. America &amp; very enthusiastic for the Federals &amp; very sanguine for their future in every respect.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I will keep Bot. Zeitung for about one week—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I have read N. Hist R. &amp; guessed right to myself that Bentham wrote on Planchon;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I liked the article; but as I had just read the essay there was not much new to me.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have been very much struck by Thomson’s article: it seems to me quite remarkable for its judgment, force &amp; clearness. It has interested me greatly.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I had sometimes <hi rend="underline">loosely</hi> speculated on what nomenclature would come to &amp; concluded that it would be trinomial. What a name a plant will formally bear with the authors name after genus (as some recommend) &amp; after species &amp; subspecies! It really seems one of the greatest questions which can now be discussed for systematic Nat. Hist.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> How impartially Thomson adjusts the claims of “hair-splitters” &amp; “lumpers”<ref target="#foot.f12"/>   I sincerely hope he will pretty often write reviews or essays. It is an old subject of grief to me, formerly in geology, &amp; of late in Zoolog. &amp; Botany, that the very best men, (excepting those who have to write Principles &amp; Elements &amp;c)<ref target="#foot.f13"/> read so little &amp; give up nearly their whole time to original work; I have often thought that science would progress more if there was more reading. How few read any long &amp; laborious papers. The only use of publishing such seems to be as a proof that author has given time &amp; labour to his work.</p>
<p>Well farewell my dear old fellow— let me hear before very long how Sir William is—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>

Thomas Thomson’s article was a critical review of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alexis Jordan’s</ref> attempt to establish by experiment the permanence or variability of plant forms, with a view to providing a new system of classification (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4246.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Jordan 1864</ref>). Near the start of the article, Thomson wrote: ‘Darwin’s marvellous observations have of late set all the world thinking about variation and variability, and have already stimulated to an enormous extent the observing faculties of naturalists’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7736.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Thomson] 1865</ref>, p. 227). Thomson used his review of Jordan’s work as a point of departure for discussing classification systems in taxonomic botany and zoology in general.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">Thomson discussed trinomial systems of botanical nomenclature in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7736.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Thomson] 1865</ref>, pp. 238–41. In 1842, CD had served on a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science to ‘draw up a series of rules with a view to establishing the nomenclature of zoology on a uniform and permanent basis’ (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 2 and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5146.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">McOuat 1996</ref>). CD developed his understanding of scientific nomenclature further in the course of his study of barnacles, which involved him in practical problems of classification (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Introduction and Appendix II); CD’s ideas developed further in discussions with Hooker on classification in botany (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 7, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2225.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, [25] February 1858</ref>). In 1842, the British Association rules of nomenclature had codified a binomial system in which each species was given two names, one to designate the genus and one the species, followed by the author’s name in parentheses whenever the species name was joined to a new generic name (see Strickland <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> 1863). However, by the end of the century the consensus amongst taxonomists in Europe and North America that had allowed the adoption of these rules had broken down, and a trinomial system of naming a species by genus, species, and sub-species began to be adopted by some zoologists and botanists, to take account of geographic variation (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5336.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Mayr 1942</ref>, pp. 108–11, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7510.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Stresemann 1975</ref>, pp. 264–7, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7396.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Stace 1980</ref>, pp. 206–10, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7468.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Stevens 1994</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7736.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Thomson] 1865</ref>, pp. 226 and 235–6, discussed the different conclusions of ‘local botanists’, who made detailed observations of a limited number of plants inhabiting a small area, and of ‘general botanists’, who made extensive surveys of a wide range and large number of plants. The former, characterised here by CD as ‘hair-splitters’, tended to create more species according to the small differences they observed; the latter, the ‘lumpers’, tried to ‘grasp the whole range of plant forms, and … came to overlook or under-estimate the importance of minute characters’, thereby creating a ‘bias in favour of combination, rather than separation’. Jordan, whose work Thomson was reviewing, was well known for naming a large number of species (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 5, letters from H. C. Watson, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1740.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">13 August 1855</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1758.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">2 October 1855</ref>, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 8, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2793.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from H. C. Watson, 10 May 1860</ref>).
