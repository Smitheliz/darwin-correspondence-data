<p>I have just been reading with the deepest interest y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. “Descent of Man”   It has been the means of rendering many nights of suffering more endurable</p>
<p>May I venture to hope you will forgive me for addressing you on one or two subjects of w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. you treat? I have lived much in the country surrounded by animals, &amp; for many years took an active part in the formation of a large collection of insects, very many of w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. we reared f<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. the eggs. During a long residence on the continent we collecte〈d〉 numberless specimens of the horn〈ed〉 beetles, w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. if I understand you righ〈tl〉y you say are not provided with these appendages for the purpose of battle.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> We found <hi rend="underline">very many</hi> with their horns broken, &amp; some with broken legs—especially the front legs—</p>
<p>The Musk beetle w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. abounds at the Baths of Lucca<ref target="#foot.f2"/> we also often found with brok〈en〉 antennæ, as if they had been engaged in fighting—sometimes with one almost pulled out. Requiring a little gum when set, one summer—when they were more numerous than usual, we had some difficulty in getting perfect specimens</p>
<p>The subject of transmitted tendencies has always interested me much. Y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. work brought to my recollection a curious instance</p>
<p>When moving across a room not long ago I was startled by an exclamation of surprise f<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. my Mother<ref target="#foot.f3"/> who roused me to the fact, <hi rend="underline">quite unnoticed by me</hi> that I had taken up my chair with both hands &amp; had carried it across with me against my back. She then told me that my g<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. g<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.mother (my g<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.<hi rend="underline">father’s</hi> mother) who 〈die〉d <hi rend="doubleUnderline">long</hi> before I was born had 〈this〉 habit, &amp; that having seen me do it when quite a child, she had at once prevented me acquiring the trick. I was nearly <hi rend="underline">fifty</hi> when this seemingly forgotten tendency once more appeared.</p>
<p>Since then I have more than once stopped myself preparing so to convey my chair—&amp; to my amusement I discove〈re〉d only the other day the same pe〈cul〉iarity in a distant relation her g<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.father having married my g<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. g<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>mother’s sister—so she was not even closely related. Will you think me very audacious if I venture to say, I seem to see a greater likeness between our dear faithful companion the dog—when arrived at maturity—&amp; ourselves, than even between the embryo wonderful as that is. I think dogs <hi rend="underline">are</hi> capable of <hi rend="underline">deep thought</hi> or contemplation— they seem at times quite in a state of abstraction—. I have seen an old terrier apparently so lost in some deep meditation as to be quite unconscious that she was called to take a walk. &amp; I have had to rouse he〈r〉 f<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. her reverie, when the pleasure shewed convinced me her unusu〈al〉 disregard of the summons was not caused by disinclination to move. Nor was she asleep at the time, for I had seen her <hi rend="underline">instinctively</hi> move when the servant had brushed passed her, a liberty she always resented more or less according to her humor<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I believe she not only reflected but harboured many passions feelings supposed not to be shared with us by animals— On one occasion I threatened her with a light driving whip— I simply laid it across her back   it c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. scarcely have tickled her, she quietly &amp; deliberately walked out of the hall door &amp; hid herself among the laurels, just to vex me—&amp; it was not till 12 oc<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>. at night that the groom found her.</p>
<p>Her attachment to me was extreme, but for ten days after this, she took no more notice of me than if I had not existed   She took no food offered by me, she ignored me, &amp; never <hi rend="underline">seemed</hi> to see 〈o〉r hear me— She kept up this punishm<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. till one day, happening to meet her on the stairs, I sat down 〈b〉elow her put my arms round her &amp; 〈tried〉 to coax her— she resisted at first, but when by degrees she felt herself drawn into her old resting place, her delight at finding herself there was too strong for her   she suddenly relented &amp; for many days did not let me out of her sight for a moment, but clung to me with greater fondness than ever—.</p>
<p>She seemed to act with the deliberate intention of punishing me— That same terrier having been beaten by a servant, for chasing the hens when a pup, on becoming a mother used to sit on a step overlooking the poultry yard, to watch her pups who early shewed her fondness for the chase—&amp; when they transgressed she w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. catch them by the hind leg &amp; drag them away thus teaching them herself—in order to prevent their being beaten— Surely here reasoning power was displayed—not called forth by any accidental circumstance arising at the moment—but connected with what had taken place <hi rend="underline">long</hi> before—&amp; w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. must have been remembered &amp; <hi rend="underline">thought</hi> over carefully &amp; in her treatment of me there seems to have been not only anger, for what she looked upon as an indignity, but something in her—w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. resented what she must have <hi rend="underline">argued</hi> out to herself to have been an act of <hi rend="underline">injustice</hi>. I <hi rend="underline">thought</hi> she had been out all the afternoon—&amp; had often seen her punished for a like offence— it turned out she had only been at the gate with the groom— While speaking of animals resenting supposed injuries I cannot but call to mind an instance of a favourite thoughbred mare— She was perfectly gentle, but fiery if not carefully handled. She was trained by our own groom a peculiarly gentle man with animals, who had never touched her with a whip, one day he happened to have one when exercising her &amp; on her refusing to stand for a moment when near home, he gave her one cut with it. At the time she merely gave a slight brisk jump, but when in her loose stall— after the saddle &amp; bridle had been removed, just as the groom was leaving the stable—she <hi rend="underline">deliberately walked after</hi> him seemed to measure her distance turne〈d〉 &amp; kicked him, without any show of temper— her ears were not put back. Nor did she repeat the kick nor c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. she have intended to hurt him <hi rend="underline">much</hi>—as if she had—she might 〈h〉ave injured him severely— This was the <hi rend="underline">only</hi> time the mare kicked him or anybody else. Was not this the fruit of thought? I cannot but think too that dogs <hi rend="underline">have</hi> some kind of <hi rend="underline">〈c〉onscience</hi>— by conscience, I understand not that, w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. <hi rend="underline">teaches</hi> us what is right, but that within us, w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. tells us whether our actions are in accordance with those laws w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. we believe—whether rightly or wrongly—to be binding on us.—</p>
<p>We had a water spaniel of rare intelligence, he understood Italian <hi rend="underline">well</hi>, as well as English, &amp; we had not had a french servant long till he understood him perfectly— this dog was an unmitigated thief &amp; very self willed— Although he knew a beating w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. surely follow a theft, he invariably came to tell us of his delinquencies &amp; it was his confession w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. generally first brought the loss of the meat or fish to our knowledge, he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. <hi rend="underline">crawl</hi> into the room &amp; put himself down at my feet, sighing audibly.</p>
<p>I fancy on these occasions the beat〈ing〉 was of a mild character, yet it seemed to hurt his feelings so mu〈ch〉 that he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. retire into private lif〈e〉 for the rest of the day &amp; remain below stairs in company with the servant w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. he <hi rend="underline">never</hi> did any other time. He used to lay regular traps &amp; devise strategems to get himself let out— his favourite plan was to <hi rend="underline">retch violently</hi>. When all the occupants of the drawingroom w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. fly to the door— once outside his whole demeanour suddenly changed—&amp; as <hi rend="underline">plainly</hi> as <hi rend="underline">dog</hi> could do, he laughed at us all as he scampered off out of reach—generally stopping at the foot of the stairs to give one defiant bark. I do believe he felt genuine sorrow— when his thieving propensities got the better of him—&amp; though on his return from his excursions we <hi rend="underline">never</hi> beat him—having let him out ourselves—he used to appear horribly ashamed &amp; if possible w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. creep in unobserved—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. fill vol<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. with the extraordinary traits I have observed in animals, those 〈of〉 y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> works I have read have interested 〈me〉 very much—Natural history in all its branches having always been a favourite study with me, during a long period of enforced illness— I trust this may plead my excuse for inflicting these lines upon you.</p>
<p>Would not yr influence do much to prevent the <hi rend="underline">wanton</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">unnecessary</hi> torture of those animals that are our faithful friends &amp; companions &amp; that—<hi rend="underline">it may be</hi>—possess higher faculties than most people give them credit for— <hi rend="underline">I</hi> w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not purchase freedom f<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. my pain—&amp; I know b〈ut〉 well—what pain is—at the cost of harming one poor animal whe〈n〉 subject to vivisection—unless under conditions, w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. would render the experiment painless<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>

<p>Since writing this, I have read with <hi rend="underline">delight one</hi> passage in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gregs’ ‘Enigmas of Life’. He speaks of a <hi rend="underline">possible</hi> future for <hi rend="underline">some</hi> animals a belief w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. as you know was at any rate not condemned by Luther<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
