<p>I greatly needed the assurance contained in your most kind and precious letter; and if it is difficult for me to understand how I can have won your regard I will at least accept all you say with the utmost gratitude<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You will forgive me I know if I cannot now speak of all that has happened except to tell you that I am happy and that my trust and confidence in your son could not be greater than it is—</p>
<p>I have been brought up in all American ideas and ways, and I have sad fears sometimes that they may prove a trial to him— I shall learn in time, however, to adapt myself to new habits, and I am so sure of his goodness that my hopes far outstretch my fears— I am determined not to feel that this is a strange land, or that I am quite separated from my own most peaceful home. The happiness that I have had will still live with me, and will even serve to make me contented at Southampton—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> May I always deserve the great generosity you have shown me.</p>
                    <p>Ever yours affectionately | Sara Sedgwick.</p>
