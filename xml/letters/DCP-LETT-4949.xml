<p>I have received your interesting letter of Oct. 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. with its new facts on branch-tendrils.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> If the Linn. Soc. publishes your paper, as I am sure it ought to do, I will append a note with some of these new facts.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I forwarded immediately your M.S. to Prof. Max Schultze but I did not read it, for German hand writing utterly puzzles me, &amp; I am so weak I am capable of no exertion: I took the liberty however of asking him to send me a copy if separate ones are printed;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; I reminded him about the spunge paper.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I knew of the difference in the spicula, but your difficulty had not occurred to me; from analogy I should rather expect that spunges have existed with spicula of the 2 kinds, &amp; that the one had ultimately preponderated over the other.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>You will have received before this my book on Orchids &amp; I wish I had known that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have preferred the English edition. Should the German ed. fail to reach you I will send an English one.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>That is a curious observation of your daughter about the movement of the apex of the stem of Linum &amp; w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> I think be worth following out; I suspect many plants move a little, following the sun; but all do not for I have watched some pretty carefully.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I can give you no Zoological news for I live the life of the most secluded hermit.</p>
<p>I occasionally hear from Ernst Haeckel who seems as determined as you are to work out the subject of the change of species. You will have seen his curious paper on certain Medusæ reproducing themselves by seminal generation at two periods of growth.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>With sincere respect | Believe me my dear Sir | Yours very truly | Ch. Darwin</p>

Müller thought it unlikely that either form was the ancestor of the other. In his paper (Müller 1865c, p. 351), Müller proposed that the sponge <hi rend="italic">Darwinella aurea</hi> represented the ancestral form from which both types could have developed, because it possessed spicules composed entirely of organic fibres with no mineral component.</note>
