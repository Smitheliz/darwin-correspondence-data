<p>I was extremely glad to get your note at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich’s, telling me about your paper.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have just seen your work noticed in the summary in the Times. I am very glad that you went to York, &amp; I feel sure that it was proper for you to do so in person.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I have had a long &amp; pleasant talk with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Rich, &amp; there is something about him, which pleases me much; he is so simple &amp; modest. I think that I told you that I thought myself bound to tell him of the large fortune from Erasmus. &amp; that under such changed circumstances I considered him <hi rend="underline">most fully</hi> justified in altering his will.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I begged him to consider it for a week, &amp; then let me hear his decision. But he would not let me finish, &amp; protested he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. do nothing of the kind &amp; that with so many sons I required much money. In this I heartily agree; though your mother is quite sorry! I now feel convinced that nothing will induce him to change.— He is in doubt about executors, as his sister is one &amp; is now old. &amp; he asked me whether William w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be one, if hereafter he so determined; &amp; please tell William that I answered for him &amp; said that I was sure he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. feel bound to act to the best of his power as his executor, if so appointed.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> As I feel now pretty sure of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richs fortune, it is all the more necessary for me to arrange my will on some fair scale of proportions to sons &amp; daughters. I fear that poor dear old William will have been worked to death &amp; will not have had time to calculate about the value of my property, with that of Erasmus added. But I ought to settle soon, &amp; when you are at Down, I will get out my will &amp; codicils, &amp; settle what I ought to do, that is if I possibly can do so.—</p>
