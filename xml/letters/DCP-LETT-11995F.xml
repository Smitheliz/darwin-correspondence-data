                    <p>I thank you much for your kind note &amp; for all the trouble which you have taken &amp; for the note of Introduction. I do not know when my son will be able to go to Elston.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>Since writing to you, in wading through the old letters, I have come across one to my Father from R. W. Darwin who says “I suppose you know my Father was a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Barrister</hi> at Law, took his Degree at Lincoln’s Inn, &amp; practised in Chambers there for several years, but left London at the time he married &amp; resided at Elston.”<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                        <p>This seems conclusive, but how he could have been rich enough is now my puzzle: perhaps his elder brother allowed him to live rent-free, or he must have made much money by the law; for he sent up 3 sons at the same time to Cambridge.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>I do not think it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be worth while to give a portrait of the said Robert Darwin.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Will you have the kindness to tell me what was acreage of the land at Cleatham, formerly belonging to the Darwins?<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>The engraving by Rajon from a picture of me by Owless is greatly admired by judges of etching; but my family do not think it very like. Every peculiarity in my features is exaggerated,—or to speak in plain English every feature is made uglier even than it was made by nature. Rajon sent me 8 copies, &amp; my 7 children have each seized on one. I shall be very happy to give you &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin the remaining one, &amp; will despatch it in a few days after getting a big board.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am told that a good copy cannot be purchased now, except for a fabulous price &amp; I am very sure that so ugly a production is not worth a great price.—</p>
<p>Pray believe me | yours very truly obliged | Ch. Darwin</p>
