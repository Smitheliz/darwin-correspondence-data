<p>The papers will probably have told you of our loss—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; I hope this accounted for, (though so late) my not having answered your kind note about the horse.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>We have so much road work &amp; carting over gravelly paths, that a tendency to foot-soreness would be a fatal objection in a horse for our work, or else we should have jumped at the offer. Our Horses have to go sometimes 25 miles, to bring things from the opposite side of London, &amp; they have to do cart work in London as well, not unfrequently.</p>
<p>My dear Mother died very tranquilly after about 12 days of great distress, but hardly of pain— the long recumbent position had brought on excessive weakness, &amp; thickening of the lungs, that impeded her breathing—&amp; was very trying to bear. My sister from Scotland arrived too late to be recognized; my younger sister was with her Mother.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I cannot tell you how severely we feel the blow— It sounds odd that a man of 55 should feel as if <hi rend="underline">orphaned</hi>, but so it is— No one but a Mother retains a life-long interest in the members of her family, &amp; one that strengthens with their numbers &amp; their age. It may be true enough that a man shall leave father &amp; Mother &amp; cleave to his wife; but his Mother never leaves <hi rend="underline">him</hi> till death. He may divide his affections, she never does.— I do not think that both accumulate affections, whatever one may do.</p>
<p>But what I chiefly feel is, the stimulus withdrawn— my prosperity was her chief joy—&amp; my great joy in prosperity was the pleasure it gave her— for her sake I could put up with personal distinction— at least I feel as if it was for her pleasure that I did so, far more than for all other motives put together.</p>
<p>I return to Torquay on Monday for the funeral on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ever my dear Mrs Darwin | most sincerely Yours | J D Hooker</p>
