<p>I was rejoiced to see your hand-writing again in your note of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, of which more anon.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I was astonished to see announced about a week ago that you were going to write in Nature an article on me, &amp; this morning I received an advance copy. It is the grandest thing ever written about me, especially as coming from a man like yourself. It has deeply pleased me, particularly some of your side remarks. It is a wonderful thing to me to live to see my name coupled in any fashion with that of Robert Brown.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But you are a bold man, for I am sure that you will be sneered at by not a few botanists.</p>
<p>I have never been so honoured before, &amp; I hope it will do me good &amp; make me try to be as careful as possible; &amp; good Heavens how difficult accuracy is. I feel a very proud man, but I hope this won’t last.— I received &amp; read your articles in the Nation &amp; G. Chronicle, &amp; very interesting they were to me; but I could not conceive, (as I read them first in the G. Ch.) who could have written them.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> What you tell me about the trail of sweet exudation in Sarracenia beats even Orchids!<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am now hard at work getting my book on Drosera &amp;c. ready for Printers, but it will take some time for I am always finding out new points to observe.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I think you will be interested by my observations on the digestive process in Drosera; the secretion contains an acid of the acetic series &amp; some ferment closely analogous to, but not identical with pepsin; for I have been making a long series of comparative trials. No human being will believe what I shall publish about the smallness of the doses of phosphate of ammonia which act.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Day before Yesterday I found out that Pinguicula digests &amp; then absorbs animal matter; I know that this holds good for albumen, gelatin &amp; insects, but I am now in the midst of my observations.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I began reading the Madagascan squib quite gravely, &amp; when I found it stated that Felis &amp; Bos inhabited Madagascar, I thought it was a false story, &amp; did not perceive it was a hoax till I came to the woman.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I had heard before of the wolf story,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> &amp; know not what to think of these reiterated statements.</p>
<p>When you have any communication with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rood will you thank him much for the sketch of the ears: I have been glad to see the account, but it is too late for use, as I have finished correcting the early sheets for a new Edit. of the Descent. I have been forced to say that I do not feel so confident about the “Darwinische ohr-spitze” as the German calls them, as I was before.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Give our kindest remembrances to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Gray. My wife &amp; self have our game of backgammon every evening &amp; I often think of the scene between you &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Gray.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> My wife threatens me sometimes if I triumph too much—</p>
<p>My dear Gray | Yours gratefully &amp; proudly | Ch. Darwin</p>
