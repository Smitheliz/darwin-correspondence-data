<p rend="left">of individual sterility in Orchids. I have <hi rend="underline">unfortunately</hi> <hi rend="underline">failed</hi> in giving illustrations from <hi rend="underline">genera</hi> distinct from those mentioned in my paper.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> This would have enhanced their interest; my experiments are so much limited here from want of subjects; our orchid collection being exceedingly poor.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I can give you no information whatever as to origin of our <hi rend="underline">Red</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">White</hi> Primroses.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have asked several old and experienced growers as to this: I find that all agree in regarding them as varieties of the common yellow; but, none can affirm that he has raised either from a <hi rend="underline">perfectly pure</hi> yellow primrose. It is possible they may have such an origin as you suspect. If I be permitted, however, to lay any stress upon my experiments, they appear to me somewhat opposed to this.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Thus though both varieties manifest curious idiosyncrasies in the production of seed when fertilised with own-pollen, individuals of both, nevertheless do as I have proved, occasionally produce seed. Hence if we admit them to be crosses; or hybrids between <hi rend="underline">cowslips</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">primroses</hi>; ought we not naturally to look for an <hi rend="underline">increased fertility</hi> from <hi rend="underline">conjunctions</hi> with <hi rend="underline">either</hi> of their presumed <hi rend="underline">parents</hi>? This not being the case I had concluded before you had suggested the above that they were truly &amp; simply <hi rend="doubleUnderline">modified descendants</hi> of the common yellow primrose. Since I have procured seeds from them, however, there are hopes for enlightenments on this. Perhaps you would like to try results. I therefore enclose a few seeds from both.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am sorry that I had no more by me, having sown all as I gathered them to economise time in the elicitation of evidence. One of the packets of Red you will observe queried; this may chance to be from the <hi rend="underline">White</hi> variety; having neglected to name when I gathered contents: you may rely on their being from one or other of same however. I have only a single capsule left—<hi rend="underline">certainly</hi>—sowed from the White variety likewise enclosed: I will send young plants, however, if I succeed in raising them.</p>
<p>I enclose also a few self-fertilised seeds of my equal stamened &amp; styled Cowslip: perhaps you will like to see their results likewise.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The great self-fertility of this plant conjoined with the high degree of sterility from unions with the other forms has surprised me much.</p>
<p>I am greatly obliged for your interesting tables on crosses between Cowslips &amp; primroses.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I was much struck with results of the crosses between long-styled Cowslips &amp; Primroses. These eight flowers <hi rend="underline">heteromorphicaly</hi> crossed produced no seeds, while from the same number of <hi rend="doubleUnderline">homomorphic</hi> crosses I had three capsules, containing respectively 17, 10 &amp; 6 seeds: they—the seeds—were all—seeds— smaller than usual. I have sown them, however &amp; we will see how they germinate. Is it not singular how the homomorphic should so exceed the heteromorphic?<ref target="#foot.f9"/> In your reciprocal cross—Primrose female—I see the heteromorphic cross is again abortive! Again how singularly productive your short-styled crosses are!<ref target="#foot.f10"/> The <hi rend="doubleUnderline">average</hi> production <hi rend="underline">per capsule</hi> of my <hi rend="underline">heteromorphic</hi> unions with <hi rend="doubleUnderline">White</hi> Primroses is about <hi rend="doubleUnderline">21</hi> <hi rend="underline">seeds</hi>: the <hi rend="underline">homomorphic</hi> about <hi rend="underline">13.</hi> I here refer to unions with own-pollen—</p>
<p>I really do not think that there is any fear from imperfect castration when insects are guarded against. I have at least always found as you say when these plants were so protected that no seed was produced even when the anthers were all allowed to remain.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>The plants of <hi rend="underline">Linum Lewisii</hi>, with us have all turned out L. <hi rend="underline">Libericum</hi> which has provoked me much.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> But, I have now got one plant which I am satisfied from description in Bot. Mag. is really L. Lewisii.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> But though I have watched every flower, there is no variation, all are <hi rend="doubleUnderline">short-styled</hi>. I have just had a note from a friend,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> however to call and see a plant of it which he informs me is producing in general <hi rend="underline">short</hi>-styled flower, with others—occasionally sta. &amp; sty. equal. This I will call and see. I trust it may prove so. I have looked over the specimens in the Herbaria here but they contain few specimens of it: they exhibit no traces however, of Planchon’s trimorphic characteristics<ref target="#foot.f15"/>   Have you had any confirmatory evidence? Have you seen the <hi rend="underline">Linum Mongynum</hi>, a <hi rend="underline">dimorphic</hi> species? I find a long-styled plant of this singularly productive, and there is no <hi rend="underline">short-styled</hi> plant near, indeed I have only seen dried specimens of the latter. The majority of the capsules produced by the former contained <hi rend="doubleUnderline">10</hi> apparently good seed—&amp; this is the full number that it can possibly produce.</p>
<p>I am kept very busy at present; so pray excuse my hurried scrawl.</p>
<p>I remain | Sir | Yours very respectfully | J. Scott</p>
