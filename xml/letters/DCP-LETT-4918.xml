<p>Our chairman has been asking me what I thought would be a fair allowance to his son Harry at Cambridge to cover everything.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> He has hitherto paid college expenses, bills &amp;c himself, but Harry tells me his father from his antecedents has not the remotest idea of what is really necessary or unnecessary and the Chairman says he would much rather let Harry make his own arrangements if he knew what would be a proper &amp; reasonable sum to allow him— Carpmael tells me he pays the bills himself &amp; gives his son what he wants—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It has occurred to me that having had the experience of two at Cambridge you would be able to arrive at a very sound conclusion on this knotty point—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; from what I have the pleasure of knowing of both of them, that neither would be extravagant or in any way likely to give a wrong result—</p>
<p>I was very glad to see George &amp; hope he will look me up at Christmass.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I was very sorry to hear from him that your health was still so bad but hope you are improving again—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I must apologise for giving you so much trouble but I know M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin or your daughter will kindly take pen in hand &amp; write the figures which you will advise them—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
