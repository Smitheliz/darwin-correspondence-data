<p>You have been very good about writing, for we like so much to hear all about the place &amp; your companions &amp;c.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I suppose the country is flat &amp; ugly; so I fancy all Norfolk is, but I never entered the county.— It looks here, as if you would have skating, which would be a good job.—</p>
<p>You must know that I have determined to sell the grey mare;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> for the other day she started so violently in the tax-cart &amp; ran up a bank that she very nearly upset the cart.— I shall try M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards &amp; offer her for 25£.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Perhaps you will say, as Lenny did yesterday to Mamma, “Well that is cool to bag my chair”.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It will not be worth while to buy for Easter, without something very good turned up, but we must look out before the summer holidays; indeed it is very inconvenient for us being with only one horse.—</p>
<p>As Norfolk is near Suffolk, look out for me, whether there are near you any Suffolk Punches or large Cart-Horses of a <hi rend="underline">Chesnut</hi> colour; if so please observe whether they have a dark stripe or band down the spine to root of tail; also for mere chance, whether any trace of a cross stripe on the shoulder, where the Donkey has, &amp; any cross-stripes on the legs.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Next Tuesday we all go up to London for a few days; the little Boys, however, not coming up till Wednesday &amp; we all stay till Saturday; Mamma &amp; Etty, however, a few days longer.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The little chaps are very full of the Conjurer, Astley &amp; all.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Thank goodness Lenny has been quite hearty of late.</p>
<p>Lewis has very nearly finished everything in the new rooms, &amp; I must have the Surveyor down &amp; pay for all.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> We have sent the Barberini vase<ref target="#foot.f10"/> up to London by Uncle Harry, who was here on Saturday &amp; Sunday,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> to see whether we can sell it for a good price; &amp; if we can, will it not be good for buying some nice Water-Colour drawings &amp; framed with a good margin, &amp; some of the best in the old drawing-room likewise new framed, will make the new Drawing Room look stunning.— After you have been some little time at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wilson’s, I shall like to hear how you get on with Mathematicks &amp; Classics.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">George Edwards, from whom the grey mare had been purchased, was a horse breeder who lived in Bromley Common, close to Down. He is listed in CD’s Address book (Down House MS).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Also known as the Portland vase, the Barberini vase was a Wedgwood copy of the famous antique Roman vase purchased by the Duchess of Portland in 1784. The particular vase mentioned by CD was probably one of two owned by the family and may have been the one he acquired in 1844 following the death of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> father <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5026.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Josiah Wedgwood II</ref> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 3, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-833.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Susan Darwin, [27 November 1844?]</ref>). The vase was sold for £75 on 3 April 1858 (CD’s Account book (Down House MS)). Another Barberini vase, which had come to CD through his father Robert Waring Darwin, was given by CD to the Museum of Practical Geology later in his life (Meteyard 1875, pp. 302–5).</note>
