<p>I cannot sufficiently thank you for your kindness in sending me a copy of your paper on the Dimorphic states of Primula.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I had eagerly listened to all I could hear on this subject last year, and had devoured the long report of the paper in the Gard: Chron:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> transferring to my note book all the leading points. Highly as I shall value the paper for its own sake I shall prize it a great deal more highly as coming from yourself.</p>
<p>Did D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker<ref target="#foot.f3"/> ever tell you of the division of the sexes in Bilbergia bivittata? This genus is, of course, normally hermaphrodite but in the specimen which flowered at Kew the sexes alternated—i.e. only one flower opened each day and they were alternately male &amp; female. In the male flower the pistil was quite abortive, almost wanting, and in the female blossoms I believe the stamens were altogether wanting and the style exserted. I pointed it out to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Fitch who made sketches of both states,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but whether the circumstance was noticed when the plant was figured in the Bot: Mag: (tab 5270) is more than I can say, for I never see the magazine now.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I have more than once formed the idea of writing to ask if there were any experiments I could carry on for you here, or if I could in any way assist you; but always lacked the courage to carry out the idea— your kindness has however given me confidence. If there be any way in which I can be of service to you I hope and beg you will do me the favour of telling me. I have now a little garden of my own, but no glass-houses at present, and I am in hopes that a little out-of-door exercise will aid me in recovering my strength. While at Kew there were many little things which, under the direction of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker or Prof. Oliver,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I was enabled to observe. As far as circumstances admit I am now at your service and if there be anything which I can observe for you, or any experiments which I am competent to perform I shall be most delighted to do it. It will indeed be a labour of love with me, as you will easily understand if, as you doubtless have, you have heard my character from my friends at Kew.—</p>
<p>There are many British Orchids in our neighbourhood but I suppose you are now satisfied with your observations upon them as I see by one of the Reviews that your work upon them is now ready for the press.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
