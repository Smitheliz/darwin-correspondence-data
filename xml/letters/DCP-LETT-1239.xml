                <div type="transcription">
<p>The very next morning after posting my last letter (I think on 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of March)<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I received your two interesting gossipaceous &amp; geological letters; &amp; the latter I have since exchanged with Lyell for his.— I will write higglety-pigglety just as subject occurs.— I saw the Review in the Athenæum,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> it was written in an illnatured spirit, but the whole virus consisted in saying that there was not novelty enough in your remarks for publication. No one, now a days, cares for reviews; I may just mention that my Journal got some <hi rend="underline">real good</hi> abuse, “presumption” &amp;c. &amp; ended with saying that the volume appeared “made up of the scraps &amp; rubbish of the author’s portfolio”.—</p>
<p>I most truly enter into what you say &amp; quite believe you that you care only for the review with respect to your Father; &amp; that this <hi rend="underline">alone</hi> would make you like to see extracts from your letters more properly noticed in the same periodical. I have considered to the very best of my judgment whether any portions of your present letters are adapted for the Athenæum (in which I have no interest; the beasts not having even <hi rend="underline">noticed</hi> my 3 Geolog: volumes which I had sent to them) &amp; I have come to the conclusion it is better not to send them: I feel sure, considering all the circumstances, that without you took pains &amp; wrote <hi rend="underline">with care</hi> a condensed &amp; finished sketch of some striking feature in your travels, it is better not to send anything. These two letters, are moreover, rather too geological for the Athenæum &amp; almost require woodcuts.— On the other hand there are hardly enough details for a communication to the Geolog. Soc.—</p>
<p>I have not the <hi rend="underline">smallest doubt</hi> that your facts are of the highest interest with regard to Glacial action in the Himmalaya, but it struck both Lyell &amp; myself that your evidence ought to have been given more distinctly; describing for instance any one moraine (if moraines they are) &amp; stating whether any of the boulders are scored or perched, or the underlying rocks polished or scored; whether the latter are mamillated &amp;c; &amp; positively whether some of the largest boulders are from <hi rend="underline">distant</hi> rocks in situ. Again I cannot make out whether your Glacial deposits lie far (&amp; how far?) beneath existing glacial action; which is of course the most interesting point with respect to the glacial action of Europe.— If you can remember it, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be <hi rend="underline">really</hi> curious to hear how this is whenever you write. Lyell thinks that your lakes are connected with old Glacial action; but I do not see how.— At first I thought that your Terraces were curiously like those which I have described in my Geolog. vol. in detail in the Cordillera, &amp; which I have no doubt are of ancient marine origin; but your singular lakes quite puzzle me.— Your terraces are not described sufficiently in detail, viz the state, size &amp; nature of the pebbles; <hi rend="underline">the kind of</hi> <hi rend="underline">stratification</hi> &amp; whether there are layers of sand or clay occasionally intercalated. &amp;c.— Do the rivers after cutting through terraces <hi rend="underline">generally</hi> reach the hard underlying rocks? With respect to the red clay over the mountains; can it be gneiss decomposed in situ, as happens to so surprising a thickness in Brazil?; I suppose not, as you state that it lies on your terraces.</p>
<p>Altogether your excursion amidst the snow-heights must have been very grand; I fear, however, that Botanically it can hardly have repaid you the immense fatigue; how fortunate it is that your health stands so well &amp; Heaven grant this may continue.—</p>
<p>I forgot to say that I will carefully preserve all your letters: none have been destroyed, but those portions which did not contain any facts which I wanted to refer to again have been spitted &amp; the other parts put in my portfolios, but half-an-hour’s work will get them all together &amp; it shall be done on my return home.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I have written so lately that I have nothing to say about myself; my health prevented me going on with a crusade against “mihi” &amp; “nobis” of which you warn me of the dangers: I showed my paper to 3 or 4 naturalists &amp; they all agreed with me to a certain extent: with health &amp; vigor, I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not have shown a white feather, but with aid of <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> a dozen really good naturalists, I believe something might have been done against the miserable &amp; degrading passion of mere naming species.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> In your letter you wonder what “Ornamental Poultry” has to do with Barnacles; but do not flatter yourself that I shall not yet live, to finish the Barnacles &amp; then make a fool of myself on the subject of Species, under which head ornamental Poultry are very interesting.— Thank you much for all your news about Falconer: his conduct does seem really most inexplicable &amp; lamentable: it is a thousand pities.—</p>
<p>In my last letter I said I had not read your Coal Paper,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> because I had not yet borrowed the Volume: that same evening lo &amp; behold I found your Paper amongst my Books: when starting &amp; packing for this place I received the parcel from your Father &amp; somehow overlooked the Coal Paper in a manner, which I cannot even now understand. I have read it with the <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi> interest. Your preliminary remarks strike me as excellent, as well as your various discussions. What beautiful Plates!— I remember in conversation you said you thought that the upright Coal flora might have been fresh-water <hi rend="underline">aquatic</hi>; I regret you did not strongly insert this, for it strikes me as removing some of the geological difficulties &amp; as agreeing so well with your curious facts about the seeds in the hollow trunks: Why on earth sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not the fern-leaves have been drifted to the spot where the upright vegetables grew?— But my Paper is full— Farewell, all success attend you.—</p>
<p>Your’s affectionately. C. Darwin.</p>
