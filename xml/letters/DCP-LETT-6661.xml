<p>I have received your two letters of Mar. 2nd and 5th; and I really do not know how to thank you enough for your extraordinary kindness and energy.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am glad to hear that the inhabitants notice the power of the Drosophyllum to catch flies, for this is the subject of my studies. I have observed during several years the manner in which this is effected, and the results produced in several species of Drosera, and in the wonderful American Dionæa, the leaves of which catch insects just like a steel rat-trap.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Hence I was most anxious to learn how the Drosophyllum would act, so that the Director of the Royal Gardens at Kew wrote some years ago to Portugal to obtain specimens for me, but quite failed.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> So you see what a favour you have conferred on me. With Drosera it is nothing less than marvellous how minute a fraction of a grain of any nitrogenised matter the plant can detect; and how differently it behaves when matter not containing Nitrogen of the same consistence, whether fluid or solid, is applied to the glands. It is also exquisitely sensitive to a weight of even the <hi rend="superscript">1/70,000</hi> of a grain. From what I can see of the glands on <hi rend="underline">Drosophyllum</hi> I suspect that I shall find only the Commencement, or nascent state of the wonderful capacities of the <hi rend="underline">Drosera</hi>, and this will be eminently interesting to me. My MS on this subject has been nearly ready for publication during some years, but when I shall have strength and time to publish I know not.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> And now to turn to other points in your letter: I am quite ignorant of ferns and cannot name your specimen.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The variability of ferns passes all bounds. With respect to your Laugher Pigeon, if the same with the two sub-breeds which I kept, I feel sure from the structure of the skeleton, &amp;c. that it is a descendant of <hi rend="underline">C. Livia.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f6"/> In regard to Beauty I do not feel the difficulty which you and some others experience. In the last Edit. of my <hi rend="underline">Origin</hi> I have discussed the question, but necessarily very briefly.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> A new and I hope amended edit. of the <hi rend="underline">Origin</hi> is now passing thro’ the press, and will be published in a month or two, and it will give me great pleasure to send you a copy.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Is there any place in London where parcels are received for you, or shall I send it by post? With reference to dogs’ tails no doubt you are aware that a rudimentary stump is regularly inherited by certain breeds of sheep dogs, and by manx cats.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> You speak of a change in the position of the axis of the earth: this is a subject quite beyond me, but I believe the Astronomers reject the idea. Nevertheless I have long suspected that some periodical astronomical or cosmical cause must be the agent of the incessant oscillations of level in the earth’s crust. About a month ago I suggested this to a man well capable of judging but he could not conceive any such agency; he promised however to keep it in mind.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I wish I had time and strength to write to you more fully. I had intended to send this letter off at once, but on reflection, will keep it till I receive the plants.</p>
<p>With the most sincere thanks for your very great kindness I remain dear Sir | yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. 2nd. Did you ever see my little Book on the Fertilisation of Orchids by Insect Agency: the facts are really curious. If you have it not, shall I send you a copy? Do you think you would care about the Nat. Hist. and wonderful spontaneous movement of Climbing Plants. I wrote a little pamphlet on this subject— should you care for it?<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>

<p rend="left">My dear Sir</p>
<p>I have been anxiously expecting the plants for several days, but I suppose the ship was delayed by northern winds. At last they have just arrived; but most unfortunately the weather for the last week has been very cold, and the soil in the pots had become as dry as dust on a road, and the poor plants have suffered greatly. Some, however, look so green in the centre that I fully expect that they will recover; if only 2 or 3 leaves will grow, and the glands secrete the viscid fluid, I shall be able to make my observations, to which I look forward with great interest, for the whole structure is very different from Drosera.— I have had long consultations with my gardener,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; we mean to treat them in different ways, &amp; carefully observe what suits best.— I have hopes of deep pot kept dry in upper part, but standing in shallow saucer with water. I have put them in greenhouse, &amp; will then try a warmer house on a few, &amp; so on, for I have 4 Houses of different temperatures. I do hope that some will revive: if 2 or 3 revive I will give one to the Royal Bot. Garden at Kew, where it will be treasured. How wonderfully kind you have been, &amp; what trouble you have taken in packing them. Not one pot broken!! This dreadful cold frost has been most unfortunate.—</p>
<p>Yours <hi rend="underline">most truly</hi> obliged | C. Darwin</p>
