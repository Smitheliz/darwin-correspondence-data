<p>A Mr A. J. Gower, HRH Consul at Nagasaki Japan called on me today, &amp; I had an hour’s chat with him—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> He knows all about the Ainios, &amp; is going back to their part of Japan—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have given away all the copies of your queries regarding expression:<ref target="#foot.f3"/>—if you think it worth the while you can send one to Mr Gower (I told him possibly you would) 9 Via della Madonna, Leghorn, whither he goes on Monday &amp; thence to Japan in a month— He will take Tylor’s &amp; Lubbock’s books with him,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; make observations: it was he who had to restore the Ainio Skulls stolen by Col: Vyse &amp; the collector, Whiteley. some years ago.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I did see the “Tiger” &amp; was much amused.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The Pall-Mall rather nettled me, partly because it was right, but more because it evidently sought out the weak point—to display smart criticism, The comparison of Religion to Science, &amp; calling both <hi rend="underline">opinions</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="doubleUnderline">nothing more</hi>, was too absurd. &amp; made no allusion to the rest of the address.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> It was also unfairly stated— I did not call <hi rend="underline">all</hi> Natural Theology false (whatever I thought)<ref target="#foot.f8"/> nor do all Brit. Ass. addresses, as a matter of course, wind up with religion &amp; science.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Owen is indeed an awful ass; there was a lie, direct or indirect, in every paragraph of his article, &amp; yet even this does not rile me with Owen— A man who can so deceive himself, as to believe that no fraud of his own is too gross to be seen through, as long as it is <hi rend="underline">his</hi> own, is surely beyond exciting pity or contempt or any other human passion.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I shall meet him just the same, &amp; be hugely tempted to broach the subject bluntly to him. Was it you who told me that Carlyle called his smile “Sugar of lead”.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Asa Gray’s come straight to lodgings which I have taken for them here. she will be knocked up he thinks— it will be jolly to go to Down with them<ref target="#foot.f12"/>—but I doubt her standing the excitement; I fear she is either over exciteable or melancholic. the latter I suspect.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Have you seen the Pall Malls inuendo apropos of the Cathedral Anthem at Norwich &amp; me— it is all bosh.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Buck, the organist—, gave it out of a real compliment—to me &amp; I am sure I accepted it as such &amp; enjoyed it <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> though I must confess I at first thought myself a huge egotist to suppose it was intended for me:—it was lovely &amp; the Pall Mall may be d—d.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>

The consul at Hakodate from 1862 to 1865, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_6940.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Howard Vyse</ref>, had apparently directed the theft in the hope of selling the bones for a profit; the skeletons were shipped to England, possibly by Vyse, who resigned his position in December 1866. In May 1867, boxes containing the bones were returned to Hakodate and forwarded to the Ainu village of Mori, from which they had been stolen. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3694.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hoare 1975</ref>.

            <note xml:id="foot.f9">The <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, 22 August 1868, p. 1, claimed that presidential addresses at meetings of the British Association ended ‘almost invariably with some sort of disquisition upon the relations between science and religion’.</note>

Dr. Hooker could not sing his reply, and the Cathedral authorities thus cleverly stole a march upon him. A man cannot very well answer a clergyman in the pulpit, and to put one’s views in the form of an anthem and chant it oneself is a still greater impossibility. Dr. Hooker was silenced, if not convinced. </quote> <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_7152.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Zechariah Buck</ref> was the master of the choristers at Norwich cathedral; the anthem is an aria from George Frideric Handel’s oratorio <hi rend="italic">Solomon.</hi> See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-6333.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 30 August 1868</ref>.</note>
