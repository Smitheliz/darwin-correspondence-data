<p>I am very much obliged for your kind letter, and I have waited for a week before answering it, in hopes of receiving the “Kleine Schrift” to which you allude; but I fear it is lost, which I am much surprised at, as I have seldom failed to receive any thing sent by the post.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>As I do not know the title and cannot order a copy; I should be very much obliged if you can spare another.</p>
<p>I am delighted that you, with whose name I am familiar, should approve of my work. I entirely agree with what you say about each species varying according to its own peculiar laws; but at the same time it must, I think, be admitted, that the variations of most species have in the lapse of ages been extremely diversified; for I do not see how it can be otherwise explained that so many forms have acquired analogous structures for the same general object, independently, of descent. I am very glad to hear that you have been arguing against Nägeli’s law of perfectibility which seems to me superfluous.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Others hold similar views, but none of them define what this “perfection” is, which cannot be gradually attained through Natural Selection. I thought M. Wagner’s first pamphlet (for I have not yet had time to read the second) very good and interesting; but I think that he greatly overrates the necessity for emigration and isolation.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I doubt whether he has reflected on what must occur when his forms colonize a new country, unless they vary during the very first generation; nor does he attach, I think, sufficient weight to the cases of what I have called unconscious selection by man;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> in these cases races are modified by the preservation of the best and the destruction of the worst, without any isolation.</p>
<p>I sympathize with you most sincerely, on the state of your eye-sight;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> it is indeed the most fearful evil which can happen to any one who like yourself is earnestly attached to the pursuit of natural knowledge.</p>
<p>With the most sincere respect pray believe me | dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>
