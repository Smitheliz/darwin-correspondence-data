<p>I have been thinking over the Ray Soc. business,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; it seems to me so improper that my advances of <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>117, during the last 2–3 years to pay M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Sowerby should never have been mentioned to the Council, that I hope that you will bring forward the case, &amp; you can say very truly that I asked you when I was going to be paid &amp; was surprised to find that you knew nothing about it.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Moreover it strikes me that it rather deeply concerns you personally, for if you were to get Royal Soc. money &amp; the Ray Soc became bankrupt it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be an awkward affair for you.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> There may be other debts besides mine.—</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">As I feel under great obligations to the Ray Soc, which I beg you</hi> <hi rend="underline">to express on my part</hi>, I would not for the world do anything troublesome or unfair towards the Society.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Huxley, a member of the council of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3945.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ray Society</ref>, had apparently mentioned to CD during his visit to Down in April that owing to the failure of a number of members to pay their subscriptions and to over-publication, the society was facing bankruptcy. In 1857, however, the situation began to improve through withdrawing the names of non-paying members and increasing the number of new members (‘Report of the council of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3945.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ray Society</ref>’, 2 September 1857, bound into the copy of T. H.

CD had paid him on behalf of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3945.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ray Society</ref> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 5, letters to J. S.

The <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3945.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ray Society</ref> repaid CD £67 on 21 November 1857. An entry in his Account book (Down House MS) reads: ‘<ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3945.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ray Society</ref>. Part repayment 50<hi rend="superscript">£</hi> due.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Huxley had made repeated attempts, after returning from the voyage of the <hi rend="italic">Rattlesnake</hi>, to obtain funds from the Admiralty for the publication of his work on marine invertebrates. Only after resigning his commission in 1854 was he awarded £300 from the government grant administered by the Royal Society. The <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3945.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ray Society</ref> undertook to publish the work, but this was delayed until 1859 owing to Huxley’s ‘heavy official duties’ and the great number of other publications undertaken by the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3945.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ray Society</ref> in the intervening years.
