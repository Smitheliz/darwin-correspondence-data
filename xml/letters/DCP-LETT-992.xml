<p>Thanks RM for "Dynamics of earthquakes" [<hi rend="italic">Trans. R. Irish Acad.</hi> 21 (1848): 50–106]. It has cleared up his ideas on undulations. Now wishes he had said nothing about them in <hi rend="italic">Journal of researches</hi>. Sends his paper ["Certain volcanic phenomena in S. America", <hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi> 1: 53–86]. Wishes RM would investigate Chile. Speculates whether earthquakes coincide with moon or tides.</p>

                <div type="transcription">
<p>I take the liberty of writing to thank you for your most obliging present of the Dynamics of Earthquakes, &amp; for the much too honourable mention you make of my name.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have read your memoir with the <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi> interest &amp; it has much cleared my ideas, though undulations of all kinds will ever be of difficult comprehension to non-mathematical heads.—</p>
<p>During writing the first Edition of my Journal, I consulted M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Whewell,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; soon perceived how difficult a subject that of waves was. In the Col. Library Edit, I condensed what I had said, &amp; now heartily wish I had said nothing for I felt at the time that I was out of my depth.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I beg to send you a paper of mine, which perhaps you may never seen &amp; may be scarcely worth your reading; my chief object in writing it, was to show the intimate connection &amp; indeed identity of the forces, which pour forth lava &amp; elevate continents: this to my mind is an important conclusion.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> At p. 621. you will see an indirect argument against Earthquakes being undulations in an underlying fluid mass &amp; in favour, (of what your memoir will never again allow to be doubtful) of their being a vibration or oscillation in the solid crust.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Have you seen the M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Rogers of N. America papers on earthquakes,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> they push the doctrine of fluid undulations to a monstrous extent, &amp; if I might take the liberty to suggest, it would be adviseable to send a copy of your memoir to them; for they are <hi rend="underline">excellent</hi> geologists.</p>
<p>How wonderfully interesting it would be, if you could have your instrument<ref target="#foot.f8"/> worked in Chile: in Lima, there was or is a merchant M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Maclean<ref target="#foot.f9"/> with a strong taste for Natural History, &amp; earthquakes are frequent there.</p>
<p>I have some intentions of being at Southampton,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> &amp; I trust, you will allow me to introduce myself to you.</p>
<p>With my sincere thanks | I beg to remain dear Sir | Yours faithfully | C. Darwin</p>
<p>It has often occurred to me that a faithful record of earthquakes in Chile, would perhaps afford curious results from coincidences with the moon or state of tides.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>

Mallet also explained numerous aspects of tidal waves as the result of the different velocities of wave propagation in the rock of the sea-bed, the water, and the air above (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5174.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Mallet 1846</ref>, pp. 65–74).</note>
