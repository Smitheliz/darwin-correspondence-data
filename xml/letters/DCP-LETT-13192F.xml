<p>Many thanks for your letter &amp; for Dubbas.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I enclose a nice letter from Elfving which will interest you; it is very nice of him immediately to tell me something he is at &amp; has not published—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I will try &amp; find out about eosin &amp; fuchsin, I remember the paper; both those you could get from Martindale<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>I spoke to deBary &amp; he seemed to think protoplasm must have been dead but I think it was seen to move coloured.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Wortmann says deBary thinks Van Tieghem a humbug as did Stahl also, almost dishonest I fancy<ref target="#foot.f6"/>   de Bary is not a bit like Sachs in the way of thinking every body fools.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>The scientific public seems to feel H Müllers Alpen blumen like Carpenter Deep Sea, de Bary says he must take several years rest before he reads it there have been so many notices of it mostly be Müller himself.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I want to know whether you think the false circumnutation produced by the clock worth publishing. It wont be published for a month so I have time but should like to know what you think; I think I shall publish the paper in a shorter form with much fewer diagrams than as I wrote it out: I don’t feel satisfied with so many of the diagrams—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I am tired so goodbye | Yr affec | F. D.</p>

Both men were studying movement in the fungus <hi rend="italic">Phycomyces nitens</hi>. The letter from Elfving has not been found, but may have been on the subject of Elfving’s observation of an avoidance response in the fungus (see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13166F.xml">letter from Francis Darwin, 19 [May 1881]</ref> and n. 3).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Francis was working in the laboratory of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1268.xml">Anton de Bary</ref>. De Bary was probably referring to the toxic effect of colouring agents on protoplasm of the cell membrane, as described in Cornu and Mer 1878.</note>
