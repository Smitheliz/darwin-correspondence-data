<p>I sent my Boys hunting for Lepisma, but they only brought an Isopod with long tail.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I will myself go soon &amp; hunt, but I have had a bad day or two. By the way the cause was a too long visit to Wollaston, which at the time I much enjoyed, but paid for.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He has a very nice little house &amp; is working hard; but his life is sadly too solitary. He has not a naturalist to associate with. He seems pretty strong, but looks fearfully delicate.—</p>
<p>I pity you about S. &amp; W. but one always feels those sorts of blunders most oneself.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I will send 3 guineas soon to Essay Fund:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I ought to give 5, but I feel too stingy &amp; with my party of 18 money goes like water. My Brother, who is here, will subscribe &amp; I daresay will give five guineas.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have had another awfully long letter from my Lawyer, who says the other Lawyer does not understand him: confound them both;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I suppose they will agree soon. The points seem to me of very little importance.</p>
<p>Pray do not say that if the life does not suit William you shall reproach yourself: nobody could possibly have been kinder than you have been or given more cautious advice.—</p>
<p>My wife &amp; Etty are gone for a little tour of a week to the higher lands of Dartmoor<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Goodnight | My dear Lubbock | Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | I grieve to say that since above was written I have had a long letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hacon. He wants very much to see you again, &amp; I have venture to say that he might call on you tomorrow (<hi rend="underline">Saturday</hi>) or Monday &amp; get your opinion.— My judgment being almost worthless, on these points makes the negotiations wonderfully difficult.— God knows whether M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hacon is too particular; but without your aid it is clear to me the whole affair will be smashed; &amp; I cannot but fear that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Atherley’s patience (<hi rend="underline">&amp; yours</hi>) will be utterly exhausted. Yet it seems that it would be madness on my part to tell my solicitor he is giving trouble for no good, as I cannot understand the force of the difficulties.—</p>
