<p>I am ashamed at not having written to you before, &amp; more especially as Aiken gave me some very important messages to you, about Cocks &amp; Hens,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> no less than ten days ago: Imprimis, there are two hatches: no mother: price of larger 3<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> each &amp; of the lesser chickens 2"6. He is afraid you will think them very dear, but could not get them cheaper.—</p>
<p>I am sure you will be very sorry to hear, that my Father has been very ill, but is now I hope steadily but slowly getting better: The cause of his illness is a deep seated Erysipelus in his neck, attended with great deal of Fever. I am afraid he has undergone a great deal of suffering: &amp; that it will be some time before he quite recovers the effect of it. I should have gone down to Shrewsbury, only that his Medical attendants particularly insisted that he should be kept as quiet as possible: My sisters appear to have been terribly alarmed, as I suppose on Wednesday he was in imminent danger.—</p>
<p>Erasmus has been staying here for a few days, &amp; we passed the time very pleasantly chiefly in the Fitzwilliam<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; he would have stayed some time longer, only that he went to London, in order to be in readiness to go down to Shrewsbury if my Father should be worse: None of the Cam: Entomologists have done anything to speak of, but I am going to Bottisham to see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Jenyns cabinet, &amp; I believe he is coming to see mine: Professor Henslows<ref target="#foot.f3"/> parties go on very well. the last was the pleasantest I was ever at:</p>
<p>I have been very idle since I have come up, but have had some good hunting: Rob〈in〉son has been riding to th〈e〉 ad〈mir〉at〈ion〉 〈of〉 every body. I think he is the best rid〈er〉 I ever saw.—</p>
<p>I am very sorry that you are so undecided as to when you will come up to Cambridge. I do hope it will eventually take place. I shall go down very early in order to see my Father.—&amp; return early in the next Term to read for my little Go.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>

The collection, to which other donations were added, was temporarily housed in the old Free School in Free School Lane. The present Fitzwilliam Museum building was begun in 1837.</note>
