<p>I shall be very pleased if you find anything in my researches in Crete that will prove of interest to you—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I thought they might at this moment, as Crete is in some degree linked with the Eastern Question—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> So digging some remnant copies out of the dust of my publishers stores I asked our Secretary M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. White to be kind enough to distribute them to the Fellows, as they come to the Royal Society, whose names I had selected, or to send them by Post if they did not put in an appearance—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Therefore I told White to say as they were presented, that I neither expected thanks nor acknowledgement under the circumstances—Merely wanting a place for the volumes upon the shelves of those among the acquaintances or friends however slight, who I thought would thus give them room— I think we have once if not twice met in days past—In the days of poor Edward Forbes—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> That, and more especially your connection—distinguished connection with the Old Surveying Branch of the Service, as it was under Beaufort! induced me to desire to offer you a set—as you troubled yourself to write, and already shewn that the illustrations have attracted your attention, it has pleased and gratified<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Yours faith<hi rend="superscript">ly</hi>. | T Spratt</p>

Spratt had been captain of HMS <hi rend="italic">Spitfire</hi>, in which he began a survey of Crete in 1851.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">The ‘Eastern Question’ referred to the problems posed by the Ottoman Empire as its hold over the Balkans weakened; it dated from the late eighteenth century, when the empire was defeated in the Russo-Turkish war of 1768–74. Rebellion against the Ottoman Empire was ongoing in many Balkan regions in the 1860s and 70s and there had been a revolt against the empire in Crete from 1866 to 1868 (for more on European attitudes to the Ottoman Empire in the nineteenth century, see Kent ed. 1984).</note>

Forbes had provided CD with specimens for <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2622.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Fossil Cirripedia</hi> (1854)</ref>, for which he was acknowledged in the preface.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_348.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Beaufort</ref> was hydrographer to the navy from 1829 to 1855, during which time he planned and directed numerous surveys (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5933.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).
