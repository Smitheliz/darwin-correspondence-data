        <abstract>
            <p>FD and CD have been interested in AdeC’s diagram for illustrating inheritance. The difficulty of estimating different qualities in oneself and others is very great. Encloses a diagram illustrating how FD compares himself with his parents. CD has filled in a comparison with his father. It shows he resembles his father more than FD resembles CD. [The qualities compared are: stature, hair, eyes, pulse, musical capacity, ability to draw, tendency toward biological sciences, tendency toward mathematical sciences, perseverence, memory, aptitude for foreign languages.]</p>

                    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
                    <p>I was much pleased at your kindness in remembering the interest which I felt in your method of illustrating inheritance. Both my father &amp; myself have been much interested in examining your diagram<ref target="#foot.f2"/>   It seems to us that the difficulty of estimating the different qualities in oneself or in others is very great. My father tried to compare himself with his father<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but quite failed to determine what qualities he inherited from him. If it were not for this difficulty there is no doubt as it seems to my father &amp; myself that your method would give most interesting results   I venture to send you a diagram showing a way of graphically comparing a man with his parents. It is composed so as to compare myself with my parents, the qualities being in some instances perhaps exaggerated.</p>
                    <p>Since writing the above part of this letter, I have shown the diagram to my father, &amp; he has filled in his father. I think it shows that he resembles my grandfather more than I do my father. I seem to resemble my mother<ref target="#foot.f4"/> in some points.</p>
<p>I remain, with great respect | Yours sincerely | Francis Darwin</p>
