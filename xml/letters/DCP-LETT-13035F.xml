<p>I send you a paper box with leaves in it, they were very sodden &amp; decayed so that they are a poor set.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I took out a plate &amp; some ink, and dipped the end in the ink &amp; laid them on the plate, and afterwards put an atom of vermilion on the inked parts, as I doubted whether the ink would be very distinct   the best are in little box fastened with sealing wax in the bigger one.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I also send several Rhododendron leaves which I found drawn in and apparently stopping up holes.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Underneath these in a paper are some leaves which were tucked in sideways, but I am not quite sure which side was lowest, however they were doubled up as you see them.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I will have another look on Sunday, but I doubt if I shall find any more; so that I hope you will make something out of these; I found a good number of crumbling broken scraps but I found it difficult to say which way they were placed in the holes, as they may have got turned in being pulled out.</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear that you think you will make out the habits satisfactorily.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">This was a collection of leaves that earthworms had pulled into the mouths of their burrows to plug them up at night.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD was ‘wholly rewriting’ his chapter on the habits of worms, and had asked William to check which ends of leaves were pulled into earthworm burrows (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13034.xml">letter to W. E. Darwin, 31 January [1881]</ref>). William marked one end of the leaves with ink to help his observations (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13013.xml">letter to W. E. Darwin, 14 January [1881]</ref>). CD had observed that worms usually drew in leaves by the more streamlined tips rather than by the footstalk (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref>, pp. 64–8).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD became particularly interested in rhododendron leaves after William pointed out that the leaves of some species were narrower at the base than at the apex; they therefore provided a way of testing whether earthworms exhibited intelligence in selecting the end that could be dragged into their burrows most easily (<hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi>, pp. 69–70).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">As leaves were drawn into earthworm burrows, they became closely folded and pressed together (<hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi>, p. 59).</note>
