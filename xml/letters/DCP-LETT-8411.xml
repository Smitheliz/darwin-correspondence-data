<p>I am very much obliged for your kind letter, and delayed only to answer, whilst I could not tell you, if I was to come over to England.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Now I am exceedingly fatigued by practical work, my friend D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Snellen, my partner in practice having been obliged to take a rather long holiday, and I feel that after his return—at the 16 of July—I have to spend a few days quietly near the sea, for seeing if I become able to support the fatigues of a Congress (opthalmological) at the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. of August in London.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Certainly, I hope so, and in the case I come in London, I will be most happy to avail my-self of your kind invitation to pass a day in your house and in your family. So we would find plenty time to speak about some physiological questions, if you like to do so. I suppose that my friend Bowman will like very much to come also.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I think, it is not necessary to tell you again that it will be a pleasure and a great honour to me, at any time, to do for facilitating your physiological studies any thing I am able to do. I am always learning by trying to answer to your questions and I would do it not less by reading over some chapters of your book.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>With the greatest consideration and sincere attachment | Yours very truly | Donders</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Hermann Snellen was an assistant physician at the Netherlands Hospital for Eye Patients (Nederlandsch Gasthuis voor Ooglijders), where Donders was director. The fourth international ophthalmological congress was held in London in early August 1872. Donders attended the congress; his portrait was reproduced as the frontispiece of the <hi rend="italic">Report of the fourth international ophthalmological congress</hi> (1873).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD expected that Donders might visit on either the 30 or 31 July (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8431.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. T. Gulick, 28 July [1872]</ref> and n. 3). Donders, however, did not arrive in London until 30 July; he stayed with <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_571.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Bowman</ref> until probably 7 or 8 August (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8439.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from William Bowman, 31 July 1872</ref>). There is no evidence that they made a visit to Down.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Donders had offered to read the proofs of any part of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2400.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Expression</hi></ref> that referred to physiology (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8290.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from F. C. Donders, 17 April 1872</ref>).</note>
