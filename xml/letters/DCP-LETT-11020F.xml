<p>Many thanks for your letter &amp; the cheque for £5 from your father which reached me here today.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I wrote to Madame Michelet on receiving your former letter to tell her of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin’s intention to join in the subscription &amp; I am sure it will give her &amp; her friends the greatest pleasure.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> There was no one in England, or perhaps in Europe, for whom Jules Michelet had such reverence.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> This feeling of his was so strong that I believe it principally converted Michelet at the close of his life from the unreasonable anti-English tone of his early days. And he used to speak of England as “le pays de Charles Darwin”</p>
<p>We are staying here now (at my fathers) until August.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It is a lovely country, &amp; this is a very fine old house of 1529 in red brick &amp; <hi rend="underline">terracotta</hi>. I have established myself &amp; am working in a room which is a perfect student’s dream. It is a long gallery 90 feet long with mullioned windows, bays &amp;c, lined with old oak pannelling &amp; hung with faded tapestries   It is in a disused wing of the house, &amp; was formerly the chapel. It is like a long gallery in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. I have my table &amp; my books in one of the overhanging bays, &amp; through the lattices on the other side, I get exquisite views over the Dorking hills, the scent of the new mown hay, &amp; the singing of the birds. It is hard to imagine oneself in the XIX<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Century   This gallery has hardly been touched for 3 centuries &amp; there is nothing in it but the old wood carving, tapestries, &amp; some old wooden chests &amp; carved chairs of the time. The only modern thing is some books of science which I have brought up here to work at.</p>
<p>The terrific account of burglars here which the newspapers published on Monday is almost pure invention— there was no fight, no masks, no jewels, no one seen &amp; nothing taken but the sugar tongs.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Two men did get in, but they spent their efforts in trying to force the old mediæval chests &amp; an iron safe of the period which they could not open, &amp; in which there <hi rend="underline">was nothing</hi>.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | Frederic Harrison.</p>
