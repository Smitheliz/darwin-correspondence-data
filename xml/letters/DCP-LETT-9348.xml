<p>Questions correctness of two statements in <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi>: 1. That fulmar petrels are the most numerous birds in the world;</p> 
            <p>2. That the increase of one form of thrush in Scotland has been concomitant with the decline of another form.</p>

<p>I had, curiously enough, been meditating on a letter to you, when this morning I had the pleasure of receiving yours.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot be in London on Monday next or I need scarcely say that I should have been glad to do anything in my power to assist your nephew’s election at the ‘Athenæum’—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> With the claims he possesses however I should suppose that he is very safe.</p>
<p>The point upon which I was going to trouble you was this— In the ‘Origin’ (4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Ed<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. p. 76) you say:—</p>
<p>“the Fulmar petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world”.</p>
<p>Far be it from me to say that the latter assertion is not accurate—but I must confess I would gladly know on what authority it is made—for I take it some authority is to be found though I have not met with it—and I really write for information.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> My own experience would lead me to think otherwise— but I place no particular confidence in it—though even granting that the Fulmars of the North Atlantic of the North Pacific &amp; of the Antarctic Ocean are really of one “species” (each has been described as distinct) your statement seems open to enquiry if not doubt.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>There is also another point on which I would venture to ask for information— You say (<hi rend="underline">op</hi>. <hi rend="underline">cit</hi>. p. 87):—“The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush”— The increased range of the Misseltoe-Thrush is undeniable but I do not know of any authority for the rest of the statement—and I must say that judging from the different habits of the two species I am inclined to suspect that it may be founded on insufficient observation.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>One of the most remarkable instances of the supplanting of one species by another is that which I have mentioned in the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Ed<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. of Yarrell’s ‘British Birds’ which I am now bringing out— Montagu (an excellent authority) &amp; other ornithologists of his day concur in saying that the Marsh Titmouse was commoner than the Coal-Titmouse— Except <hi rend="underline">in a very few localities</hi>, the contrary is now unquestionably the fact, and it is owing I suspect to the increase of fir-plantations, which are not favourable to the Marsh-Titmouse but very much so to its conqueror.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Trusting that you will favour me with a few lines on these subjects I am with kind regards to you &amp; all your family | Yours very truly | Alfred Newton</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9344.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Alfred Newton, 9 March [1874]</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD had been canvassing support for his nephew Henry Parker, who was seeking election to the Athenaeum Club on Monday 16 March 1874 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9347.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to George Bentham, 9 March [1874]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD’s statement was possibly based on the observation by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4140.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Sabine</ref> that the number of fulmar petrels flying northwards over Jacob’s Bay (Iluissat), Greenland, was almost as large as the number of passenger pigeons seen in flights in America (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6830.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sabine 1818</ref>, p. 553). In the early nineteenth century, the passenger pigeon was one of the most numerous birds on earth (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_390.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Barrow 2009</ref>, pp. 96–9).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Newton had seen fulmar petrels during a journey to Iceland in 1858 and again in 1864, when travelling to Spitzbergen (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8450.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1921</ref>, pp. 27, 29, and 82). These northern fulmars, whose range is the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans, had been named <hi rend="italic">Procellaria glacialis</hi> by Linnaeus in 1761. The southern fulmar petrels that are found in the Southern or Antarctic Ocean were first described by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4396.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Andrew Smith</ref> in 1840 and named <hi rend="italic">Procellaria glacialoides</hi> (Andrew <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7242.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Smith 1849</ref>, pt 2, plate 51). They are now called <hi rend="italic">Fulmarus glacialoides</hi>. The genus <hi rend="italic">Fulmarus</hi> has only two species, <hi rend="italic">F. glacialis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">F. glacialoides</hi>; it is in the family Procellariidae.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD had used the information about the relative numbers of the mistle-thrush and the song thrush as evidence for his argument that the struggle for life was most severe between individuals and varieties in the same species (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6017.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> 4th ed.</ref>, p. 87). According to Newton’s revision of the first two volumes of the fourth edition of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5275.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Yarrell’s</ref> <hi rend="italic">History of British birds</hi>, one of the habits in which the song thrush (<hi rend="italic">Turdus philomelos</hi>) differed from the mistle-thrush (<hi rend="italic">Turdus viscivorus</hi>) was in feeding on large snails by breaking their shells (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8553.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Yarrell 1871–85</ref>, 1: 265).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Newton made this observation about the relative numbers of <hi rend="italic">Parus palustris</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Poecile palustris</hi>, the marsh tit) and <hi rend="italic">Parus ater</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Periparus ater</hi>, the coal tit) in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8553.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Yarrell 1871–85</ref>, 1: 491. Newton refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3371.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Montagu</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5542.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Montagu 1802</ref>, vol. 2, s.v. ‘Titmouse–cole’.</note>
