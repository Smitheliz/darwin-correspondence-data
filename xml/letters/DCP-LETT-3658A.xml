            <p>Is obliged for information concerning differences in the bees of Britain. Relates case of the Jamaican bees which were introduced long ago and have remained the same in size and character except that the diameter of the cells is larger, the wax tougher, and the walls of the hive thicker.</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to your several correspondents for their information in regard to the supposed differences in the bees of Britain.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Possibly some few of your readers may be interested in the following case:— The hive bee was introduced many years ago into Jamaica. Having seen it stated that the cells were larger, I procured (through the kindness of Mr. R. Hill, of Spanish Town), some bees and comb.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The bees have been carefully examined by Mr. F. Smith,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> of the British Museum, and pronounced to be the common species. I also secured the hind and front legs, the antennæ and jaws of worker bees from Jamaica and my own stock, and could detect no trace of difference in size or other character. But here comes the remarkable point—the diameter of the cells is conspicuously greater in about the proportion of 60 to 51 or 52 than in our English combs. The wax seems tougher, and the walls, I think, are thicker. The cells in parts of the comb were much elongated, and the whole hive contained a great quantity of honey. It certainly appears as if the instinct of the bee had become modified in relation to its new, hot, and rich home. But it seems to me an astonishing fact that the cells should have been made larger without a corresponding increase in the size of the body of the architect.—</p>
<p>I am well aware that when any person dips into a subject with which he is not familiar he is apt to make great blunders. And this conviction leads me to ask whether the excellent observer <hi rend="italic">[</hi>Mr<hi rend="italic">]</hi> Woodbury<ref target="#foot.f5"/> would like to look at the pieces of combs, the queen, drone &amp; <hi rend="italic">[</hi>worker<hi rend="italic">]</hi>-bees. If he would, I would most gladly &amp; gratefully send the specimens, (carriage paid) to his residence; for I should either get a curious fact established or my error would be corrected. If he will consent to examine them, I hope he will publish a brief note of the result in your Journal<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
