<p>Very many thanks for your kind letter. I have been interested by what you tell me about your views published in 1848, &amp; I wish I could read your Essay.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It is clear to me that you were as near as possible in preceeding me on the subject of natural Selection. You will find very little that is new to you in my last book; whatever merit it may possess consists in the grouping of the facts &amp; in deductions from them. I am now at work on my Essay on Expression.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>My last book fatigued me much &amp; I have had much correspondence, otherwise I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have written to you long ago, as I often intended, to tell you in how high a degree your Essay published in Beale’s Archives interested me.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have heard others express their admiration at the complete manner in which you have treated the subject. Your confirmation of Sir C Bell’s rather loose statement has been of <hi rend="underline">paramount</hi> importance for my work—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>You told me that I might make further enquiries of you. When a person is lost in meditation, his eyes often appear as if fixed on a distant object &amp; the lower eyelids may be seen to contract &amp; become wrinkled. I suppose the idea is quite fanciful, but as you say that the eyeball advances in adaptation for vision for close objects, would the eyeball have to be pushed backwards in adaptation for distant objects? If so can the wrinkling of the lower eyelids, which has often perplexed me, act in pushing back the eyeball? But as I have said I daresay this is quite fanciful. Gratiolet says that the pupil contracts in rage, and dilates enormously in terror.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have not found this great anatomist quite trustworthy on such points, &amp; am making enquiries on this subject. But I am inclined to believe him, as the old Scotch anatomist Munro says that the iris of parrots contract &amp; dilate under passions, independently of the amount of light.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Can you give any explanation of this statement?</p>
<p>When the heart beats hard &amp; quick, &amp; the head becomes somewhat congested with blood in any illness, does the pupil contract? Does the pupil dilate in incipient faintness, or in utter prostration, as when after a severe race a man is pallid, bathed in perspiration, with all his muscles quivering? Or in extreme prostration from any illness?</p>
<p>With cordial thanks for all your kindness and invaluable assistance, | believe me yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
