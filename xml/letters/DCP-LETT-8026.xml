            <p>Glad CD agrees with his views as much as he does. Not surprised that his red rocks [Red Sandstones] ideas are disputed. The red marls of Auvergne support his inland water theory.</p>

<p>I am very glad to find that you so far agree with my views.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am not surprised that my ideas abt the Red rocks are disputed. All theoretical papers are likely to meet with opposition when they do not coincide with established orthodoxy, and I have been very well accustomed to it before in cases that by degrees in 10 or 12 years have gathered many disciples.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Therefore I am not as yet afraid about the ultimate success of the red rock theory, aided as it seems to me to be by other circumstances all pointing to inland waters. I ought to have mentioned in my paper that the red Marles of Auvergne form a case in point.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I believe that the great area of inland drainage in Central Asia presents the nearest existing parallel of the state of parts of the world during Permian &amp; New Red times.</p>
<p>If I could only find time to go to Germany I think I have some very good fish to fry in re the physical state of Europe in part of the Tertiary epoch. At all events I would like to prove to myself whether what I have been brooding on for several years is true or false.</p>
<p>Do not take the trouble to answer this unimportant note.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | And<hi rend="superscript">w</hi> C Ramsay</p>
