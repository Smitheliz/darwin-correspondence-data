<p>I am very much obliged for your kind present of poor Chauncey Wright’s works, received this morning.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It is an exceedingly handsome memorial to him, &amp; one which I cannot doubt he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have preferred to any other. I had no idea that he had written so much.— I have already read with very great interest your account of his remarkable character &amp; attainments; &amp; it makes one bitterly regret his early death.— Some of your remarks, I must add, make me feel not a little proud.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have not much strength for reading, which tires me more than writing, but I will certainly read some of the essays which are new to me &amp; reread some of the old ones. So let me again thank you heartily for your kindness. I trust I may take the publication of this book as a proof that your health is fairly good, &amp; so I hope is that of all your party. Pray give to them all our kind &amp; cordial remembrances.</p>
<p>We go on in the same very quiet fashion, as when you were in England, &amp; I have no news to tell.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> By the way your old landlord M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Thompson of Keston is dead of creeping paralysis, &amp; poor fellow he is no great loss. His house has now been fitted up for a new person of the name of Huxley, who boasts that he is “no relation to that horrid Professor Huxley”,—so he won’t be much of a neighbour to us.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Our quiet, however, was broken a couple of days ago by Gladstone calling here.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I never saw him before &amp; was much pleased with him: I expected a stern, overwhelming sort of man, but found him as soft &amp; smooth as butter, &amp; very pleasant. He asked me whether I thought that the United States would hereafter play a much greater part in the history of the world than Europe. I said that I thought it would, but why he asked me, I cannot conceive &amp; I said that he ought to be able to form a far better opinion,—but what that was he did not at all let out.</p>
                    <p>Once again accept my thanks | &amp; with all good wishes | believe me, Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>

Norton concluded: ‘their respective methods of investigation and of statement are of such excellence, and their desire for truth so sincere and impersonal, that their works would remain as models of scientific investigation and philosophic inquiry even though they should lose their doctrinal authority.’</note>
