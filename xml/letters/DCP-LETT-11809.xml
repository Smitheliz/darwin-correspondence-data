                    <p>Your letter surprised me almost as much as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich’s first one; &amp; part of it gave us all a real good laugh.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I thank you most heartily for writing &amp; so kindly, for we were dying with curiosity to know what sort of man M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich was. We inferred rightly from the very nice &amp; delicate letters which he wrote, that he was a thorough gentleman, &amp; that was all which we could make out.— It seems a great shame that he should leave his fortune to me, who am well provided; but I told him in my first letter that I was what might be called a rich man, &amp; that the knowledge of this might alter his intention, but it has not done so: I told him, however, that I had 5 sons &amp; that two of them were too great invalids ever to gain any income, so that I was very glad of an addition to my fortune.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have offered to go to an inn at Worthing in the spring with my wife, &amp; thus see him, for he told me in answer to an invitation that he could not come here.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Altogether it is an extraordinary affair, but as he consulted so good &amp; true a friend as you have ever been to me, it does seem quite so strange as it appeared at first.— It has pleased me greatly in many ways &amp; especially on my childrens account, for it is improbable that I myself should ever receive his property.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
