<p>When you read this you will understand why I have not answered your letter earlier.— I returned from a geological trip with Prof: Sedgwick in N Wales on Monday 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of August.— I found your letter there, &amp; with a joint one from Henslow &amp; Peacock of Trinity, offering me the place of Naturalist in a vessel fitted for going round the world.— This I at first, (owing to my Father not liking it I refused) but my Uncle, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wedgwood, took every thing in such a different point of view, that we returned to Shrewsbury on 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of September, &amp; convinced my Father.— On 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> started for Cam: then again from a discouraging letter from my captain I again gave it up. But yesterday every thing was smoother.—&amp; I think it most probable I shall go: but it is not certain, so do not mention it to any body.— I have had a most tremendous hard week of it.— Cap Fitzroy seems every thing I could wish: the most serious objections are the time (3 years), &amp; the smallness of the vessel. Fitzroy is determined to get over the latter for me.— Our route is Madeira, Canary, Rio de Janeiro, 18 month in S America chiefly S. extremity, we shall see every principle city in it.—then through South sea islands, Australia, India, Home.— Of course nothing is quite certain. we sail on 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> October.— of course I will write to you again.—</p>
<p>Your letter gave me great pleasure.— You cannot imagine how much your former letter annoyed &amp; hurt me.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But thank heaven, I firmly believe that it was <hi rend="underline">my own</hi> <hi rend="underline">entire</hi> fault in so interpreting your letter.— I lost a friend the other day, &amp; I doubt whether the moral death, (as I then wickedly supposed) of our friendship did not grieve me as much as the real &amp; sudden death of poor Ramsay.— We have known each other too long to need I trust any more explanations.— But I will mention just one thing; that on my death bed, I think I could say I never uttered one insincere (which at the time I did not fully feel) expression about my regard for you— One thing more.— The sending <hi rend="underline">immediately</hi> the insects on my honor was an unfortunate coincidence, I forgot how you naturally would take them.— When you look at them now, I hope no unkindly feelings will rise in your mind.—&amp; that you will believe that you have always had in me a sincere &amp; I will add, an obliged friend. The very many pleasant minutes that we spent together in Cambridge rose like departed spirits in judgement against me: May we have many more such, will be one of my last wishes in leaving England.—</p>
<p>God bless you dear old Fox May you always be happy.— | Yours truly | Chas Darwin</p>
<p>I have left your letter behind so do not know whether I direct right</p>
