                    <p>I have found the article— at least I believe so. The book I looked at in London was something different from the one in our Library &amp; I think must have been the Monthly Review whilst this is the Monthly Magazine. It is a biographical sketch of E.D.. I have not read it but am having it copied. I saw something about a £100 promissory note given by Col. Pole to his wife, which I guess is the calumny.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I daresay I shall have the copy tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Jackson has given me a copy of Eras. D.’s book about female education. Do you see the advertisement of the Miss Parker’s at the end— was it written as a puff of their school—&amp; is’nt there some story of their being his natural daughters. I think old M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Greaves of Cheltenham told us something about it.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Her letters to me are in the tin pedigree box in my bedroom, perhaps you might look at them.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Bradshaw says he knows nothing of any letters of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Okes’ in the University Library &amp; so we shall not find them—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The Provost of King’s was one of 23 children &amp; so the letters may be in possession of the other 22 or their descendants—for the old fellow is over 80.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Has a book come for me at Down, for I have received a post card forwarded from Down saying that a presentation copy of Thomson &amp; Taits Nat. Philos. has been sent me.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I shd. like to have it forwarded if it has come &amp; <hi rend="underline">to know at once if it has not</hi>.</p>
<p>I am very much pleased that Thomson sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have thought me worthy of a copy.</p>
                    <p>I believe I have made a little astronomical discovery as to a correction which ought to be applied on taking observations of the Sun— I had never seen it in text books but I cdn’t conceive that it was new, until I found two astronomers here who had never heard of it. One of them a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Knobel is going to ask a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Marth who was the great Bessel’s assistant if it is known &amp; to let me know.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> It would be very funny if I have really hit on anything new in such a very old subject—&amp; moreover it is founded on such very simple considerations   I can’t however think it is new as yet.</p>
<p>If it is so, however I shall sent a note to a German Astron. Journal to try to stir up the German Astron<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. to examine the Solar observations to search for the theoretical inequality in the Sun’s motion</p>
<p>I have begun doing arithmetic in my work &amp; my first attempt (which is always wrong however) makes it look as though the results would fit to a T into what I thought might be the case &amp; if they do I think my theory w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be almost established.</p>
