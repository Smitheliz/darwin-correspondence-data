<p>I have been greatly interested by your article in the Quarterly.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It seems to me the best analysis of the mind of an animal which I have ever read, &amp; I agree with you on most points. I have been particularly glad to read what you say about the reasoning power of dogs &amp; about that rather vague matter, their self-consciousness.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I dare say however that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> prefer criticisms to admiration. I regret that you quote Jesse so often: I made enquiries about one case (which quite broke down) from a man who certainly ought to have known Mr Jesse well, &amp; I was cautioned that he had not written in a scientific spirit.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I regret also that you quote old writers;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> it may be very illiberal but their statements go for nothing with me, &amp; I suspect with many others. It passes my powers of belief that dogs ever commit suicide; assuming the statements to be true, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> think it more probable that they were distraught &amp; did not know what they were doing; nor am I able to credit about fetishes.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>One of the most interesting subjects in yr article seems to me to be about the moral sense.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Since publishing the Descent of Man I have got to believe rather more than I did in dog’s having what may be called a conscience. When an honourable dog has committed an undiscovered offence he certainly seems ashamed (&amp; this is the term naturally &amp; often used) rather than afraid to meet his master.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> My dog, the beloved &amp; beautiful Polly, is at such times extremely affectionate towards me; &amp; this leads me to mention a little anecdote. When I was a very little boy, I had committed some offence, so that my conscience troubled me; &amp; when I met my father,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I lavished so much affection on him, that he at once asked me what I had done, &amp; told me to confess. I was so utterly confounded at his suspecting any thing, that I remember the scene clearly to the present day; &amp; it seems to me that Polly’s frame of mind on such occasions is much the same as was mine, for I was not then at all afraid of my father.</p>
<p>This note is not worth sending, but I have nothing better to write &amp; I remain with kind regards to Miss Lloyd<ref target="#foot.f9"/> | yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
