<p>I have returned from Norway after four delightful months but without being able to solve the problem of the horns of the ♀ Rendeer.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> All that one man—a hunter who <hi rend="underline">lived</hi> among them—could say was that he <hi rend="underline">never</hi> saw the hinds when dropping their calves, but that on their reappearance after a month’s absence or concealment the horns are renewed—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have however offered a reward which will probably clear up the matter next spring.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>We had a most unusual migration of Lemmings this year— They must have come in the winter as there were none in Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. last year, &amp; in the spring of this year they swarmed— I cannot comprehend their aimless habit of swimming out on the lakes—unless it should be to clean themselves of fleas—with which they were all infested— or is it merely the migratory impulse— there were at least 4 broods this summer, &amp; it seems incomprehensible that this army should ever vanish (as it doubtless will) next year. Nearly all the older specimens were denuded of hair on the rump &amp; sore, but I could not find out the cause, but strongly suspect it arose from their unreasonable ferocity— the approach of even a fancied enemy makes them yell &amp; dance with rage, while keeping the back against some favoring stone, &amp; as their <hi rend="underline">real</hi> enemies are legion I fancy the abrasion is caused by their perpetually putting their “backs up”— They are however most unpalateable, to me &amp; my dogs— the foxes don’t seem to eat many of those they kill but it is confidently believed that Rendeer &amp; even Cows eat them.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I hear from my Brother at Philadelphia—en route for everywhere—he is collecting most vigorously &amp; I should much like to join him—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have, however, taken a house here for 7 years &amp; cannot well be away the whole year—</p>
<p>I am sorry to have failed this time when I thought myself secure of the information but still hope—&amp; am | ever yours sincerely | W D Crotch</p>
