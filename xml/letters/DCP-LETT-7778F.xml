<p>I write to thank you for your letter, and for informing me that the New York Liberal Club has done me the honor of electing me a member.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>You ask me to give some advice to beginners in the study of biology; but this is at all times very difficult, and scarcely possible without knowing the taste, knowledge and opportunities of the individual. I have often been asked and have generally recommended each man to follow the bent of his inclination, and investigate any point which may chance to excite his curiosity. Unless a man’s curiosity is well roused, and he has an ardent desire to understand the cause of some fact, he will hardly undertake the labor of accurate and careful investigation. Without speculation few good, or at least original discoveries have, as I believe, ever been made. Formerly, many geologists used to reprobate all speculation, but in fact they were working on other men’s speculations instead of their own; otherwise, they might as well have counted or measured all the pebbles in a gravel pit as have observed other and more important points. He who speculates much ought, however, to learn, and must learn to a certain extent, if his work is to be worth anything, to give up repeatedly and manfully his most cherished views, if facts run counter, as they generally do, against every first-formed theory. From the importance, as I hold it, of speculation for discovery, or even for good observations, I have always considered Lyell’s “Principles of Geology” as the best book for a beginner in all the branches of natural science.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>These remarks are not worth sending across the Atlantic, but I have nothing better to offer, and my time is much occupied.</p>
<p>I remain, dear Sir, yours very faithfully, | Ch. Darwin.</p>
