<p>I have received your letter this morning for further information regarding the discovery of the seed.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> From the first I was aware of the necessity of ascertaining if there was no deception in the case, and the following is a true statement regarding it.</p>
<p>There were only two person present when it was discovered, viz, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. John Bell “the actual owner of the sand-pit,” and Thomas Welsh, a Galashiels carter. Much sand was being driven from the pit at that time, which was dug from a breast about 10 or 12 feet high, Welsh was driving sand to Galashiels for a Plasterer, and as it required to be the finest which was best at bottom, he was digging it out from the unbroken beds, and rather undermining the bank when he discovered the seed, upon observing it he said to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bell (who was standing near by) what is that amongst the sand? They both examined it, and saw it was seed of a kind they knew nothing off, Welsh had it upon his shovel and was going to throw it upon the Cart, When it occurred to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bell that possibly I would be curious to see it: accordingly he carefully collected it, and sent it direct by Welsh to me. I questioned him very minutely about it, and went directly to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bell who told me the same tale exactly in every circumstance, they are both middle aged men. Welsh is rather the oldest being upwards of 50. They are both men of strict integrety, who would by no means be parties in countenancing any trick in the matter, In place of expecting any reward, they did not think the discovery of any interest whatever, The second time I questioned Welsh about it he rather became indignant, and replied, “What! do you think I would tell a lee about that, its just as true as I am a living <hi rend="underline">Sinner,</hi> and have <hi rend="underline">death</hi> to meet with.— I have enclosed certificates respecting those men, and could obtain 100 as good— Mr Pringle has known Bell from Infancy. And M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Haldane our Brewer and Elder can place every confidance in Welshs testimony.— I visited the Pit immediately after the discovery with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bell, but nothing more was to be got.— Independent of the above, the seed had every appearance of being very old, had it been Whea〈t〉 or any common seed there would have been mor〈e〉 reason to doubte it truth, but where was seed of that kind to be found in the spring?.—</p>
