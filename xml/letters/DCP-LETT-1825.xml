                <div type="transcription">
<p>Last night I was roused about midnight by the arrival of my home letters,—a sufficiently formidable array of correspondence, which it is utterly impossible that I can do justice to by the present out-going mail. I am pleased to find that Owen does not oppose my views regarding the “great Orang-utan question”.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have a long letter from you undated, but mentioning in a <hi rend="underline">P.S.</hi> that you had just rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. mine of Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. &amp; <hi rend="underline">22</hi> <hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>. <ref target="#foot.f2"/> Since my last, I have had no time for penning notes; but must call your attention to an article in the ‘Echo du monde savant,’ No 98, Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. 24/36, which I only know of by the reference to it in <hi rend="underline">Rev. Zool. de la Soc. Cuv.</hi> 1841, p. 33.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The said article describes “une belle et rare variété du <hi rend="underline">Cyprinus carpio</hi>, L., dont la couleur était d’un beau <hi rend="underline">rouge aurore</hi>”. This at once led me to suspect that <hi rend="underline">C. auratus</hi> is just such a variety of an affined species, which John Chinaman had carefully bred from in the first instance, though now become so common!<ref target="#foot.f4"/> If so, there should be a grey wild Chinese Carp, of which the ‘Gold &amp; Silver Fish’ our cultivated varieties,—the curious triple-tailed <hi rend="underline">C. macropthalmos</hi>, however, being probably an abnormal variety of another species indigenous to China. As these are the only very marked <hi rend="underline">cultivated varieties</hi> in the class of <hi rend="underline">Pisces</hi>, the subject merits investigation. Since I last wrote, I have been following up my enquiries respecting gallinaceous birds in general, and have embodied a great deal of curious matter in an article for the ‘Calcutta Sporting Review’, which you will see in due course;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; you will learn from it that you at present much underrate our actual knowledge of the wild gallinaceous birds all the world over; and at once comprehend the grounds for my <hi rend="underline">very decided opinion</hi>, that we may seek in vain for wild types of <hi rend="underline">G. giganteus</hi>, &amp;c. I don’t wish to seem dictatorial; but feel that my knowledge is now about as complete as it well can be, regarding the wild types of <hi rend="underline">Gallus</hi>. Should however one still remain unknown to me, which I think most unlikely, undoubtedly Cochin China, Cambogia, &amp; Siam, are the countries of S Asia least known to zoologists; but then for ages past they have been more or less connected with China, &amp; the wealthy Chinese are fond of keeping pheasants, &amp;c &amp;c, &amp; pay such high prices for rarities that our first knowledge of various Malayan species was derived from the inmates of Chinese aviaries. I have some skins of Jungle-fowl for you, illustrative of the variation observable among them; &amp; the tarsus I find varies remarkably in length, as you will see. <ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>By the way, do you know the positively wild <hi rend="underline">Numida meleagris</hi> from <hi rend="underline">Guinea</hi>, as distinguished from Ogilby’s <hi rend="underline">N. Rendallii</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> said to be the ordinary species of the Gambia? Another species which I should like to know about, is the <hi rend="underline">N. coronata</hi> (in addition to <hi rend="underline">N. mitrata</hi>, if not also <hi rend="underline">N. cristata</hi>) in S. Africa. Have you seen Albin’s figure of the lost breed of crested Turkeys?<ref target="#foot.f8"/> There seems no doubt about them; but Dixon’s supposed “wild Crested Turkeys” of Central America are clearly <hi rend="underline">Cracidæ</hi>, from the notice cited of the nest &amp; (two) eggs of one of them.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> A true Turkey would lay more eggs than could be accommodated in a <hi rend="underline">tree-nest</hi>; &amp; all the <hi rend="underline">Pavonidæ</hi> without exception nestle on the ground. By <hi rend="underline">Pavonidæ</hi> I mean the united <hi rend="underline">Phasianidæ</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Tetraonidæ</hi>, Auct., which are <hi rend="underline">empyrical</hi> &amp; artificial divisions, the <hi rend="underline">very types</hi> of which (<hi rend="underline">Ph. colchicus</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">T. tetrix</hi>) are so nearly affined as not unfrequently to interbreed <hi rend="underline">in the wild state</hi>!</p>
<p>Upon sound anatomical distinctions, I divide the gallinaceous birds into 5 essentially distinct families, which do not intergrade,—viz. <hi rend="underline">Cracidæ</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Megapodiidæ</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Syrrhaptidæ</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Pavonidæ</hi>, and <hi rend="underline">Tinamidæ</hi> (including <hi rend="underline">Turnix</hi>). Thus arranged, we can generalize a good deal to some purpose. It is not unlikely that any treatise on the Gallinaceæ in the ‘Calcutta Sp. Rev.’ may grow in time as Prichard’s original Essay on the Human races expanded into a big work,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> but in the meantime, I trust that its present form will elicit the information necessary for completion.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> You mention the Turkey’s tuft as a curious ‘abnormity’ (as it were); especially, I may add, as the Ocellated Turkey does not possess it. Bear in mind, however, that this tuft consists not of bristles, but <hi rend="underline">bristle-like plumes</hi>, which are annually moulted &amp; developed like other true feathers; as are also the <hi rend="underline">eyelashes</hi> of various birds, &amp;c &amp;c.— See Leadbeater’s fine specimen of this rare bird,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; notice (what has never been described) the curious structure of the appendage over the bill, &amp; all the little warts &amp; caruncles. I was not aware of what you mention concerning the <hi rend="underline">muscular foundation</hi> of the tuft in the Polish (<hi rend="underline">Polled</hi>?) fowls. I have been trying to hunt up a notice I remember reading some time ago, in some French work, respecting the wild range of the Golden Pheasant extending I think to Orenbourg; a very remarkable fact, which may account for the ancients having some knowledge of it, however vague, which Cuvier connects with the old descriptions of the <hi rend="underline">Phœnix</hi>!!<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Yesterday I had the great pleasure of seeing a particularly fine living specimen of the exceedingly interesting (to me) animal, <hi rend="underline">Canis primævus</hi> of Hodgson;<ref target="#foot.f14"/> which I suppose you will make acquaintance with by &amp; bye, in the London Zool<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>. Gns. It was much more Fox-like than I expected, but hunts in packs as you know; a most particularly agile, graceful &amp; <hi rend="underline">game</hi> animal, &amp; the original <hi rend="underline">Canis</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">aureus</hi> no doubt. This animal has an immense range, from the Altai, Tibet, &amp;c, over all altitudes of the Himalaya, to central India, the Nilgiris, &amp;c, also in Burma, Malacca, Sumatra &amp; Java; for I strongly lean to the opinion that the <hi rend="underline">C. javanensis</hi>, <hi rend="underline">sumatrensis</hi>, <hi rend="underline">dukhanensis</hi>, <hi rend="underline">primævus</hi>, &amp;c of authors refer all to the same animal, the best name for which is <hi rend="underline">rutilus</hi> of Temminck, since <hi rend="underline">aureus</hi> has been transferred to the Jackal. For many years past I wished much to see this species alive, &amp; now that I have done so, I begin to feel that I understand it.— As you receive specimens from Madeira, kindly procure me some skins of the wild Canary; also ascertain which is the ‘Red-legged Partridge’ of Madeira &amp; also of the Canary isles,—<hi rend="underline">P. petrosa</hi> I suppose. According to Widdrington, this is not found in Spain,<ref target="#foot.f15"/> but is the only species in Sardinia, as in Barbary. I have no specimen of it. I should like also to see the peculiar Chaffinch of Madeira.</p>
<p>About the Seychelles, I know of no conspectus of the terrene fauna of those islands, but am aware that peculiar species exist, especially of land-shells, &amp; also a peculiar Chamæleon. The <hi rend="underline">Helix monodon</hi> is a fine and remarkable species, found always on the <hi rend="underline">Cocos de Mer</hi> which is indigenous only to two or three of the islets, &amp; does not thrive on the others! Consult the well known conchologist, M. Liénard of the Mauritius, respecting the zoology of the Seychelles;<ref target="#foot.f16"/> &amp; if you can get at the publications of the Nat. Hist. Society of the Mauritius, which was an active body during the secretaryship of Julien Desjardins, you are likely to find what you want.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> Did I tell you, that since writing my article on wild Asses,<ref target="#foot.f18"/> I have come to the conclusion that if the real <hi rend="underline">asinus</hi> still exists anywhere in the wild state, it will be in the southern districts of Arabia!<ref target="#foot.f19"/> I find that the Hindu prejudice against domestic fowls is not very ancient, &amp; that fowls were reared in great numbers by the ancient Hindus.<ref target="#foot.f20"/> Consult Horace Hayman Wilson at the India-house.—<ref target="#foot.f21"/> See a notice of a curious breed of Indian cattle at Dacca, in Capt. R. Tytler’s paper on the zoology of Dacca, published a year or two back in the <hi rend="underline">Ann. Mag. N.H.</hi>—<ref target="#foot.f22"/> I now refer to your letter, <hi rend="underline">seriatim</hi>, having thus far cited it from memory. ‘Rock Pigeons’. Remember that the <hi rend="underline">Pterocles</hi> genus is here so called by sportsmen &amp; others; whence the term may be misunderstood by correspondents in this country. You must have misunderstood me about numerous <hi rend="underline">races</hi> of fowls in Negroland, at least I think I must have said that fowls were reared numerously by the Negros of Africa.

I quote from the Encyclopædia Britt<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>., &amp; cannot get at the date of Barbot’s work; but it is curious, from the notice of the Turkey so early in Africa.<ref target="#foot.f24"/> Let me know the date, if you can do so without overmuch trouble. “Domestic fowls with double spur”.<ref target="#foot.f25"/> According to my observation, when birds that typically bear a single spur have also a second, the latter grows from the base of the other underneath. In all the genera of typically double-spurred <hi rend="underline">Pavonidæ</hi>, the spurs are curiously irregular; but whenever a third occurs, it is situate, in like manner, at the base underneath of one of the normal spurs  [DIAGRAM HERE] We have a common Jungle-hen, well spurred.—</p>
