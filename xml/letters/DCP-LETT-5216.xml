<p>I have just rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> your letter of Aug. 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> &amp; am as usual astonished at the number of interesting points which you observe. It is quite curious how by coincidence you have been observing the same subjects that have lately interested me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Your case of the Notylia is quite new to me; but it seems analogous with that of Acropera, about the sexes of which I blundered greatly in my book.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have got an Acropera now in flower &amp; have no doubt that some insect with a tuft of hairs on its tail removes by the tuft the pollinia, &amp; inserts the little viscid cap &amp; the long pedicel into the narrow stigmatic cavity, &amp; leaves it there with the pollen-masses in close contact with, but not inserted into, the stigmatic cavity. I find I can thus fertilize the flowers; &amp; so I can with Stanhopea, &amp; I suspect that this is the case with your Notylia.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> But I have lately had an orchid in flower, viz. Acineta, which I could not any how fertilize.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hildebrand lately wrote a paper shewing that with some orchids the ovules are not mature &amp; are not fertilized until months after the pollen-tubes have penetrated the column; &amp; you have independently observed the same fact, which I never suspected in the case of Acropera.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The column of such orchids must act almost like the Spermatheca of insects. Your Orchis with 2 leaf-like stigmas is new to me; but I feel guilty at your wasting your valuable time in making such beautiful drawings for my amusement.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Your observations on those plants being sterile which grow separately or flower earlier than others are very interesting to me. They w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be worth experimenting on with other individuals: I shall give in my next book several cases of <hi rend="underline">individual</hi> plants being sterile with their own pollen. I have actually got on my list Escholtzia for fertilizing with its own pollen, though I did not suspect it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> prove sterile, &amp; I will try next summer.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> My object is to compare the rate of growth of plants raised from seed fertilized by pollen from the same flower &amp; by pollen from a distinct plant &amp; I think from what I have seen I shall arrive at interesting results.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hildebrand has lately described a curious case of Corydalis cava, which is quite sterile with its own pollen, but fertile with pollen of <hi rend="underline">any</hi> other individual plant of the species.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> What I meant in my paper on Linum about plants being dimorphic in function alone was that they sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be divided into two equal bodies functionally but not structurally different.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I have been much interested by what you say on seeds which adhere to the valves being rendered conspicuous: you will see in the new Edit. of the origin why I have alluded to the <hi rend="underline">beauty</hi> &amp; bright colours of fruit;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> after writing this, it troubled me that I remembered to have seen brilliantly coloured seed, &amp; your view occurred to me. There is a species of Peony in which the inside of the pod is crimson &amp; the seeds dark purple. I had asked a friend to send me some of these seeds, to see if they were covered with any thing which c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> prove attractive to birds.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> some seeds the day after receiving your letter; &amp; I must own that the fleshy covering is so thin that I can hardly believe it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> lead birds to devour them; &amp; so it was in an analogous case with Passiflora gracilis.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> How is this in the cases mentioned by you? The whole case seems to me rather a striking one.</p>
<p>I wish I had heard of Mikania being a leaf-climber before your paper was printed; for we thus get a good gradation from M. scandens to Mutisia with its little modified leaf-like tendrils.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I am glad to hear that you can confirm (but render still more wonderful) Haeckel’s most interesting case of Liriope: Huxley told me that he thought that the case w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> somehow be explained away.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>As for Agassiz &amp; his glaciers in the valley of the Amazons, it seems to me sheer madness, as it does likewise to Lyell; the evidence being wholly insufficient.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> Prof. Asa Gray tells me that A. started with the determination to prove that the whole world had been covered with ice in order to annihilate all Darwinian views.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>I hope I have not troubled you with this long letter &amp; believe me yours very sincerely</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In his letter of 2 August 1866, Müller had discussed dimorphism in Brazilian species of <hi rend="italic">Oxalis</hi>, self-sterility in various plants, and brightly coloured seeds.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, pp. 203–10, CD described <hi rend="italic">Acropera</hi> (now placed in synonymy with <hi rend="italic">Gongora</hi>) as dioecious, concluding that the specimens he examined were male; however, in 1862 John Scott succeeded in pollinating flowers with pollen from the same plant. CD himself eventually pollinated <hi rend="italic">Acropera</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4332.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 7 November [1863]</ref> and n. 6, and the experimental note in DAR 70: 114). In August 1866, CD began experimenting with <hi rend="italic">Acropera</hi> once more, and had recently been successful in pollinating a specimen (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5200.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 30 August [1866]</ref> and n. 11). Müller had reported that he initially supposed that a specimen of <hi rend="italic">Notylia</hi> was male because he could not get pollinia to adhere to the stigma and the ovules seemed rudimentary, but that he later found seed capsules (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5173.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Fritz Müller, 2 August 1866</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Müller later confirmed CD’s description in experiments with <hi rend="italic">Cirrhaea</hi>, a genus related to <hi rend="italic">Acropera.</hi> He described the process by which the pollinium was gradually sucked into the stylar canal after one end was inserted into the narrow entrance of the stigmatic chamber (F. Müller 1868b, pp. 630–1). CD referred to Müller’s description in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Fertilization of orchids’</ref>, p. 153 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 150), and in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6011.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 206. CD’s annotated copy of F. Müller 1868b is in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL. For CD’s finding on <hi rend="italic">Stanhopea</hi>, see his notes, dated 11 to 20 August 1866, in DAR 70: 122–8, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6011.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 171; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 12.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In a note written on 3 July 1866 (DAR 70: 117), CD described his inability to pollinate <hi rend="italic">Acineta</hi>, another orchid genus related to <hi rend="italic">Acropera</hi>, noting that the stigmatic opening was so small that pollen could hardly enter and would not stick. He concluded that he could not conceive how the flower was fertilised. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Fertilization of orchids’</ref>, p. 153, CD mentioned <hi rend="italic">Acineta</hi> as one of the genera of orchids with a narrow entrance to the stigmatic chamber for which the means of pollination was not yet known, but added that insect agency of some kind was certain. For more on the pollination mechanisms of <hi rend="italic">Acineta</hi> and the other orchid genera discussed in nn. 3 and 4, above, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2145.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dressler 1981</ref>, pp. 102–3, 258–9.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2283.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Friedrich Hildebrand</ref> reported his results from pollinating and cross-pollinating several species of orchids in Hildebrand 1863 and 1865c. CD’s annotated copies of both papers are in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL. Hildebrand concluded that pollen caused the ovary to swell and the ovule to develop, after which fertilisation could occur (Hildebrand 1865c, p. 249). CD cited Hildebrand’s articles in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Fertilization of orchids’</ref>, p. 153, and in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6011.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 172. After observing specimens of <hi rend="italic">Notylia</hi> as well as other orchids, Müller had suggested that the ovules of some orchids, especially among the tribe Epidendreae, did not develop until the flower had been opened for some time (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5173.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Fritz Müller, 2 August 1866</ref>).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f16">Müller’s remarks on <hi rend="italic">Liriope</hi> were in a now missing section of his letter of 2 August 1866; however, in a <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Ernst Haeckel of 3 June 1866</ref> (Möller ed. 1915–21, 2: 84–6), Müller informed Haeckel that he had recently confirmed Haeckel’s findings concerning reproduction in certain Hydromedusae species (Haeckel 1865d; see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 13, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4947.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Ernst Haeckel, 6 December [1865]</ref> and n. 9). Haeckel claimed to have discovered a new form of alternation of generations, having observed the apparent budding of individuals of <hi rend="italic">Cunina rhododactyla</hi> (now <hi rend="italic">Pegantha rubiginosa</hi>) from a parent <hi rend="italic">Geryonia hastata</hi> (now <hi rend="italic">G. proboscidalis</hi>).

Müller further observed that all the offspring were males of <hi rend="italic">C. köllikeri</hi> and speculated whether, as in the case of some dimorphic plants, males of one form fertilised females of the other (see Möller ed. 1915–21, 2: 85). It is now generally accepted that larvae of <hi rend="italic">C. octonaria</hi> develop parasitically in the stomach pouches of other medusae such as <hi rend="italic">Liriope</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4488.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Kramp 1961</ref>, p. 282). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2486.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Henry Huxley</ref> had worked on the anatomy and classification of the Medusae (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3991.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">T. H. Huxley 1849</ref>).</note>
