            <p>Thanks for comments on paper and references to related works. Clarifies points on colour distinction between energy-absorbing (green) and energy-expending (bright-hued) portions of plants and on the influence of flower colour in modifying the insect organism.</p>

                    <date>March 19.</date>
                    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
                    <p>I have to thank you very much for your kind comments upon my paper, and for the pains which you have taken in pointing out its weak points.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am also greatly obliged to you for the numerous references which you give me, especially that to R. Sachsse’s Farbstoffe, which I have not yet heard of.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I shall look up the various works and passages you mention, and alter the paper in the senses you indicate.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Mr. Nicholson’s statement that I had published an article on the analogies of plants and animals, there must be some mistake of name, I think.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have talked over the subject with Mr. Nicholson, and have always felt much interest in it—especially from the point of view of Energy—but I have certainly nothing original to offer on the question, and have never written upon it.</p>
                    <p>There are two points in your letter on which I should like, with due deference, to make a remark. The first is this:— I tried as much as possible to avoid the chemical statement of pigments, because obviously I know no more about the subject than can be gained by looking at plants as they grow: but when I wrote a first rough draft and only discriminated between energy-absorbing structures (green leaves or their equivalents) and energy-expending structures, (bulbs, seeds, flowers, growing shoots &amp;c), classing the first as mainly green, the second as apt to assume bright colours other-than-green,—a chemical friend (the Aldrichian Demonstrator in this University)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> objected that the introduction of so ultimate a principle as Energy was needless;—and I accordingly changed it for the expression “oxidation-products.” I see, now, from what you say, that I should have done better to keep to my original phraseology. Briefly, my fundamental observation is this— Chlorophyll, as a whole, in spite of occasional exceptions, gives a green hue to structures in which it largely exists as an active agent: but wherever any upsetting of its ordinary functions occurs, and in all parts where matters other than active chlorophyll occur, there is a more or less pronounced tendency to other colours. No doubt, as you suggest, green may occur in such parts also: but still, I think there are grounds enough for the rough generalization in spite of this—viz. that energy-expending portions of plants show a tendency to bright hues. The generalization, so expressed, is, I think, independent of special chemical or physiological facts:— I mean, it can be verified by observation alone, without the aid of analytic experiment. The generalization may look unimportant in the world as we see it now: but if we place ourselves in imagination among the green acrogens and conifers, the spores and anemophilous flowers, of a carboniferous forest, does it not begin to have a great deal more value? If we think, not of the developed entomophilous flower, but of the steps <hi rend="underline">by which</hi> it developed, does not the fact that bright colours are apt to occur where energy is being expended, become a key to the whole process of its evolution?<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>The second point—a shorter one—is this. I did not mean to suggest that the colours of fruits or flowers had anything to do with the <hi rend="underline">appearance</hi> of insects, birds, or mammals at different geological periods, but merely with the development of a <hi rend="underline">colour-sense</hi> in these animals.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Even in this limited statement, I should refer chiefly to insects (especially bees and butterflies): for I see certain reason for thinking that all vertebrates alike inherit a certain amount of colour-perception from their common ancestor, or, at any rate, that the fishes share it with the terrestrial vertebrates. (However, as I mean to treat this question fully in my book, a copy of which I hope you will do me the favour to accept, I will not now bore you with it.)<ref target="#foot.f8"/> At the same time, I think we may allow that the colours, scents, shapes, and other peculiarities of developed flowers have had much re-active influence in <hi rend="underline">modifying</hi> the insect organism—as we see obviously in bees, in butterflies, and in many protective devices or bits of mimicry:—and especially in modifying those portions of the nervous system on which tastes and instincts (meaning thereby, organically-regulated habits) depend.</p>
<p>With renewed thanks for your kind criticisms—of which I shall gladly avail myself for my book—and with apologies for again trespassing on your valuable time, I am, | Yours very faithfully, | Grant Allen.</p>
                    <p>P.S. It strikes me that Mr. Nicholson’s mistake may be due to the following cause. A paper appeared in a late number of the Cornhill with a title somewhat such as “Can we separate Plants from Animals?” As I am in the habit of contributing quasi-scientific articles to the Cornhill, Mr. Nicholson may have thought the paper was mine—which is not the case.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
