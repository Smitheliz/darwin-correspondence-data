                        <p>I am very much obliged for your caution.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The case stands thus; I had a plant formerly the early flowers of which never expanded &amp; were of small but not quite uniform size; they produced fine capsules. I thought it was a case of arrested development &amp; did not examine them closely. But when I found on the Ceylon specimens still smaller buds my opinion altered; in these the petals were reduced to excessively minute scales which adhered firmly to the bases of the shorter stamens. Small as these flower-buds were, the anthers had dehisced, &amp; pollen-tubes penetrated the stigmas, which were less papillose than those on the perfect flowers.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> These several facts taken together seem to me to justify me in calling the closed flowers cleistogamic; but I should like to hear what you think. Should you be able to find any cleistogamic flowers on any trimorphic species it would interest me greatly to examine them. Hildebrand states in one of his papers that he found cleistogamic flowers on many sp of Oxalis, but he does not say whether they were trimorphic: I think I will write &amp; ask him.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                        <p>With many thanks, | Yours sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>

Oliver suggested that flowers of <hi rend="italic">Oxalis sensitiva</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Biophytum sensitivum</hi>), which CD had suggested were cleistogamic, were probably arrested or imperfectly developed normal flowers.</note>
                <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD added this information in his discussion of cleistogamy in <hi rend="italic">Oxalis sensitiva</hi> in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, pp. 322–4. In addition to noting the smoother surface of the stigma, he also noted that less pollen was produced in the cleistogamic flowers and speculated that the pollen was more potent, since an abundance of seed was produced.</note>
