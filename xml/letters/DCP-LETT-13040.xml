                <div type="transcription">
                     
                    <p>Owing to all sorts of work I have only just now finished reading your “Nat. Conditions of existence”.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Although a book of small size it contains an astonishing amount of matter; &amp; I have been particularly struck with the originality with which you treat so many subjects, &amp; at your scrupulous accuracy. In far the greater number of points I quite follow you in your conclusions; but I differ on some, &amp; I suppose that no two men in the world would fully agree on so many difficult subjects. I have been interested on so many points, I can hardly say on which most. Perhaps as much on Geograph. Distribution as on any other, especially in relation to M. Wagner.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> (No, no! about parasites interested me even more).<ref target="#foot.f3"/> How strange that Wagner sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have thought that I meant by struggle for existence, struggle for food. It is curious that he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not have thought of the endless adaptations for the dispersal of seeds &amp; the fertilisation of flowers.—</p>
                    <p>Again I was much interested about Branchipus &amp; Artemisia: when I read imperfectly some years ago the original paper, I could not avoid thinking that some special explanation would hereafter be found for so curious a case:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I speculated whether a species very liable to <hi rend="underline">repeated</hi> &amp; great changes of conditions, might not acquire a fluctuating condition, ready to be adapted to either conditions.— With respect to Arctic animals, being white, (p. 116 of your book) it might perhaps be worth your looking at what I say from Pallas &amp; my own observations in the Descent of Man (later Editions) Ch. 8 p 229 &amp; Ch 18 p. 542.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>I quite agree with what I gather to be your judgment, viz that the direct action of the conditions of life on organisms, or the cause of their variability is the most important of all subjects for the future..<ref target="#foot.f6"/> For some few years I have been thinking of commencing a set of experiments on Plants, for they almost invariably vary when cultivated. I fancy that I see my way with the aid of continued self-fertilisation. But I am too old &amp; have not strength enough. Nevertheless the hope occasionally revives.</p>
                    <p>Finally, let me thank you for the very kind manner in which you often refer to my works, &amp; for the even still kinder manner in which you disagree with me.—</p>
<p>With cordial thanks for the pleasure &amp; instruction which I have derived from your book, I remain | My dear Professor Semper | Yours sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
                    <p>My son Francis begs to be very kindly remembered to you.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>

Schmankewitsch’s article on the subject was published in 1877 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11140.xml">Schmankewitsch 1877</ref>); CD’s annotated copy is in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL. CD wrote on the cover of his offprint: ‘On changes in Crustaceans from salt water’, adding, with double underlining, ‘Very good’. From the 1890s, however, Schmankewitsch’s views were heavily criticised (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8019.xml">Vucinich 1988</ref>, pp. 84–5, 158–9, 371).
