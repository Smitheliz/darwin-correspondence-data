                    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
                    <p>Two chimpanzees were imported here about two months since, one recently died, and 30 hours after death a post mortem examination was made by a D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Spitzka, a young surgeon of New York who has devoted much attention to the Brain, and is skilled in making very fine sections of the Brain, and spinal cord.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>I beg to send you the few observations that were made upon the <hi rend="underline">general</hi> appearance of the Brain, and will probably forward some time later more detailed, and result of Microscopical examination—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>Species Troglodytes Niger,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Sex Male Age 2 years P.M. made by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Spitzka assisted by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Taylor.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>Professors. Janeway, Darling, Wood, L. A. Sayre, Little, Alexander Mott, Hammond—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> and D<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Bates Sayre J<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Smith and others.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>The body found emaciated, the Omentum deprived of its fat, the intestines the seat of a Catarrhal enteritis and the mesenteric glands tuberculous, enlarged and cheesy— The lungs revealed several tubercles some of which had given rise to reactive inflamation and the Pia mater of the Brain over the Sylvian fissure contained numerous grey and opaque tubercles of different dimensions— The arachnoid fluid was increased in quantity—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>All the organs strikenly resembled those found in the Human race, when the Brain was removed all present were struck by its great resemblance to the Human Brain, this being especially apparent on looking at the base— The cerebrum was richly convoluted and overlapped the cerebellum to the extent of one third of an inch— Several present observed that they could not have distinguished this brain from that of a Human infant.—</p>
                    <p>There are however several distinctive features which become apparent only on closer observation  Although the cerebrum overlaps the cerebellum, and consists of the same lobes is as rich in convolutions as the brain of a Bechuana,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> and possesses a well developed Island of Reil, yet it also has an operculum of the occipital lobe, which the human being do not—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
                    <p>One of the most important human like features of this brain is the absence of a Trapezium, and the presence of the olivary bodies,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> although rudimentary olivary bodies exists in the lower Mammalia yet it causes no perceptible prominence of the medulla, and such a prominence is first observed in the baboons— But in this chimpanzee it is as full and large as in the human being, a fact in full accordance with the high development of the lateral lobes of the cerebellum, for the olivary body keeps pace in its development throughout the animal kingdom with the development of the cerebellar hemisphere.—</p>
<p>I am afraid you have heard all this before and you have probably witnessed the dissection of Chimpanzees and made your own observations, if it is so you must take the will for the deed.</p>
<p>If there is any merit in the observation I should like to know of it, as D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Spitzka is quite a young man, whom I have met for the first time, and appears to be striking out a field for himself in this line of investigation, I saw some very fine preparations at his house, and beautifully prepared sections of Brain and spinal cord, and I should like to give credit for his work if deserved, as it may help him where encouragement is needed, he placed his notes with me to prepare for publication and I send you a copy, he is still at work, and preparing the brain for future investigation.—</p>
                    <p>I suppose you heard that the “Fossil Man” turned out to be a fraud as I indicated to you.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I remain Dear Sir | Yours Respectfully | John Michels</p>
                    <p>Excuse me for drawing attention to <hi rend="underline">your</hi> commencing my name with <hi rend="underline">N</hi>—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> it should be <hi rend="underline">M</hi>.—.</p>
