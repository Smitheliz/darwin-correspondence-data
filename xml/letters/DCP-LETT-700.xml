<p>Your new ear-trumpet has gone by the ship Sultana; it is enclosed in a box from Messrs. Smith and Elder to their correspondent, Mr. Evans (I suppose, bookseller). I was not able to get it sent sooner. You must accept it as a present from me. I presume you will have to pay a trifle for carriage. I recommend you to take your old one to some skilful tinman, and by the aid of an internal plaister cast I have no doubt he could make them. All that is required is an exact resemblance in form. I should think it would answer for him to make one, &amp; hang it up in his shop with an advertisement. I was glad to get your last letter with so good an account of yourself, and that you had made a will. My health is better since I have lived in the country. I have now three children. I am yet at work with the materials collected during the voyage. My coral-reef little book has been published for a year—the subject on which you copied so much M.S. The Zoology of the voyage of the Beagle is also completed. I have lately heard that the Beagle has arrived safe and sound in the Thames,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> but I have heard no news of any of the officers. Your friends at Shrewsbury often enquire after you. I forget whether I ever you that Mrs. Evans<ref target="#foot.f2"/> is married and that my father has built them a nice little house to live in. Captain Fitz Roy, you will have heard, is gone to New Zealand as Governor. I believe he intended to call at Sydney.</p>
<p>With best wishes for your prosperity, which is sure to follow you if you continue in your old upright prudent course, believe me, yours very faithfully | C. D<hi rend="smallCaps">arwin</hi>.</p>
