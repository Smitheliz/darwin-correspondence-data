<p>I was heartily glad to receive your note &amp; receive some news of you.— I thank you very sincerely for your present:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> it seems to me <hi rend="underline">exactly</hi> what I have long wished to read (&amp; it is a most useful book to have as reference); namely a general account of the weather. Of the more purely scientific aspect of the work, I am utterly incapable of judging, for it is years since I attended in the least degree to the subject. But the weather, as weather always interests me, &amp; I daily draw a line on ruled paper to show movement of Barometer.</p>
<p>I have only read a score or so of pages yet; nor shall I be able to finish it for some time, for I have two borrowed Books in hand, which must be finished first.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Owing, also, to my continued weak health, I am able after my mornings work to do extraordinary little; the least attention to anything quite upsetting me. If I have anything to say, beyond general approbation, which I am sure from what little I have seen, it will have from me, it will be a pleasure to me to write.</p>
<p>You enquire about my family I have now six Boys!! &amp; two girls; &amp; it is the great drawback to my happiness, that they are not very robust; some of them seem to have inherited my detestable constitution.—</p>
<p>I have myself been for the last two years &amp; suppose I shall be two more, very hard, (too hard) at work on my species Book, getting it ready for press. By the way I lately found some of your Observations very useful to me.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> You ask what my Book is about, I fear it is almost de rebus omnibus: my attempt is to look at all facts in Nat. Hist &amp; Geology under the two points of view,—has each species been created independently or have species, like varieties, descended from other species? And the upshot is, that I have become dreadfully heteredox about the immutability of species.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have attended especially to Pigeons &amp; kept all the breeds alive, as the best type of variation under domestication, which I believe throws the greatest light on variation in a state of nature. I am sure I have now given you a long prose about my doings, &amp; most heartily do I wish that my doings were done.—</p>
<p>I hope your own health is pretty good: I sincerely sympathise with you in M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Jenyns being an invalid.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Farewell, dear Jenyns; I often remember the pleasant hours which I have spent with you at Bottisham or rather Swaffham.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Believe me | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
