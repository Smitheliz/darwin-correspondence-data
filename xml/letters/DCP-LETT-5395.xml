<p>I am heartily glad that you have been offered the Presidentship of the B. Assoc. for it is a great honour, &amp; as you have so much work to do I am equally glad that you have declined it.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I feel, however, convinced that you would have succeeded very well; but if I fancy myself in such a position it actually makes my blood run cold. I look back with amazement at the skill &amp; taste with which the D. of Argyll made a multitude of little speeches at Glasglow.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> By the way I have not seen the Duke’s book,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but I formerly thought that some of the articles which appeared in periodicals were very clever, but not very profound. One of these was reviewed in the Saturday Review some years ago; &amp; the fallacy of some main argument was admirably exposed, &amp; I sent the article to you, &amp; you agreed strongly with it.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Now I have forgotten this counter-argument &amp; I know I shall be humbugged by the Duke, if I reread him as I suppose I must. There was the other day a rather good review of the Duke’s book in the Spectator, &amp; with a new explanation, either by the Duke or Reviewer (I could not make out which) of rudimentary organs; viz that economy of labour &amp; material was a great guiding principle with God (ignoring waste of seed &amp; of young, monsters &amp;c &amp;c), &amp; that making a new plan for the structure of animals was thought &amp; thought was labour, &amp; therefore God kept to a uniform plan &amp; left rudiments.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> This is no exaggeration. In short, God is a man rather cleverer than us: I wonder they did not suggest that he would suffer from indigestion, if he worked his brains too much.— I am very much obliged for the “Nation” (returned by this post): it is <hi rend="underline">admirably</hi> good:<ref target="#foot.f6"/> you say I always guess wrong, but I do not believe anyone, except Asa Gray could have done the thing so well. I would bet even, or 3 to 2, that it is Asa Gray, though one or two passages staggered me.</p>
<p>I finish my Book on “Domestic Animals &amp;c” by a single paragraph answering, or rather throwing doubt, in so far as so little space permits on Asa Gray’s doctrine that each variation has been specially ordered or led along a beneficial line. It is foolish to touch such subjects, but there have been so many allusions to what I think about the part which God has played in the formation of organic beings, that I thought it shabby to evade the question.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I have even received several letters on subject. One was a funny one from a lady with a whole string of questions, &amp; when I said I could not answer one; she wrote she was perfectly satisfied &amp; it was exactly what she expected.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I overlooked your sentence about Providence, &amp; suppose I treated it as Buckland did his own theology, when his Bridgewater Treatise was read aloud to him for correction.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I do not quite understand what you mean; partly from Providence meaning either simply God or hourly, providential care.—</p>
<p>That seems a very difficult point to conjecture on, whether an insular genus originated on the island or survived there.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> When several allied species occur in an archipelago the probability seems that it was created there; as it shows it has long there been a varying &amp; is a well adapted form. I forget whether the Umbellifers live on the other Atlantic Islands.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Supposing that the Deer’s bones are <hi rend="underline">not</hi> those of a naturalised animal, (for certainly there was no deer, when Mauritius was discovered) it is a grand case of continental extension &amp; of greatest value. If you see Owen, caution him, but <hi rend="underline">not from me</hi>, about the many animals which have been there naturalised.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I saw in Proof-sheet the passage in a note by Owen about ideal types; he outdoes himself in audacious impudence on this head, &amp; makes it the ground for an attack on Huxley.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Send me a copy of your Insular paper when printed, as several of us want to read it.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>I told Murray not to publish my book blindly, &amp; he has kept the M.S long &amp; is frightened, perhaps with good reason, for I never know when I go too much into detail; &amp; the details are to be printed in smaller type; &amp; at last the M.S is in printer’s hands.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/> In the interval I began a chapter on Man, for which I have long collected materials, but it has grown too long, &amp; I think I shall publish separately a very small volume, “an essay on the origin of mankind:”<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I have convinced myself of the means by which the Races of man have been mainly formed, but I do not expect I shall convince anyone else.—<ref target="#foot.f17"/> I wish the dreadful six-month labour of correcting press was over.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>Hensleigh Wedgwood has been very ill, &amp; is sadly pulled down, but is now recovering.—<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>Give our very kind remembrances to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hooker &amp; our congratulations on her coming down stairs<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>Ever yours affect<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> | C. Darwin</p>
<p>On Feb 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> we go for a week to 6 Queen Anne St.—<ref target="#foot.f21"/> I wish there was any chance of your being in London &amp; seeing you.—</p>

On the other hand, an omnipotent and omniscient Creator ordains everything and foresees everything.
