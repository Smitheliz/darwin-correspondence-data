<p>Your last letter received two days ago contained a multitude of curious facts about orchids.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The case of the little orchid of which the long pedicelli performs such curious movements is very interesting. I once suspected that the pollen when partially dry acted best, but was quite unable to prove it; I daresay the final cause is what you suggest.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Hildebrand of Bonn has just published a book which I have not read but which seems to me very good on the fertilisation of plants. I think it would perhaps interest you so I will get an additional copy &amp; send it.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Many thanks for your answer about the Maxillaria.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The seeds of the Plumbago which you have sent are a treasure to me.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I shall also be curious to see the two lobelias.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The little bulbs of your semi-dioceus oxalis are growing well, except those of the flowers with semi foliaceous stamens &amp; none of these grew; the others will not flower this year. Your Cordias have germinated well, but as I suppose they are trees I fear I never shall see them in flower.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have dispatched two copies of y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. paper on Climbing Plants as directed &amp; will with pleasure send any others.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Your brother (as I now know him to be) sent me some time ago some papers on mosses in which he has worked out with great care the variability of certain forms.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I am working very hard at correcting proofs of my new book &amp; the corrections are very heavy.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I fear that neither you nor anyone will care much about this book which has cost me much more labour, I suspect, than it is worth.</p>
<p>I am extremely glad to hear that you like Häckel’s book;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> it is so long &amp; the german rather difficult that I have been able to read only small portions. He seems to me a singularly clear thinker with great powers of methodical arrangement, but I have not met with much that seems actually new. I have, however, no right to judge. I liked the man so much that I do hope his book will be very successful.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>My dear Sir, believe me | yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. What can be the cause of flowers like y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Echites catching insects?<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
