<p>I am wonderfully taken with Tylor’s book &amp; anxious to know your opinion of it—which seems to me quite exceptionally good.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have an admirable note from Huxley about this Lyellian affair, of the demerits of which he seems have a perfect appreciation. I enclose it.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I have just begun your climbers.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>My wife does not recover fast,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; still complains of a good deal of pain. We hope to get away to Teesdale on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. the Benthams going with us.<ref target="#foot.f6"/>—sleeping at York the first night.</p>

<p>I did not reply to your note last week<ref target="#foot.f7"/> as I was in hopes after all that you might have come upon our ploy, which was very successful always excepting your own and Mrs Hooker’s absence which was a great regret to all of us. I trust our not having you with us is no evidence that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hooker is any worse.</p>
<p>As you say, this Lyello-Lubbockian business is not a pleasing shindy. I have known all about it from the first from Lubbock &amp; have given such advice as I thought would tend most towards a peaceful solution of the difficulty—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Latterly Lyell has been to me &amp; I have found it very difficult to deal honestly with both sides without betraying the confidence of either or making matters worse</p>
<p>The candle is a very small one &amp; by no means worth the game— and I should have absolutely dissuaded Lubbock from taking any notice of the small plunder that had taken place, if it had not been for that unlucky note in which Lyell (innocently I do believe but very stupidly) expressly affirmed he had got nothing from Lubbock:<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; thereby (as it was obvious somebody had copied from somebody)—threw the onus upon Lubbocks shoulders— This rankled in Lubbocks mind &amp; like all quiet and mild men who do get a grievance he became about twice as ‘wud’<ref target="#foot.f10"/> as Berserks like you &amp; me. It was as much as I could do to get him to write to Lyell for an explanation before coming out with a preface to which what you have seen is milk &amp; water.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I hoped that Lyell would see he was in a mess &amp; would set the whole affair straight with half a dozen words of frank explanation as he might have done— Instead of that came a long windy affair looking at the whole business from an exclusively Lyellian point of view and really dictating to Lubbock what he should do to get Lyell out of the scrape— Of course the Lubbockian furnace got seven times hotter and it is a mercy nothing worse came of it than what you saw in Lubbocks preface<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I am very glad you backed up my advice to Lyell.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I must say he has behaved fairly enough since I put my finger into the pie and has done all I asked him to do— Lubbock I hope, will also comply with my (or rather I should say <hi rend="underline">our</hi> Tyndall &amp; Busk<ref target="#foot.f14"/> being his advisers with me) advice to cancel his own note &amp; then all trace of a shindy which one will be glad to forget will have been wiped out.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>I don’t mind fighting to the death in a good big row but when A and B are supplying themselves from C’s orchard I don’t think it is very much worthwhile to dispute whether B filled his pockets directly from the trees or indirectly helped himself to the contents of A’s basket— If B <hi rend="underline">has</hi> so helped himself he certainly ought to say so like a man: but if I were A, I would not much care whether he did or not</p>
<p>Lyell has been horribly disgusted about it— but I am not sure the discipline may not have opened his eyes to new &amp; useful aspects of nature</p>
<p>Give our kindest regards 〈to〉 Mrs Hooker and say how gri〈eved〉 we are to hear of her illness</p>
<p>Ever yours faithfully, | T H Huxley</p>
