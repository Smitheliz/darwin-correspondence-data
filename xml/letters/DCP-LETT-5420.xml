<p>Expression of emotions is another subject he plans to include in his essay [<hi rend="italic">Descent</hi>].</p>

<p>Bates was quite right, you are the man to apply to in a difficulty. I never heard any thing more ingenious than your suggestion &amp; I hope you may be able to prove it true.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> That is a splendid fact about the white moths: it warms one’s very blood to see a theory thus almost proved to be true.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> With respect to the beauty of male butterflies, I must as yet think that it is due to sexual selection; there is some evidence that Dragon-flies are attracted by bright colours; but what leads me to the above belief is, so many male Orthoptera &amp; Cicadas having musical instruments. This being the case the analogy of birds makes me believe in sexual selection with respect to colour in insects.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I wish I had strength &amp; time to make some of the experiments suggested by you;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but I thought butterflies w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not pair in confinement; I am sure I have heard of some such difficulty.</p>
<p>Many years ago I had a dragon-fly painted with gorgeous colours but I never had an opportunity of fairly trying it.</p>
<p>The reason of my being so much interested just at present about sexual selection is that I have almost resolved to publish a little essay on the Origin of Mankind, &amp; I still strongly think (tho’ I failed to convince you, &amp; this to me is the heaviest blow possible) that sexual selection has been the main agent in forming the races of Man.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>By the way there is another subject which I shall introduce in my essay, viz expression of countenance; now do you happen to know by any odd chance a very good-natured &amp; acute observer in the Malay Arch. who you think w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> make a few easy observations for me on the expression of the Malays when excited by various emotions? For in this case I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> send to such person a list of queries.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I thank you for your <hi rend="underline">most interesting</hi> letter &amp; remain | yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>

CD eventually concluded in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 1: 399, 403–4, that bright colours in male butterflies and some male moths were generally a result of sexual selection rather than for protection.
