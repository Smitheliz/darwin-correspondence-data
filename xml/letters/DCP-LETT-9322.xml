<p>I have delayed writing you because I was unwilling to do so until I could give you some definite information.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have been unable to find any experiments upon the digestion of chlorophyll &amp; therefore have tried some myself. For some time I could not obtain any chlorophyll &amp; have just finished my observations. The chlorophyll I used is that obtained during the manufacture of green extracts by the process given in the British Pharmacopœia.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I placed a piece the size of a pea in each of 5 test tubes.</p>

<p>They remained for five days at a temperature of 37<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>C. The liquid acquired a slightly brown colour &amp; the pieces of chlorophyll became swollen &amp; ragged but they did not diminish in size   The chlorophyll in N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. 1 fell to a powder but this was partly due to shaking. A second experiment with the glycerine extract of pancreas has given an entirely negative result. The glycerine extracts are both active. That of the stomach digests fibrine with extreme rapidity &amp; had a piece of blood fibrin been used instead of chlorophyll it would have disappeared in less than ten minutes, instead of being unaltered after five days. Chlorophyll also seems to be little affected by the juices of the alimentary canal in the human subject for as far as my experience goes the chlorophyll of spinach communicates a green colour to the faeces. The same appears to me to be the case in cows, if one may judge from the appearance of the faeces &amp; probably the black colour of the excreta in goats &amp; sheep is also due to chlorophyll at least in part. Chlorophyll as obtained by me (from a friend) is of a very dark green, almost black colour.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>In regard to Chondrin I have succeeded in finding a few references. A. M. Thurn Moleschott’s Untersuchungen V. p 315–318<ref target="#foot.f4"/> finds that dried cartilage (or tendon) is dissolved by dilute hydrochloric acid either alone or with pepsin in 3 days gelatin is dissolved in 2–6 hours. Both are acted on in much the same time &amp; way by dilute acid of .4 per cent when alone as when pepsin is also present (The acid is too strong)   Metzler, working under Heidenhaur’s direction finds that gastric juice with dilute acid dissolves cartilage &amp; deprives the solution of its power to gelatinize.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> This action is due to the pepsin for it is destroyed</p>

I send a copy of the Me〈dic〉al Record containing an abstract of some experiments of Voit on gelatin but I do not know whether it will be of any service or not.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I will keep a look out &amp; if I meet with any experiments on the nutritive value of 〈c〉hondrin I 〈<hi rend="underline">3 lines missing</hi>〉 example less striking 〈    〉 〈re〉marks is the countenance 〈    〉 Holman Hunt’s picture of 〈    〉 of Death now 〈ex〉hibiting 〈    〉 side of the face it seems to me has an expression of weariness alone while the left side expresses little or no w〈ear〉iness but a curious mixture of longing &amp; energy.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The express〈io〉n of the two sides of the face can be <hi rend="underline">voluntarily</hi> rendered quite different by some persons. I can do so to a considerable extent myself, and some tim〈e〉 ago I believe a man gave an en〈tert〉ain〈ment〉 〈    〉 Egyptian Hall<ref target="#foot.f9"/> or some 〈    〉 of amusement by ex〈  〉 〈    〉 in this respect. 〈    〉 Russell, Deputy Surveyor General of Canada<ref target="#foot.f10"/> tells me that some years ago an acquaintance of his used greatly to torment the superior of his department by making odd faces at his comrades while the side of his face which was turned towards the superior maintained the profoundest gravity.</p>
<p>The expression of the two sides of the face is also different under certain <hi rend="underline">pathological</hi> conditions such as hemicrania. This I have 〈    〉 obser〈ved〉 in myself〈    〉 face app〈  〉ed by the 〈    〉 appearance of 〈    〉 〉 other side was perfectly 〈n〉ormal. The recurrence of a different expression on the two sides of the face as an indication of mixed emotions is noticed by Dumas in his Memoirs of a Physician where he describes Rousseau as listening to the performance of one of his pieces by the king &amp; queen. Delighted at the favour done him by these royal personages but disgusted by the miserable execution of his piece he was like a monkey eating<ref target="#foot.f11"/> 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 one side of 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 other. Althoug〈h〉 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 that Dumas is 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 of a popular expression which is to be heard I think in England as well as France, yet the expression seems to indicate that the facts have been observed by somebody &amp; probably by many. Indeed the difference of expressions on the two sides of the face seems to me to appear in sneering. A one-sided sneer is much more irritating than a double one, if I may judge from practice 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 one 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 disgust 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 〈t〉hat expression 〈<hi rend="underline">2 or 3 words</hi>〉 which distinguishes the single sneer.</p>
<p>The portrait of Locke, Fig 60 in Piderit’s Mimik und Physiognomik (1867)<ref target="#foot.f12"/> shows a combination which I have frequently observed in my own face when looking at it in the mirror full in front so that the expression was not due to one side of the face being seen partially &amp; the other completely. The one side the right is contented &amp; placid, the other the left restless anxious &amp; even pained. I am left handed &amp; it is the right side of my face which is restless. I see that 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 as an example 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 with a low f〈  〉 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 know the eye 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 I am inclined to think that the expressions of the two side of the face differ most frequently in persons with small heads &amp; of a nervous temperament. The Christ in Holman Hunt’s picture is a typical example of the temperament I mean. I have no portrait of Byron<ref target="#foot.f13"/> at hand but he also belongs to the class &amp; ought to show a difference of expression unless at perfect rest.</p>
<p>〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 〈s〉ome interest 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 serpent worship 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 struck with your 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 of the horr〈or〉 monkeys <hi rend="italic">[</hi>have of<hi rend="italic">]</hi> snakes. I supp〈ose〉 this horror would become the basis of a religion in any race of monkeys which developed far enough to have one &amp; is probably the origin of the worship which was formerly so extensively diffused among mankind. The tree as the representative of good is easy to understand &amp; the serpent, almost the only enemy the arboreal monkeys need dread, as the type of evil; but the serp<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> as the healer I cannot make out.
