<p>I was very much pleased to receive your letter yesterday. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Colburn has behaved more liberally than I anticipated.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I find three No<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. of the Colonial Library, each of 171 pages, will exactly hold my present vol: &amp; index (without the appendix); now though I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> here &amp; there like to add a sentence, some parts I am sure w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be improved by being shortened, &amp; therefore I want to know how many pages you would prefer the three volumes together to be; &amp; I will try as accurately as I can, to meet your wishes.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I also wish to know (if you would let me hear soon either from yourself, or a clerk) what are your opinions &amp; wishes with respect to woodcuts: I do not much care about them myself, but here &amp; there, I think there is a subject which would be well illustrated by one.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Thirdly, when you would like to publish? &amp; how quickly the numbers follow each other? I have engagements for about 14 days, &amp; then I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, without any halt, complete the whole copy,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; superintend the correcting the press (the quicker the better) whenever you like: I shall be however a rather slow worker in getting ready my few alterations in the first (or already printed) copy.</p>
<p>You will see, I have gone on the assumption of taking advantage of your offer of three numbers: I could not have made up my mind to have wasted so much time, as it would have cost to have shortened my work <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math></formula>; &amp; I firmly believe it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have lessened whatever merit it possesses;—in this opinion I found M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lyell even stronger than myself.—</p>
<p>I shall gladly accept your offer of 100£ for the copyright, to be paid 3 months after date of publication, &amp; shall be happy to sign an agreement to that effect, whenever you like to send one.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I hope not to give you much more trouble &amp; remain dear Sir with thanks, | Your’s very faithfully | C. Darwin</p>
<p>In my calculation I have allowed one of your pages to hold 451 words &amp; mine to hold 377 words.</p>
<p>Would the map appear in the First number?<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
