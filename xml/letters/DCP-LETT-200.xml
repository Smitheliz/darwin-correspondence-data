<p>Catherine who wrote last<ref target="#foot.f1"/> will have told you my very dear Charles how glad we were to have your last letter dated November, and now it is gone to Erasmus— We have also seen a letter M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hughes wrote to the Haycocks &amp; it was speaking so much about you &amp; the great pleasure he had in seeing you, that it was almost as good as hearing from yourself— We shall all treasure this last letter from you, more than any others, as you say we must not expect to hear again for six or nine months, which appears an endless time looking forward.— I congratulate you on your luck in finding those curious remains of the Monster M— I think Geology far the most interesting subject one can imagine &amp; now I have found a very easy way of learning a little smattering of it. The penny Magazines give a few pages (which the most foolish person can understand) in every Number on the subject.— I think this clever penny work has come out since you left England we all <hi rend="underline">swear</hi> by it as it contains every kind of knowledge written so pleasantly with prints.</p>
<p>The race of Wedgwoods is fast encreasing &amp; I must give you the Annual Register.—</p>
<p>Frank’s son &amp; heir Master Godfrey was born on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. of January, &amp; the Hensleighs have got a little Daughter<ref target="#foot.f2"/> born the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. of Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi>.— Uncle Jos has been attending Parliament now nearly a Month. We have not heard much about him except that he finds it fatiguing— His family go up to town after Easter when they will divide themselves between Charlotte &amp; Hensleigh so will take no house in London.— The Radicals are getting so fierce &amp; licentious in the Debates, that Papa gets more &amp; more of a Tory every day.— This Government appears to be perfect for they let no abuses remain. Church Reform &amp; Slavery will certainly be done this Session I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> In short by the time you come back from your surveying expedition so many changes will have taken place that I can’t imagine how you will ever learn them all for Newspapers 9 months old it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be impossible to read.—</p>
<p>I have been staying a great deal at Woodhouse lately to comfort poor Caroline who has <hi rend="underline">no</hi> Sister now Emma being gone to stay with Sarah in London &amp; Fanny &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Biddulph have taken a small <hi rend="underline">nutshell</hi> for 5 months whilst Parliament sits.— Francis is still at home they want to get him into a foot Regiment but find great difficulty. he seems to go on very well with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen which is fortunate. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Owen sometimes talks of packing him off to Canada but this is only a joke I suppose. They have heard f<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Arthur since he reached Madras. he wrote in great spirits &amp; had gone through his first examination so well that they had augmented his salary.— They always talk and enquire much about you at Woodhouse &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Owen still keeps her opinion of Charles Darwin being the happiest person she knows.— Caroline Owen laughed much at recollecting your walks in the wood with Sarah: &amp; a〈fter〉 abusing us all for being such a <hi rend="underline">reserved</hi> family, sa〈id〉 at least “<hi rend="underline">you</hi> were an <hi rend="underline">exception</hi> for she believed there was no family secret you would not tell to Sarah in the wood”.— I am afraid this is all too true Master Charley.— I used to be surprised how you should like making such long visits at the <hi rend="underline">Forest</hi>, but now I stay a fortnight at a time I find it much pleasanter, one becomes so completely one of the family.— It seems so odd to see them reduced to a party of <hi rend="underline">four</hi> at Dinner. Sarah sent for yr direction the other day so I daresay you will find a letter on yr return.—</p>
<p>Charlotte Holland is married to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this Month &amp; Emma Wedgwood goes to the wedding.—</p>
<p>March 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.</p>
<p>Captain Beaufort has very kindly written to tell us that if we send off this letter immediately to him it will catch the Buenos Ayres Mail &amp; will most probably be the last news you will have for sometime I don’t quite understand how this can be—but as you will like to hear as lately as possible that we are all well I pack this off tho’ it is a mighty dull epistle</p>
<p>Dear old Charley I am afraid we shan’t see yr hand writing till September but at least we have the comfort of knowing that your long silence means no harm &amp; is unavoidable.— Catherine &amp; I are just come in from a long walk with the (future M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Hope) alias Louisa Leighton<ref target="#foot.f4"/> they talk of going abroad after their marriage which will suit the Gentleman much better than the Lady I guess.—</p>
<p>Papa desires his most affectionate love to you    We all often talk about you &amp; you are forgotten by nobody I assure you &amp; I have nothing more to give but my best love &amp; blessing | Dear old fellow y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> affectionate <hi rend="underline">Granny</hi> D.</p>
