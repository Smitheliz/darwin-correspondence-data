        <abstract>
            <p>If decapod does not pass through zoea stage, is this acceleration? If hypothetical adult retained zoea characters, would this be retardation? Believes obliteration of growth stages frequently due to natural selection. Most interesting points in AH’s letter deal with senile characters. CD attributes them to laws of growth not selection. Explains degraded characters as result of readaptation to simpler conditions. Believes no innate tendency to progressive development exists.</p> 
<p>Hopes AH visits F. Hilgendorf’s famous deposit [at Steinheim]. A. Weismann [<hi rend="italic">Einfluss der Isolierung</hi> (1872)] makes good use of Hilgendorf’s observations.</p>

                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I thank you sincerely for yr most interesting letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You refer much too modestly to yr own knowledge &amp; judgement, as you are much better fitted to throw light on your own difficult problems than I am. It has quite annoyed me that I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not clearly understand your Prof. Cope’s views; &amp; the fault lies in some slight degree, I think, with Prof. Cope, who does not write very clearly.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I think I now understand the terms “acceleration &amp; retardation”; but will you grudge the trouble of telling me, by the aid of the following illustration, whether I do understand rightly? When a fresh-water, decapod crustacean is born with an almost mature structure, &amp; therefore does not pass, like other decapods, though the Zoea stage,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> is this not a case of acceleration? Again, if an imaginary decapod retained when adult many Zoea characters, w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> this not be a case of retardation? If these illustrations are correct I can perceive why I have been so dull in understanding your views: I looked for something else, being familiar with such cases, &amp; classing them in my own mind as simply due to the obliteration of certain larval or embryonic stages. This obliteration I imagined resulted somestimes entirely from that law of inheritance to which you allude;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> but that in many cases it was aided by natural selection, as I inferred from such cases occurring so frequently in terrestrial &amp; fresh-water members of groups, which retain their several embryonic stages in the sea, as long as fitting conditions are present.</p>
<p>Another cause of my misunderstanding was the assumption that in your series</p> 
<figure type="diagram"> 
<p>a–ab–abd– ae</p>
<p>–ad</p> </figure> 
<p rend="left">the differences between the successive species, expressed by the terminal letters, were due to “acceleration”: now if I understand rightly, this is not the case; &amp; such characters must have been independently acquired by some means.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>The two newest &amp; most interesting points in your letter (&amp; in as far as I remember your former paper) seem to me to be about senile characters in one species appearing in succeeding species, during maturity; &amp; secondly about certain degraded characters appearing in the last species of a series.— You ask for my opinion; but I can send only the conjectured impressions which have occurred to me, &amp; which are at most worth nothing. (It ought to be known whether the senile characters appear before or after the period of active reproduction) I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be inclined to attribute the characters in both your cases to the laws of growth &amp; quite secondarily to natural selection.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> It has been an error on my part &amp; a misfortune to me, that I did not largely discuss what I mean by laws of growth at an early period in some of my books. I have said something on this head in the new Chapt. in the last Edit. of the Origin.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be happy to send you a copy of this Edit, if you do not possess it &amp; care to have it. A man in extreme old age differs much from a young man, &amp; I presume every one would account for this by failing powers of growth. On the other hand the skulls of some mammals go on altering during maturity with advancing years,—as do the horns of stags, the tail-feathers of some birds, the size of fishes &amp;c; &amp; all such differences I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> attribute simply to the laws of growth, as long as full vigour was retained. Endless other changes of structure in successive species may I believe be accounted for by various complex laws of growth. Now any change of character thus induced with advancing years in the individual might easily be inherited at an earlier age than that at which it first supervened, &amp; thus become characteristic of the mature species; or again, such changes w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be apt to follow from variation, independently of inheritance, under proper conditions. Therefore I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> expect that characters of this kind w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> often appear in later-formed species without the aid of natural selection, or with its aid if the characters were of any advantage.</p>
<p>The longer I live the more I become convinced how ignorant we are of the extent to which all sorts of structures are serviceable to each species. But that characters supervening during maturity in one species sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> appear so regularly, as you state to be the case, in succeeding species seems to me very surprising &amp; inexplicable.</p>
<p>With respect to degradation in species towards the close of a series, I have nothing to say, except that before I arrived at the end of yr letter, it occurred to me that the earlier &amp; simpler ammonites must have been well adapted to their conditions, &amp; that when the species were verging towards extinction (owing probably to 〈th〉e presence of some more successful competitors) they w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> naturally become readapted to simpler conditions. Before I had read yr final remarks I thought also that unfavourable conditions might cause, thro’ the laws of growth, aided perhaps by reversion, degradation of character.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> No doubt many new laws remain to be discovered. Permit me to add that I have never been so foolish as to imagine that I have succeeded in doing more than to lay down some of the broad outlines of the origin of species. After long reflection I cannot avoid the conviction that no innate tendency to progressive development exists, as is now held by so many able naturalists, &amp; perhaps by yourself. It is curious how seldom writers define what they mean by progressive development; but this is a point which I have briefly discussed in the Origin.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I earnestly hope that you may visit Hilgendorf’s famous deposit.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Have you seen Weismann’s pamphlet “Einfluss der Isolirung” Leipzig 1872   He makes splendid use of Hilgendorf’s admirable observations.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have no strength to spare, being much out of health; otherwise I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have endeavoured to have made this letter better worth sending.</p>
<p>I most sincerely wish you success in yr valuable &amp; difficult researches &amp; I remain | my dear Sir | yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S I have received &amp; thank you for yr 3 pamphlets.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>As far as I can judge, yr views seem very probable; but what a fearfully intricate subject is this of the succession of Ammonites.</p>

Marine crabs typically pass through up to six zoeal stages followed by a final larval stage, the megalopa. Freshwater crabs lack free-living larval forms (zoea and megalopa), but pass through these stages during a prolonged embryonic period.</note>
