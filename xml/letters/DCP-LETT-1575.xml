<p>I had intended writing to tell you not to write, as I could not have the courage to leave home so soon as the next Hort. Meeting;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but I am glad I did not as I thus got your nice little note. I am really truly sorry to hear about your stomach. I <hi rend="underline">entreat</hi> you to write down your own case,—symptoms—&amp; habits of life, &amp; then consider your case as that of stranger; &amp; I put it to you, whether common sense w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not order you to take more regular exercise &amp; work your Brain less.— (N.B. take a cold bath &amp; walk before breakfast.) I am certain in the long run you would not lose time. Till you have a thoroughily bad stomach, you will not know the really great evil of it, morally physically &amp; every way. Do reflect &amp; act resolutely. Remember your troubled heart-action formerly plainly told how your constitution was tried.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But I will say no more, excepting that a man is mad to risk health, on which everything—including his <hi rend="underline">childrens inherited</hi> <hi rend="underline">health</hi>, depends.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Do not hate me for this lecture.—</p>
<p>Really I am not surprised at you having some headache after Thursday evening, for it must have been no small exertion making an abstract of all that was said after dinner.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Your being so engaged was a bore for there were several things that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have liked to have talked over with you. It was certainly, a first-rate dinner &amp; I enjoyed it extremely, <hi rend="underline">far more than I expected</hi>. Very far from disagreeing with me, my London visits have just lately taken to suit my stomach admirably;—I begin to think, that dissipation, high-living, with lots of claret is what I want, &amp; what I had during the last visit.— We are going to act on this same principle &amp; in a very profligate manner have just taken a pair of Season-tickets to see the Queen open the Crystal Palace.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> How I wish there was any chance of your being there. The last grand thing we were at together answered, I am sure, very well, &amp; that was the Duke’s Funeral.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Have you seen Forbes’ introduct. lecture in the Scotsman<ref target="#foot.f8"/> (lent me by Horner) it is really <hi rend="doubleUnderline">admirably</hi> done, though without anything, perhaps, very original, which could hardly be expected: it has given me even a higher opinion than I before had, of the variety &amp; polish of his intellect. It is, indeed, an irreparable loss to London Nat. History Society. I wish, however, he would not praise so much that old brown, dry stick Jameson.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Altogether to my taste it is much the best introductory lecture I have ever read.— I hear his Anniversary Address is very good.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Next year we really must go to Chiswick together.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> But this reminds me of what you said about changing your house;—an evil &amp; trouble for which I condole with you. I cannot think what you will do, if you get any Lectureship at Kew. When you have any definite news, please let me hear.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> You seem to be much on the move for the next few weeks.— I heartily wish for the Hitcham affair to be over.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Adios, my dear Hooker; do be wise &amp; good &amp; be careful of your stomach, within which, as I know full well, lie intellect, conscience, temper &amp; the affections.—</p>

His Admiralty grant for completing the botany of the Antarctic voyage, and one from the Department of woods and forests for arranging his Indian collection, were drawing to an end. Possibilities for a lectureship and for an assistantship at Kew were being explored. Only in May 1855 did his father succeed in obtaining an appointment for him as assistant director of the garden (L. Huxley ed. 1918, 1: 351–2).
