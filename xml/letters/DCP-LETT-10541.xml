<p>I am sorry to have bothered you to write me a note, as I’ve been to the Geolog. Soc. today on my own account &amp; consulted the book.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The paper is only an abstract of an address by Sir W. Thomson, but it touches on my point exactly.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I can see that he has attacked the problem from a different side from what I have done, and I am pretty confident that he has overlooked some considerations which I have taken in. I agree perfectly with all he says but one thing &amp; that makes a considerable difference. It’s rather like a pea meeting a cannon ball to oppose him, but I feel tolerably safe at present, &amp; if I am right it will be so much the greater triumph. I have succeeded too in emmensely simplifying some of the mathematics wh. I sent to Adams, &amp; tho’ the results are the same exactly as before, I’m rather ashamed of my clumsiness. It cuts about 5 pages down to one. If Adams has’nt read it when I get back, I shall get it from him &amp; interpolate.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Uncle Ras was remarkably brisk yesterday &amp; went down to the Athenæum, &amp; had actually accepted an invitation for dinner today; but last night at about 10 he was taken with an aguish fit &amp; today he seems very prostrate.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I was in the room for 10 minutes or so this morning &amp; he was talking for about 10 minutes, but this afternoon I went to see him for about two minutes &amp; he appeared quite unfit for anything &amp; so I shall not go in again. I can tell perfectly, now, when he likes talking &amp; I keep quite away when he does’nt so I feel sure my being here does’nt disturb him the least.</p>
<p>I think he likes the marriage on the whole, tho’ of course he is very sorry to lose Hope.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>What lovely weather the Thames party are having.</p>
<p>Tonight I dine with Elliot<ref target="#foot.f6"/> at the Club &amp; I think shall go to a French play. Tomorrow I’m going to see a conjuror at the Balfours<ref target="#foot.f7"/> who says she can do all the spiritualist’s tricks</p>
