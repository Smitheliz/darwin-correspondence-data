            <p>His discovery that in the binocular vision of the stereoscope faces can be blended with decided improvement in beauty. Suggests the possibility of experiments in thus photographing the faces of animals, different races and orders of men.</p>

<p>Although a perfect stranger to you, and living on the reverse side of the globe, I have taken the liberty of writing to you on a small discovery I have made in binocular vision in the stereoscope. I find by taking two ordinary <hi rend="italic">carte-de-visite</hi> photos of two different persons’ faces, the portraits being about the same sizes and looking about the same direction, and placing them in a stereoscope, the faces blend into one in a most remarkable manner, producing in the case of some ladies’ portraits in every instance a <hi rend="italic">decided improvement</hi> in beauty. The pictures were not taken in a binocular camera, and therefore do not stand out well, but by moving one or both until the eyes coincide in the stereoscope, the pictures blend perfectly. If taken in a binocular camera for the purpose, each person being taken on one half of the negative, I am sure the results would be still more striking. Perhaps something might be made of this in regard to the expression of emotions in man and the lower animals, &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have not time or opportunities to make experiments, but it seems to me something might be made of this by photographing the faces of different animals, different races of mankind, &amp;c. I think a stereoscopic view of one of the ape tribe and some low caste human face would make a very curious mixture; also in the matter of crossing of animals and the resulting offspring. It seems to me something also might result in photos of husband and wife and children, &amp;c. In any case the results are curious if it leads to nothing else. Should this come to anything you will no doubt acknowledge myself as suggesting the experiment and perhaps send me some of the results. If not likely to come to anything a reply would much oblige me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Yours very truly, | A. L. A<hi rend="smallCaps">ustin</hi>, C.E., F.R.A.S.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
