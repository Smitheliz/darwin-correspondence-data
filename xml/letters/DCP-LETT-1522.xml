<p>Here we are in a state of profound idleness, which to me is a luxury; &amp; we sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> all, I believe, have been in a state of high enjoyment, had it not been for the detestable cold gales &amp; much rain, which always gives much ennui to children, away from their homes.— I received your letter of the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of June when working like a slave with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Sowerby at drawing for my second volume, &amp; so put off answering it till when I knew I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be at leisure. I was extremely glad to get your letter: I had intended a couple of months ago sending you a savage or supplicating jobation to know how you were, when I met Sir P. Egerton,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> who told me you were well, &amp;, as usual, expressed his admiration of your doings, especially your farming &amp; the number of animals, including children, which you kept on your land.— Eleven children ave maria! it is a serious look out for you. Indeed I look at my five boys as something awful &amp; hate the very thought of professions &amp;c: if one could insure moderate health for them it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not signify so much, for I cannot but hope with the enormous emigration professions will somewhat improve. But my bug-bear is heredetary weakness. I particularly like to hear all that you can say about education: &amp; you deserve to be scolded for saying “you did not mean to <hi rend="underline">torment</hi> me with a long yarn”.—</p>
<p>You ask about Rugby:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I like it very well, on the same principle as my neighbour Sir J. Lubbock likes Eton, viz that it is not worse than any other school: the expence <hi rend="underline">with all &amp;c &amp;c</hi> including some clothes, travelling expences &amp;c is from <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>110 to <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>120 per annum: I do not think schools are so wicked as they were, &amp; far more industrious. The Boys, I think, live too secluded in their separate studies; &amp; I doubt whether they will get so much knowledge of character, as Boys used to do, &amp; this in my opinion is the <hi rend="underline">one</hi> good of public schools over small schools. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think the only superiority of a small school over home was forced regularity in their work, which your Boys perhaps get at your home, but which I do not believe my Boys w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. get at my home. Otherwise it is quite lamentable sending Boys so early in life from their home. I think of bringing up my eldest Boy as an Attorney; &amp; my second, who has a mechanical turn &amp; is very active minded, as an Engineer.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>To return to schools, my main objection to them, as places of education, is the enormous proportion of time spent over classics. I fancy, (though perhaps it is only fancy) that I can perceive the ill &amp; contracting effect on my eldest Boy’s mind, in checking interest in anything in which reasoning &amp; observation comes into play. mere memory seems to be worked.— I shall certainly look out for some school, with more diversified studies for my younger Boys.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I was talking lately to the Dean of Hereford,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> who takes most strongly this view: &amp; he tells me that there is a school at Hereford commencing on this plan: &amp; that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Kennedy at Shrewsbury is going to begin vigorously to modify that school; but I rather mistrust D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. K<hi rend="superscript">’s</hi>. judgment.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I have some fears whether any school will do for my second Boy, as his health has lately failed rather; &amp; a very irregular pulse, (though not resulting from any heart complaint) I fear shows that the weakness is deep-seated.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I am <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> glad to hear that you approved of my cirripedial volume:<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have spent an almost ridiculous amount of labour on the subject &amp; certainly w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. never have undertaken it, had I foreseen what a job it was: I hope to have finished by the end of the year.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Do write again before a very long time: it is a real pleasure to me to hear from you. Farewell with my wifes kindest remembrances to yourself &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Fox.</p>
<p>My dear old friend. Yours affectionately | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I am reading F. Galton’s book &amp; like it <hi rend="underline">very much</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>P.S. I had not sealed up this letter an hour, before I saw with the utmost concern &amp; astonishment the deaths in your house:<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I most deeply hope that your own children have escaped this most fearful illness. I did doubt about sending off this letter till knowing how your own children were; but it need not be read.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Do pray sometime tell me how far you have escaped. And I fear your wife must just have been confined.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
