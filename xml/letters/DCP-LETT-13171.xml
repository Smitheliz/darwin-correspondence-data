<p>I do not think my little essay needed an acknowledgement from you of so serious a tone as that which I have just received.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I feel honored by your intention to read my brochure on Steinheim Shells, and hope, that notwithstanding it’s imperfections, it may not entirely disappoint you.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>It would have been made much more perfect, if I had had the opportunity for revising all my conclusions by a third visit to Steinheim. I should then have done greater justice to Hilgendorf for whom I have such a high respect.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I cannot now take any other view than, that, he and those who support him have not had the opportunity of making themselves acquainted with the geological side of the question.</p>
<p>Certainly, if the conditions of the deposition of sediment are the same in European as in American lakes, I did reach as old a stratum as ever Hilgendorf did.</p>
<p>His claim, in that case, that I only reached a comparatively much younger stratum than he did falls to the ground. His claim is, that he sunk holes farther out from the old shore line and therefore pierced down to older strata where Pl. levis = Pl. Steinheim, var aequiumbilicatus existed alone without intermixture of other forms.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> You would think I was insincere, if I wrote you what I really felt with regard to what you have done for the theory of Descent.</p>
<p>Perhaps this essay will lead you to a more correct view, than you now have of my estimate, if I can be said to have any claim to make an estimate of your work in this direction.</p>
<p>You will not take offence however, if I tell you that your strongest supporters can hardly give you greater esteem, and honor.</p>
<p>I have striven to get a just idea of your theory, but no doubt have failed to convey this in my publications as it ought to be done.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>You certainly have explained to my mind the way in which differences arise, as I have tried to show in the essay you have; so far I have progressed, perhaps after one word awhile I may get better informed and see other applications. Do not think, I beg, that I consider I am able to fathom your books or your insight which I hold to be far beyond my plumb line.</p>
<p>Very respectfully | Alpheus Hyatt.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13151.xml">letter to Alpheus Hyatt, 8 May 1881</ref> and n. 1. The brochure was <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9270.xml">Hyatt 1880</ref>. Regarding the phylogeny of fossil snails found in the Steinheim crater in Heidenheim, Germany, Hyatt claimed that the whole series arose within a relatively short time in parallel lineages (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 106–11). Hyatt had given CD a long statement of his findings in a letter of <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10760.xml">January 1877</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 25).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In contrast to Hyatt, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2285.xml">Franz Hilgendorf</ref> had published a phylogeny of the Steinheim fossil shells in which different forms were associated with ten different strata and all forms ultimately traced back to one foundation species (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3657.xml">Hilgendorf 1866</ref>; see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9471.xml">Rasser 2013</ref>, pp. 10–12, for more on Hilgendorf’s conclusions on the phylogeny of the Steinheim shells).</note>

Hilgendorf’s foundation species name was <hi rend="italic">Planorbis multiformis aequiumbilicatus</hi> (both Hyatt’s and Hilgendorf’s names are synonyms of <hi rend="italic">Gyraulus kleini</hi>). In a letter published in the <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift der Deutschen Geologischen Gesellschaft</hi> 27 (1875): 224–7, Hilgendorf had suggested that the reason both Hyatt and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_7919.xml">Fridolin Sandberger</ref>, who had also written on the shells, found a mixture of forms in the same strata was that they had not sampled from the lowest undisturbed levels. Following the appearance of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9270.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Hyatt 1880</ref>, Hilgendorf wrote a review in which he extended his critique of Hyatt’s investigation, while noting some similarities in their classification systems (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11416.xml">Hilgendorf 1881</ref>).</note>
