                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>Busk and myself have made every effort to be back in London by the 27th. inst.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> but we have been persecuted by mishaps—through the breakdown of trains, diligences, &amp;c., so that we have been sadly put out in our reckoning—and have lost some of the main objects that brought us round by this part of France—none of which were idle or unimportant.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Busk started yesterday for Paris from Briunquel<ref target="#foot.f3"/> to make sure of being present at the meeting of the R. Council on Thursday.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He will tell you that there were strong reasons for my remaining behind him. But as I seconded the proposal of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin for the Copley Medal, in default of my presence at the first meeting, I beg that you will express my great regrets to the President and Council<ref target="#foot.f5"/> at not being there— and that I am very reluctantly detained. I shall certainly be in London (D.V.) by the second meeting on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> prox<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. Meanwhile I solicit the favour of being heard, through you, respecting the grounds upon which I seconded Mr. Darwin’s nomination for the Copley Medal.</p>
<p>Referring to the classified list—which I drew up<ref target="#foot.f6"/>—of Mr.  Darwin’s scientific labours, ranging through the wide field of 1. Geology; 2. Physical Geography; 3 Zoology; 4. Physiological Botany; 5 Genetic Biology;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> and to the power with which he has investigated whatever subject he has taken up, “Nullum tetegit quod non ornavit”<ref target="#foot.f8"/>   I am of opinion that Mr. Darwin is not only one of the most eminent naturalists of his day, but that hereafter he will be regarded as one of the <hi rend="underline">Great Naturalists</hi> <hi rend="underline">of all Countries and of all time</hi>. His early work on the structure and distribution of Coral reefs<ref target="#foot.f9"/> constitutes an era in the investigation of the subject. As a monographic labour it may be compared with Dr. Wells Essay upon Dew,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> as original, exhaustive and complete—containing the closest observation with large and important generalizations.</p>
<p>Among the Zoologists, his monographs upon the <hi rend="underline">Balanidæ</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Lepadidæ</hi>, Fossil and Recent in the Palæontographical and Ray Societies’ Publications<ref target="#foot.f11"/> are held to be models of their kind.</p>
<p>In Physiological Botany, his recent researches, upon the Dimorphism of the Genital organs in certain plants, embodied in his papers in the Linnean Journal, on <hi rend="underline">Primula</hi> <hi rend="underline">Linum</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Lythrum</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> are of the highest order of importance. They open a new mine of observation, upon a field which had been barely struck upon before. The same remark applies to his researches on the structure and various adaptations of the <hi rend="underline">Orchideous</hi> flower, to a definite object connected with impregnation of the plants through the agency of insects with foreign pollen.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> There has not yet been time for their due influence being felt in the advancement of the science. But in either subject, they constitute and advance <hi rend="underline">per saltum</hi>. I need not dwell upon the value of his Geological Researches, which won for him one of the earlier awards of the “Wollaston Medal”—from the Geological Society—the best of judges on the point.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>And lastly Mr. Darwin’s great essay on the Origin of Species by Natural Selection. This solemn and mysterious subject had been either so lightly or so grotesquely treated before, that it was hardly regarded as being within the bounds of legitimate philosophical investigation. Mr. Darwin after 20 years of the closest study and research, published his views, and it is sufficient to say that they instantly fixed the attention of mankind throughout the civilized world. That the efforts of a single mind should have arrived at success on a subject of such vast scope, and encompassed with such difficulties was more than could have been reasonably expected—and I am far from thinking that Charles Darwin has made out all his case. But he has treated it with such power and in such a philosophical and truth-seeking spirit and illustrated it with such a vast amount of original and collated observation, as fairly to have brought the subject within the bounds of rational scientific research. I consider this great essay on <hi rend="underline">Genetic Biology</hi> to constitute a strong additional claim on behalf of Mr. Darwin for the Copley Medal.</p>
<p>In forming an estimate of the value and extent of Mr. Darwin’s researches, due regard ought to be had to the circumstances under which they have been carried out—a pressure of unremitting disease—which has latterly left him not more than one or two hours of the day which he could call his own.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Busk and Falconer were returning from a visit to Gibraltar to examine the geology of Genista Cave, Windmill Hill, and the fossil remains recently recovered from it; Busk gave an account of the trip to the Philosophical Club of the Royal Society on 27 October 1864 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_789.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bonney 1919</ref>, p. 168, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4645.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 26[–8] October 1864</ref>). The expedition was financed by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4605.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, [1 September 1864]</ref> and n. 11, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2434.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Falconer 1868</ref>, 2: 554–63). On the return journey, Busk and Falconer evidently intended to visit natural history museums and archaeological sites in France, including the cave of Les Eyzies in the Dordogne, which had recently been explored by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_925.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Henry Christy</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2819.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edouard Lartet</ref>, and had yielded what Lartet regarded as some of the earliest known examples of Stone Age engravings, and the cave at Bruniquel (see letters from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1585.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hugh Falconer</ref> to Grace Milne, 5 October 1864 and 19 October 1864, the Falconer Museum, Forres, Scotland, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2434.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Falconer 1868</ref>, 2: 627–8).

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Bruniquel, a town in Tarn-et-Garonne, forty-one miles east of Montauban in the south of France, was the site of a cave rich in artefacts of early humans, including weapons and implements. These archaeological finds had already been purchased by the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8646.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">British Museum</ref> and formed part of the national collections (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2434.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Falconer 1868</ref>, 2: 630–1).
