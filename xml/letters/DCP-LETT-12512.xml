                    <p>I have re-read my letter dated Mar 7 1878 &amp; have nothing to withdraw.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I may add that I have read two letters published by strangers in a Belfast newspaper, who declare, after examining M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torbitt’s ten-acre field, that there is the greatest difference between the several varieties in their liability to the disease, &amp; that some seem to have quite escaped.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torbitt himself assures me that some of the varieties are entirely free from the fungus, both in their foliage &amp; tubers. But as young varieties seem to resist the disease better than those which have been long cultivated, it is especially desirable that these should be cultivated for several more generations, &amp; that fresh seedlings should be raised from them. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torbitt informs me that his business has been so unprofitable of late that he cannot continue his experiments, which are, &amp; must be, very expensive, by his own means alone, as he had originally hoped to do.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>I may repeat my conviction that no one else is likely to undertake so laborious a task as the selection &amp; cross-fertilization of the plant during many successive generations. As this letter may be seen by strangers, I will add that I have no sort of pecuniary interest in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torbitt’s success. He is personally unknown to me, but his letters have inspired me with so much confidence, &amp; his plan seems so much more hopeful than any which has ever been tried, that I have been glad to aid him to a small extent with funds.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p> 
                    <p>Unless M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Torbitt is assisted <hi rend="underline">immediately</hi> with a few hundred pounds, he will be compelled, as he informs me, to sell his whole stock of potatoes; &amp; this to the best of my judgment would be a national misfortune &amp; disgrace</p>
<p>Charles Darwin</p>
