<p>Your letter interested us much; for we are all curious to see how things look to you all, &amp; a letter is something living.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But first thanks for your new cases of Dimorphism: new cases are tumbling in almost daily, but I shall never have time to work a quarter of them. You will have received before this my Primula paper,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; will know the amount of evidence.— I have been ill with influenza (indeed we all have, for there have been 15 in bed in my household) &amp; this has lost me 3 whole weeks, &amp; delayed my little Orchid Book.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I fear that you expect in this opusculus much more than you will find— I look at it as a hobby-horse, which has given me great pleasure to ride. I will with great pleasure send you the sheets if I can; for Clowes, my printer, often does not print off till the whole is set up.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I shall be very curious to hear what you think of it; for I have no idea whether it has been worth the trouble of getting up,—though the facts, I am sure, were worth <hi rend="underline">my own</hi> while in making out—</p>
<p>I am heartily glad to hear a better account of Dana, whom I much respect. What a striking looking man!<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I forwarded your letter to Boott &amp; to Hooker, from whom I had a long &amp; capital letter this morning.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> He is working like a Horse. Here is a good joke, my book on Nat. Selection, he says, has made him an aristocrat in fact— he thinks breeding—the high breeding of the aristocracy—of the highest importance.—</p>
<p>Now for a few words on politics; but they shall be few, for we shall no longer agree, &amp; alas &amp; alas, I shall never receive another kind message from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Gray.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I must own that the speeches &amp; actions recently of your leading men (I regard little the newspapers), and especially the Boston Dinner have quite turned my stomach. I refer to Wilkes’ being made a Hero for boarding an unarmed vessel.—to the Judges advice to him—&amp; to your Governor triumphing at a shot being fired, right or wrong, across the bows of a British vessel.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> It is well to make a clean breast of it at once; &amp; I have begun to think whether it would not be well for the peace of the world, if you were split up into two or three nations. On the other hand I cannot bear the thought of the Slave-holders being triumphant; &amp; it is really fearful to think of the difficulty of making a line of separation between the N. &amp; the S., with armies, fortifications, &amp; custom-houses without end with your retrograde tariff. Now I have done for myself in your eyes; &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Gray will be indignant at having sent a kind message to so false a caitiff.—</p>
<p>Well I can’t help my change of opinion— It is all owing to that confounded Longitude.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Bad man, as you will think me, I shall always think of you with affection.— Here is an insult! I shall always think of you as an Englishman.</p>
<p>Ever yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S | I have just performed an Herculean labour in looking through the nine big volumes of Lecoq’s Bot. Geograph.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> it is a horrid dull Book, but I have stumbled on a few good facts; &amp; on some cases of dimorphism,—several in Borragineæ &amp; Labiatæ— Lythrum seems a very curious case for the two or three kinds of flowers occur on the same plant.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I am now trying an experiment on one of the Melastomas; &amp; I much suspect, that the two sets of anthers have different functions.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Hottonia is dimorphic like Primula.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>

A dinner in honour of Wilkes was held in Boston on 26 November, the details of which were reported in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 10 December 1861, p. 9. Several speeches were made, praising Wilkes’s action. The judge, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_443.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Tyler Bigelow</ref>, called upon to give a legal opinion on the case, advised: ‘England, unless she falsifies her own conduct, unless she falsifies the statements of her own statesmen, unless she sets aside the judgments of her own judiciary, cannot undertake to make an issue with us upon this great act.’ He went on to state that it was acceptable to regard the envoys as ‘contraband of war’. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_119.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Albion Andrew</ref>, governor of Massachusetts, also gave a eulogy, in which he said: ‘And that there might be nothing left to crown the exultation of the American heart, Commodore Wilkes fired his shot across the bows of the ship that bore the British lion at its head’.
