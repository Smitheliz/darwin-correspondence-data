<p>You will probably be surprised, after the long intermission of our acquaintance, at receiving a note from me; but I last night finished your volume with such lively interest, that I cannot resist the temptation of expressing my admiration at your expedition, &amp; at the capital account you have published of it.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have no doubt you have received praise, from so many good judges, that you will hardly care to hear from me, how very much I admire the spirit &amp; style of your book. What labours &amp; dangers you have gone through: I can hardly fancy how you can have survived them, for you did not formerly look very strong, but you must now be as tough as one of your own African waggons!—</p>
<p>If you are inclined at any time to send me a line, I should very much like to hear what your future plans are, &amp; where you intend to settle.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I so very seldom leave home, owing to my weakened health (though in appearance a strong man) that I have had hardly a chance of seeing you in London, though I have often heard of you from members of the Geographical Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>.—</p>
<p>I live at a village called Down near Farnborough in Kent, &amp; employ myself in Zoology; but the objects of my study are very small fry, &amp; to a man accustomed to rhinoceroses &amp; lions, would appear infinitely insignificant.</p>
<p>We have come to this for a few weeks for sea-bathing with all our children, now numbering seven.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. much like to hear something about your brothers, Darwin &amp; Erasmus:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I very distinctly remember a pleasant visit at the Larches,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Heaven knows, how many years ago, &amp; having many rides with them on Ponies, without stirrups.— The only member of your family whom I have seen for years, is Emma, who gave myself &amp; wife a very cordial greeting at the British Assoc: at Birmingham, some few years ago.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I do not know, whether I ought not to apologise for troubling you with this note, but the spirit which makes me write, must be my excuse.</p>
<p>Pray believe me | Yours sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
