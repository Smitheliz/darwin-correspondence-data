<p>I am much obliged to you for your kind letter dated the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inst<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> In addition to being a large Sheep &amp; Cattle breeder I am actively engaged in heavy professional duties as a Solicitor &amp; am consequently unable to devote much time to continuous thought— I am however in the habit of noting facts &amp; circumstances as they arise; &amp; as I avail myself of the pen of a clerk who takes down my letters in Shorthand it will be no trouble to me to send you any information of note, as I may from time to time obtain it. Please however do not trouble to acknowledge it, as I well know the labour of correspondence to gentlemen who are in the habit of devoting their mental faculties to hard 〈    〉</p>
<p>〈    〉 last two Volumes have 〈inter〉ested me very much.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> 〈Yo〉u are probably aware that a Swiss Gentleman some time ago started a theory as to the production, at Will, of male or female Calves</p>
<p>His point was, if I remember right, this; Cows served immediately on coming in Season produced females, whilst those served later produced males.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I have endeavoured to test this theory closely for the last 2 or 3 years &amp; my experience leads me to think that there is nothing whatever in the theory.</p>
<p>I have, as before stated, had a singular preponderance of Bull Calves notwithstanding that the greatest possible care has been taken to have the Cow served immediately on her becoming in Season.</p>
<p>My friend M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. E. Bowly<ref target="#foot.f4"/> of Siddington near Cirencester is now I believe the oldest Shorthorn breeder living &amp; his experience has been like mine.</p>
<p>He told me a short time since that a person once professed to have discovered the Secret of breeding cow Calves, but refused to disclose it save on the condition of having £10,000 deposited under an arrangement which provided that it should be paid to him in case of the experiment being decided &amp; approved by competent judges.</p>
<p>The theory was however doubted from the beginning &amp; the proposed arrangement consequently not carried out.</p>
<p>I am dear Sir | Your’s faithfully | Jn<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> Harward <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
