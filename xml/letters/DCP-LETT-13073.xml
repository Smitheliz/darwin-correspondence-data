<p>I hope that the news in this note will please you. It gives me extreme pleasure to be the channel of communication. But I will narrate things historically.— A few weeks before coming to London M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich mentioned in a letter that he intended to bequeath, or had done so (I could not make out which) his house, with all its appurtenances &amp; the adjoining field to you.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I could not make out whether he expected me to answer his letter, &amp; whether he gave me the information as a secret. He said that he thought that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. find his house useful for your Fishery work. So I thought that I had better wait, until I had seen you.— On leaving you on Sunday I wrote him a long letter explaining your new duties &amp; told him that though I did not doubt that 〈much〉 sea-fishery work would be (&amp; had already been) thrown on your shoulders, I did not suppose that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> require a sea-side house for your work. I added that you took your family most years to the sea-side, &amp; that I felt sure that you would value highly such a bequest if he made it.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I did not of course say so, but I fancy you could let the house well for the winter to respectable persons &amp; if sold I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be astounded if it did not realise at least £3000. No doubt M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich likes the idea of your keeping the house at least for some time.— Well to go on with my narrative: he answered my London letter at once &amp; said that he had already added the Codicil to his will, leaving the House &amp; furniture &amp; land to you, but with a certain proviso about his sister which is explained in the letter dated March I.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>The first sheet of the letter 〈h〉as not been sent as it related only to myself.—</p>
<p>I did not feel positive whether he wished me to communicate this information to you, so without losing a post, I wrote suggesting to him that he had better enjoy the pleasure of communicating direct to you. But as you will see in enclosed letter, dated March 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, he generously wishes me to do so.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> It is a very nice letter &amp; every word of it true.—</p>
<p>I hope that I have made everything clear.— More than once he has expressed to me a strong wish to see you again, but with much modesty declared that he could not endure the thought of asking you again. I told him that I well remembered your saying that you had enjoyed your visit to him &amp; that if you could find the time w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. run down again.— I told him in my Sunday letter how hard you were worked, &amp; that we had asked you to come here &amp; that you could not possibly find the time.—</p>
<p>The bequest is but a small one, but I hope that the feeling which has prompted it will please you.</p>
<p>I do not require to be reminded by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Rich how much I owe to you for your uniform friendship &amp; kindness to me.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>My dear Huxley | Ever yours affectionately | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I have registered this to prevent any chance of loss.— You no doubt will write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> R.— So will I just telling him that I have communicated with you.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
