<p>I am sorry for your sake to say I <hi rend="underline">must</hi> write at considerable Length.— First would you object to send me list of the 12 superior men:<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I had made up my mind with you about the Pres. G. Soc.<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. <ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Secondly: here is to me a calamity, I have sent to Edinburgh for the “Lawsonian Collection &amp;c”<ref target="#foot.f3"/> it is “<hi rend="underline">quite out of print</hi>”. Now can Sir William lend me any old copy: the first Edit. would do perfectly; I say <hi rend="underline">old</hi>, for I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like, <hi rend="underline">if permitted</hi>, to make slight (to be afterwards rubbed out) pencil-marks to guide my inspection at Kew?— It is a real misfortune that I cannot buy a copy.— By the way Berkerly <hi rend="underline">most kindly</hi> has sent me some of the curious, <hi rend="underline">self</hi>-hybridised (the ticket at Kew gave me a false impression) Peas<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; some other vars: so that I shall now have 45 vars. of Peas growing by the side of each other!</p>
<p>Thirdly, if D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Alexander<ref target="#foot.f5"/> can give no more information, the case even for <hi rend="underline">credulous</hi> me, is worthless; I have constantly observed eggs of some parasite adhering to the bodies of Nepa, a <hi rend="underline">water-bug</hi>, if the Lady uses the terms correctly, it is perhaps these ova, &amp; not of Fish.—</p>
<p>Fourthly. Thank you very much for the information about the seeds.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I had fancied you had some definite opinion that seeds of certain groups could not possibly withstand salt-water. I am not yet prepared to try the experiment on so large a scale as you suggest: indeed I have hardly the means; but I am glad to find I have commenced very much on the principles you suggest, but on a much smaller scale. I have had one experiment some little time in progress, which will I think be interesting, namely seeds in salt water immersed in water of 32<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>–33<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>, which I have &amp; shall long have, as I filled a great tank with Snow.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> When I wrote last, I was going to triumph over you, for my experiment had in a slight degree succeeded, but this with infinite baseness I did not tell in hopes that you would say that you would eat all the plants, which I could raise after immersion. It is very aggravating that I cannot in the least remember what you did formerly say, that made me think you scoffed at the experiments vastly; for you now seem to view the experiment like a good Christian.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have in small bottles out of doors, exposed to variations of temp., but in shade, exposed to light, as yet only Cress, Radish, Cabbages, Lettuces, Carrots, Celery, &amp; Onion seed; 4 great Families. These after immersion for exactly one week, have all germinated, which I did not in the least expect, (&amp; thought how you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. sneer at me) for the water of nearly all &amp; of the cress especially, smelt very badly, &amp; the cress-seed emitted a wonderful quantity of mucus (the Vestiges would have expected them to turn into tadpoles)<ref target="#foot.f9"/> so as to cohere in a mass; but these seeds germinated &amp; grew splendidly. The germination of all (especially Cress &amp; Lettuces) has been accelerated, except the cabbages, which have come up very irregularly &amp; a good many, I think, dead. One w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have thought from native habitat that cabbage w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have stood well. The Umbelliferæ &amp; onions seem to stand the salt well. I wash the seed before planting them. I have written to Gardeners’ Chronicle;<ref target="#foot.f10"/> though I doubt whether it was worth while. If my success seems to make it worth while, I will send a seed list to get you to mark some different classes of seeds. To day I replant the same seeds as above after 14 days immersion.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> As many sea-current go a mile an hour: even in a week they might be transported 168 miles: the Gulf-stream is said to go 50 &amp; 60 miles a day.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> So much &amp; too much on this head; but my geese are always swans.—</p>
<p>I have made, at cost of more trouble than worth, a list of all the naturalised plants from A. Gray<ref target="#foot.f13"/> to calculate proportions of the great Families, as I did from the Cybele:<ref target="#foot.f14"/> as you seemed to think this of some interest; I do not scruple to ask you to deliberately read over the enclosed papers;<ref target="#foot.f15"/> for Gray uses so many different expressions that I am puzzled what to do, &amp; am afraid of being biassed from theory in any selection. Please read heading. The expressions are exactly copied. There is from context, no essential difference between “introduced” &amp; “naturalised”. I have doubted whether to take <hi rend="underline">whole list</hi>, as it stands or to strike out those with (?) or clear doubt expressed. Once I thought of selecting those best &amp; most thoroughily naturalised; but this would be difficult to do &amp; the number left would be few. If I were to make any selection, I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. pin paper over names, shuffle the papers &amp; so not be biassed. will you <hi rend="underline">deliberate</hi> &amp; advise me: I will send you the results, if you like to have them. I have had to count all the species: ill-luck to the labour.— I am thinking of writing with many apologies to A. Gray to ask him a few questions on alpine plants &amp;c.—<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>Goodbye | My dear Hooker | Most truly yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I plant my salted seeds in glass tumblers (having first tried &amp; recorded rate of germination of same seeds unsalted) so that I can see the seed all the time, before &amp; after germination, on the chimney piece.—</p>
