<p>Though it is not my <hi rend="underline">turn</hi> to write to you I cannot resist the opportunity of sending you my very best love— I was so glad to get your last letter of November 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> with such a happy account of yourself &amp; I must congrat— you on being so successful and persevering in collecting I shall be very curious to read in your journal how you first heard of the Megatherium Coat &amp; whether it is a part that has not before been sent to England— I thought I had heard M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sedgwick say some specimen of the coat was now in England—</p>
<p>We heard of you a few days later than your letter again through M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hughes who seems to envy you your expedition his own life must be dull enough to be sure— I am so happy to be able to give you such a nice account of my Father he is looking very well &amp; though since you went his powers of moving about, walking &amp;<hi rend="superscript">tc</hi> are very much gone he is in every other respect quite like himself, he sees hardly any patients &amp; refuses going to any distance but he amuses himself very well &amp; his eyes from habit are not so soon tired by reading as they were formerly, we go on in the old way having our game of whist &amp; Cassino every evening—</p>
<p>Charlotte Holland is to be married on the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of this month to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Isaac Emma Wedgwood is to be one of the Brides maids &amp; go back with Louisa H. to London— I expect Erasmus will be a very attentive Cavalier to her &amp; nobody knows what will be the end of the drives in his Cab he will take her to &amp; fro Clapham where the Hensleigh Wedgwoods live— there will be quite a new race sprung up before you return little Hensleighs &amp; little Franks— Charlotte Langton says she almost rejoices to hear the expedition is to last 5 years longer as she thinks there is greater chance of your not staying all the time but I hope the report we heard was false of the time being lengthened— How anxious &amp; impatient we shall be for your next letter after your cold Patagonian voyage my dear Charles it is such a happiness that your health bears what you go through— I wish I could think of any more home details— Mark has a very pretty little baby— Old Pincher is very well— I ride now the Grey you had from Joseph &amp; like him very much</p>
<p>I am going to Maer tomorrow—such a small party—Uncle Jos being in London &amp; Emma away. Uncle Jos stands the fatigue of Parliamt very well &amp; I think writes in spirits as if he liked the life— he says 19 out of 20 of the speeches are very dull. he is a staunch supporter of Ministry &amp; is very bitter against the Radicals All parties seem to agree that some strong measure in favor of Emancipation of the Slaves will be carried this session &amp; I am sure that alone is enough to make one value the present Ministers—</p>
<p>Your journal is quite safe &amp; we are far from thinking you over careful in being most anxious it should not be lost but pray be at ease it shall be taken the greatest care of— I had &amp; so had my father &amp; all of us so much pleasure &amp; interest in reading it.</p>
<p>Good bye My very dear Charles and God bless you Sitting &amp; writing in this old school room makes me feel so Motherly to you dear Tactus— Y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. vy affecly | Caroline Darwin</p>
