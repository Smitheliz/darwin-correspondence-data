<p>Many thanks for your kind letter which I received last night.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I answer it at once because I think it fair to ask you frankly which translator you would prefer for your work. After consideration I see I can manage it to have the first volume ready for November, so that the first half of the translation can be published at the same time with the whole of the original〈.〉 But as C. Vogt offered himself to do it, it depends, at least as far as the publishers will arrange it, on your will.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> C. Vogt has most certainly a greater name than I. But by his unmeasured satyrical and I am sorry to say sometimes quite cynical extravagances he lost a good deal of the influence, his judgement could otherwise still have. Although I am not impartial, yet I don’t think for the reason just mentioned that he is the fit person to introduce your work to the German public.</p>
<p>Just now he travels over Germany and delivers lectures like a travelling preacher, but not “ad propagandam fidem”, but in favour of the materialism in the absurdest form.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I trust you understand me. I should most gladly desist from translating your work if you find an abler man to do it. But on the other hand I should be sorry for your work’s sake, if it should be associated with the name of a man, who would contrast by his fighting and scoulding manners most singularly with the sober and earnest tenor of a book full of observations. I know, many of our younger naturalists are losing that feeling of scientific decency which according to 〈my〉 opinion is utterly indispensable with a true mind of research. Yet I should not think that I am standing alone with the judgment given above. Now you will decide and let me kindly know your will</p>
<p>I am very happy to see that you agree with me about Haeckel’s book.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Believe my dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Prof J. Victor Carus</p>

It was eventually published on 30 January 1868 (CD’s ‘Journal’ (Appendix II)). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4902.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Carl Vogt</ref> had also offered to translate <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5495.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Carl Vogt, 8 April 1867</ref>), and CD had written to him on 12 April [1867], suggesting that if Carus was too busy to make the translation, Vogt might do it instead.
