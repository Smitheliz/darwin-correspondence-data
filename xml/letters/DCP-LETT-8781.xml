                    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>We held our annual Meeting in London last Saturday, which was well attended, &amp; of a most cordial &amp; unanimous character.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>The two chief points of interest were the declaration of a Dividend of 6 per cent, &amp; the election of a new Director in the person of J. Thornton Hoskins Esq MA. of 9 Prince of Wales Terrace, Kensington W, who holds <hi rend="underline">120</hi> shares.</p>
<p>I have much pleasure in handing you a copy of the new Report Balance Sheet, which I am sure you will peruse with great interest &amp; satisfaction. Our paid up Capital (now exceeding £52<hi rend="superscript">.</hi>000) has been trebled during the past year, &amp; has been considerably increased during the past fortnight, several of the leading Shareholders having doubled &amp; some trebled their holdings, in appreciation of the sound &amp; satisfactory Financial condition of the Company.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Special reference is due to the London estate of the <hi rend="underline">1200</hi> Houses we are building, we expect <hi rend="underline">500</hi> will be ready for occupation by the end of August. We have already <hi rend="underline">600</hi> Applicants upon our Books, of which number many intend to <hi rend="underline">purchase</hi> their Houses. This is highly gratifying, for whilst it shows that the Working men cordially appreciate the opportunity we afford them of becoming the Owners of their Houses, it effectually secures the Company against any possible risk.</p>
<p>I beg to hand you a copy Report recently made upon our Manchester Houses by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hollis<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Agent to the Reverend Walter Sneyd MA. JP. of 55 Portland Place W. who has just added his name for <hi rend="underline">40</hi> shares to our List. I am sure it will please you very much.</p>
<p>Your Dividend Warrant will be forwarded from the Head office in a few days.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>We require further Capital to carry out our projected Works. May I ask you kindly to increase your shares to fifteen, or Twenty?<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am confident Capital cannot be more safely invested or more effectually made the instrument of ministering to the common good of the Industrious Classes.</p>
<p>I take the liberty to hand you an autograph note from Professor Geikie FRS. of Edinburgh, who has just increased his shares to <hi rend="underline">15</hi>. May I ask you kindly to return it with your valued reply?<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I beg to remain, Sir, | Your Most Humble &amp; Obliged | Servant. | J Royle Martin. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
