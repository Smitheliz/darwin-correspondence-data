<p>F. J. Muñiz has offered fossil bones collected around Buenos Aires to the Royal College of Surgeons. He believes he can complete their <hi rend="italic">Megatherium</hi> skeleton and provide other specimens. CD feels he should be encouraged in his work.</p>

<p>I have received a letter &amp; parcel of Papers from S. F. Muniz,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> the gentleman who has made such wonderful collections of Fossil Bones near B. Ayres. His letter has been unfortunately lying for nearly four months in London. It is to offer to the College of Surgeons various fossils, completing, as he believes, the skeletons collected by me;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> also an apparently nearly perfect skeleton of a new genus of carnivora, but which I have no doubt is the Machairodus. Also those parts of the Megatherium, wanting in the Skeleton at the College.— <hi rend="underline">He desires that the parts most wanted</hi> of the Megatherium <hi rend="underline">may</hi> <hi rend="underline">be specified</hi>. Will you do this? I presume if he ships the specimens at B. Ayres, &amp; sends a letter directed to the Curator of the College; they will come safe to hand. But I should think it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be highly desirable to offer to pay, if he will point out a channel, for the expences of the Boxes, the land-carriage about 20 or 30 miles, to B. Ayres, &amp; getting them on board. If S. Muniz is encouraged, he will very probably send other things. Would it not be well to offer him copies of some of the College publications? I shall send him my Geology</p>
<p>It is really very remarkable considering this man’s utterly isolated position &amp; that he must be poor, being a medical practioner in the village of Luxan, that he keeps his zeal up: he has sent me a Spanish newspaper with a long description of the Machairodus,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; which I hope to get translated &amp; if so I will send it to you. To encourage him, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to get his paper in some of the Journals.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>W<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. you let me have an answer pretty soon; though I presume you will have to lay the offer before the Museum Committee.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> What a grand feature a skeleton of the Machairodus would be!—</p>
<p>Have you heard whether any collection of bones from B. Ayres has been received at Paris?? Muniz sent one by Admiral Dupotet<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; is <hi rend="underline">anxious</hi> to know whether they ever arrived.—</p>
<p>I have just read your first Chapter &amp; have been delighted with it. Those vertebræ are awfully difficult to understand.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Believe me | Very truly yours, | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S I did not take advantage of your kind suggestion about applying for a specimen of an Acasta to the College, as I have got some fresh British specimens.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
