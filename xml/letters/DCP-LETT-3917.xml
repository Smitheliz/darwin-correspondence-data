<p>Thanks AdeC for his memoir ["Étude sur l’espèce", <hi rend="italic">Ann. Sci. Nat. (Bot.)</hi> 4th ser. 18 (1862): 59–110].</p> 
            <p>CD astonished at the amount of variability in the oaks.</p>
            <p>CD differs from most contemporaries in thinking that the vast continental extensions of Forbes, Heer, and others are not only advanced without sufficient evidence but are opposed to much weighty evidence.</p> 
<p>AdeC’s comment on CD’s work [<hi rend="italic">Origin</hi>] is generous.</p>  
<p>CD is satisfied at the length AdeC goes with him and is not surprised at his prudent reservations. He remembers how many years it took him to change his old beliefs. The great point is to give up immutability. So long as species are thought immutable there can be no progress in "epiontology" [see <hi rend="italic">ML</hi> 1: 234 n.]. CD is sure to be proved wrong in many points but the subject will have "a grand future".</p>

<p>I thank you most sincerely for sending me your Memoir.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have read it with the liveliest interest, as is natural for me; but you have the art of making subjects, which might be dry, run easily. I have been fairly astonished at the amount of individual variability in the oaks.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I never saw before the subject in any department of nature worked out so carefully. I noted with delight case of achenia &amp;c &amp;c.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> What labour it must have cost you! You spoke in one letter of advancing years; but I am very sure that no one would have suspected that you felt this.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have been interested with every part; though I am so unfortunate as to differ from most of my contemporaries in thinking the the vast continental extensions of Forbes, Heer &amp; others are not only advanced without sufficient evidence, but are opposed to much weighty evidence.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>You refer to my work in the kindest &amp; most generous spirit.— I am fully satisfied at the length in belief to which you go, &amp; not at all surprised at the prudent reservations which you make.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I remember well how many years it cost me to go round from old beliefs. It is encouraging to me to observe that everyone who has gone an inch with me; after a period goes a few more inches or even feet.— But the great point, as it seems to me, is to give up the immutability of specific forms; as long as they are thought immutable, there can be no real progress in ‘epiontology”.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> It matters very little to anyone except myself, whether I am a little more or less wrong on this or that point; in fact I am sure to be proved wrong in many points. But the subject will have, I am convinced, a grand future.—</p>
<p>Considering that Birds are the most isolated group in the animal kingdom, what a splendid case is this Solenhofen bird-creature with its long tail &amp; fingers to its wings!<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have lately been daily &amp; hourly using &amp; quoting your Geograph. Bot., in my book on “Variation under Domestication”.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>with cordial thanks &amp; sincere respect | I remain Dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">A. de Candolle 1862a. At some point, CD also received A. de Candolle 1862b, a shorter notice on oaks. Candolle originally undertook the review of <hi rend="italic">Quercus</hi>, the oak genus, and its relatives, as part of his work for <hi rend="italic">Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis</hi> (A. P. de Candolle and A. de <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1215.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Candolle 1824–73</ref>). In his letter of 18 September 1862 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10), Candolle promised CD copies of the publications on <hi rend="italic">Quercus.</hi> CD’s annotated copies of Candolle’s accounts of the oak family are in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD cited A. de Candolle 1862a in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 387, in regard to changes in oaks with age.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD refers to the discussion of the acorn in A. de Candolle 1862a, pp. 222–5; this section is heavily annotated in CD’s copy of the work, which is in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">For Candolle’s discussion of the distribution of the Cupuliferae, see A. de Candolle 1862a, pp. 326–53. CD refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1680.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Forbes’s</ref> account of European flora and fauna distribution patterns, in which he proposed that in the Miocene era there existed a land-bridge connecting the Iberian peninsula with the Azores and with Ireland (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2580.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">E. Forbes 1846</ref>). Similarly, working on the biogeography of Madeira, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2199.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Oswald Heer</ref> invoked the theory of a former land-extension linking that island with the European mainland (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3481.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Heer 1855</ref>). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref> was also a supporter of a land-bridge theory, and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref> used it to explain distribution patterns in the southern Pacific (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3746.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D. Hooker 1844–7</ref> and 1853–5). CD did not completely oppose the concept of land-bridges and accepted, for example, the probability that such a connection formerly linked North America and Asia. However, he vigorously criticised what he thought was the <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> invocation of former land-extensions, even former continents, without fully considering other means that might account for observed plant and animal distributions. CD had been debating the land-bridge theory with Hooker since 1846 and with Lyell since 1856 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vols. 3 and 6).

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">A. de Candolle 1862a, pp. 354–61, 363. Candolle described CD’s account of the origin of species as the most modern, and, at the same time, the most ingenious and complete of the systems founded on what he termed an ‘évolution’ of organised beings over the course of time (A. de Candolle 1862a, p. 354). His reservations concerned what he saw as a lack of direct evidence that natural selection was the only means by which modified forms were slowly changed through what seemed to be confoundingly vast periods of time (A. de Candolle 1862a, pp. 358–61, 363). See <hi rend="italic">Intellectual Observer</hi> 3 (1863): 81–6, for a translation of the last portion of A. de Candolle 1862b.

            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Attempting to unify biogeography and the ‘geography of organic beings’, Candolle defined ‘épiontologie’ as the study of the distribution and succession of organised beings from their origin up to the present time (A. de Candolle 1862a, pp. 363–5).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">CD refers to the reptile-like fossil bird <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi>, found in the Jurassic rocks of the Solenhofen quarries, Bavaria, in 1861. See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3899.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Hugh Falconer, 3 January [1863]</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">On 21 December 1862, CD began the chapter of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> discussing bud-variation (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, Appendix II).
