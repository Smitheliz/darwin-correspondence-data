<p>Please thank Mr Darwin for sending me his book, it was very kind indeed of him.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have not been able to do more than look at the plates, because Mr Cupples<ref target="#foot.f3"/> walked it off, and a minister here has got the promise of it after him, all without my leave in the matter. I have written to Aberfoyle to make inquiries about the dog who howls to the music<ref target="#foot.f4"/>   Miss Glen<ref target="#foot.f5"/> is a person to be relied upon, and I have given her instructions, and told her to be <hi rend="underline">very</hi> particular. I cannot say for certain about the puckering up of the eyes or face   my <hi rend="underline">impression</hi> is it simply winked its eye lids very fast, as one would do if hammering was going on, and that the eyes ran with or, were filled with moisture like a person crying, but Miss Glen will be able to tell us. After your letter came I remembered a young lady having told me their dog howled when particular tunes were played so I went off to see it, but after walking three miles I was told it was a dog they <hi rend="underline">once</hi> had and that it was in Campbelton.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> She told me their ministers wife said their dog howled so off we set to get the dog, for in this case the minister had no piano, but we were told she ment her dog at home, her mothers dog in fact at Stirling.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Then the minister who is a great wag began to tell me about a wonderful dog in St Andrews who used to pull the bell, and not only howl to music but played the piano and howled to his own playing. So I set off another day to find this wonderful animal. I found all he said about the dog was true, but he had been the property of Proff<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Macgill and the gentleman is dead<ref target="#foot.f8"/> and the dog is away   And now the Minister keeps teazing me about my novel hunt never failing to ask every time I meet him “Well have you caught the howling dog yet”   He has told several of the gentlemen in the neighbourhood too, who say “Oh by the way I have heard of a wonderful dog who howls, but he’s in Sky.”<ref target="#foot.f9"/> or some eaqually far away place. However though it has been a great amusement to <hi rend="underline">them</hi>, it has been very useful to me for the stories I have heard about dogs, is something extraordinary throwing <hi rend="underline">my</hi> poor dog quite into the shade, and I shall be able to tell my friends in Edinburgh who doubt my story. We have both been ill with severe coughs but are getting better now   the season is very trying and it does not appear to be getting any better either.</p>
<p>With my kind regards to Mr Darwin and many thanks once more | I remain | Yours <hi rend="underline">very</hi> truly | A J Cupples. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
<p>Please remember me to your daughter I have a feeling she is married now, so I cannot say Miss Darwin<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
