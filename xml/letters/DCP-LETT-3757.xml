<p>There is an article in Bull. Bot. Soc. France VIII. 519 by A. de Lassus on irritability of leaves of Aldrovanda a kinsman of Drosera.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Thanks for your long letter on Linum &amp;c &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I sent you last Thursday a box with two good species of Impatiens flowers, &amp; can send a third if you care for it. I shall be most curious to know what you make of the Floral whorls &amp; their vasc. bundles<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Cassia</hi> is another genus that has different anthers in same flower. I have also thought of some Comelyneæ but am not sure.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Oliver<ref target="#foot.f6"/> has brought in a Tray of Drosera rotundifolia, but I doubt either of us having time to look at it.</p>
<p>My wife went to Cambridge &amp; enjoyed it— I stayed at home! (&amp; enjoyed it) working away at Welwitschia every day &amp; almost every night—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I entirely agree with you by the way, that after long working at a subject, &amp; after making something out of it, one invariably finds that it all seems dull flat stale and unprofitable—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> this feeling however you will observe only comes (most mercifully) after you <hi rend="underline">really</hi> have made out something worth knowing— I feel as if every body must know more of <hi rend="underline">Welwitchia</hi> than I do, &amp; yet I cannot but believe I have (ill or well) expounded &amp; faithfully recorded a heap of the most curious facts regarding a simple plant that have been brought to light for many years.</p>
<p>The whole thing is however a dry record of singular structures, &amp; sinks down to the level of the dullest descriptive account of dead matter, beside your jolly dancing facts anent orchid life &amp; bee-life. I have looked at an Orchid or two since reading the Orchid book &amp; feel that I never should have made out one of your points, even had I limitless leisure zeal &amp; material— I am a dull dog, a very dull dog.— I may content myself with the per contra reflection that you could not (be dull enough to) write a “Genera plantarum”, which is just about what I am best fitted for.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I feel I have a call that way, &amp; you the other.</p>
<p>The dismal fact you quote of hybrid transitions between <hi rend="underline">Verb</hi>. <hi rend="underline">Thapsus</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">nigra</hi> (or whichever two it was) &amp; its bearing on my practice of lumping species through intermediate specimens, is a very horrible one; &amp; would open my eyes to my own blindness if nothing else could.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I have long been prepared for such a case, though I once wrote much against its probability—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I feel tolerably sure I must have encountered many such, but have not the tact to discern them, when under my nose: &amp; I hence feel as if all my vast experience in the field has been thrown away. Your Orchid book has pretty well convinced me that such cases must be abundant,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; they only tend further to disturb our ideas of physiological versus structural species.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Perhaps my intermediates between <hi rend="underline">Habenaria chlorantha</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">bifolia</hi> (of which I retain a lively recollection) were of this hybrid nature.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Certain it is that I had only to look for Hybrid orchids at the in Switzerland to find <hi rend="underline">two</hi> different sorts. &amp; numerous specimens of one of them.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>Huxley seems to have made short work of Owen at Cambridge.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> the latter H. says “trailed his coat”—!<ref target="#foot.f17"/> Otherwise the meeting seems to me to have been dull enough, but cheery &amp; friendly as far as sociability goes</p>
<p>Ever Yours affec | J D Hooker</p>
<p>I don’t think it can be worth while returning the Melastomas but will enquire.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>

In a section of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3763.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D. Hooker 1853</ref>, which is headed ‘Species vary in a state of nature more than is usually supposed’ (pp. xii–xvii), Hooker stated: <quote type="quote"> The result of my observations is, that differences of habit, colour, hairiness, and outline of leaves, and minute characters drawn from other organs than those of reproduction, are generally fallacious as specific marks, as being attributable to external causes, and easily obliterated under cultivation. It has hence been my plan to group the individuals of a genus which I assume after careful examination to contain many species whose limits I cannot define, that the species shall have the same relative value as those have of allied genera whose specific characters are evident … with all, the tendency would be to regard dubious species as varieties, to take enlarged views of the range and variation of species, and to weigh characters not only <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, but with reference to those which prevail in the Order to which the species under consideration belong. </quote> Hooker employed this principle in his systematic work, and was inclined to combine in one species individuals previously considered to represent distinct species (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 5, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1685.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Asa Gray, 22 May 1855</ref> and n.6).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3763.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hooker 1853</ref>, p. xv, Hooker stated: <quote type="quote"> Hybridization has been supposed by many to be an important element in confusing and masking species. Nature, however, seems effectually to have guarded against its extensive operation and its effects in a natural state, and as a general rule the genera most easily hybridized in gardens, are not those in which the species present the greatest difficulties. With regard to the facility with which hybrids are produced, the prevalent ideas on the subject are extremely erroneous. </quote></note>
