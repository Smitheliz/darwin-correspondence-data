<p rend="right">Royal Botanic Gardens | Calcutta <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/>22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> January 1866</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Dr. Anderson who, I regret to say, has been suffering much of late from attacks of inflammation in the liver with fever, desired me previous to his leaving for Moulmein—where he has been advised to go for a few weeks—to advise you of the despatch of a dry box of plants containing the enclosed enumeration.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Coelogyne Hookeriana we had sent us only a few weeks ago from Sikkim, and have only retained a few pseudo-bulbs for trial here, as I think there are small hopes of us succeeding in keeping them through our hot season.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Even <hi rend="doubleUnderline">now </hi> they are impatient to the heat,—a good omen to the cool culturist at home—showing an inaptitude to climate, by a premature disposition to flower and the withering and dropping of these without opening.</p>
<p>I have sent you a few of the Bengal terrestrial orchids<ref target="#foot.f11"/>—all my <hi rend="underline">present</hi> <hi rend="underline">stock</hi> in <hi rend="italic">[</hi><hi rend="underline">pots</hi><hi rend="italic">]</hi>—having only lately commenced collecting these with a view to the establishment of an indigenous and exotic herbaceous garden, which Dr. Anderson has long wished to have… In one of the small tins enclosed are seeds of two species of Calami—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> those in the upper portion are C. Jenkinsianus Griff. collected this season by Dr. Anderson in the Terai—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> in the lower portion you have seeds from an unnamed species in our gardens. It seems to approach very closely to, if not identical with C. Lewisianus Griff.—a truly magnificent species though perhaps requiring a little more room than you can well spare. I have already succeeded in raising plants from the same produce as seeds sent you, and am much interested with them under the impression that they are in all probability <hi rend="doubleUnderline">hybrids</hi>—the seeds being produced in a plant with which a <hi rend="underline">male</hi> <hi rend="underline">plant</hi> of another noble and distinct species, C. angustifolius Griff., is entangled and both of which flowered at the same time,—and likewise at some distance from any others.</p>
<p>I have sent you three young plants of <hi rend="underline">Nipa</hi>, along with the ungerminated seed. I wished to have sent you more in the latter state, but as I had only your list of desiderata on the day of packing, there was little time to search for them, and my collectors said that they could find no others ungerminated. I with some hesitation enclosed you three of the youngest in slightly <hi rend="underline">moistened</hi> <hi rend="underline">charcoal</hi>, trusting that they are sufficiently secured to prevent communicating damp to the other contents. It will be well therefore to get the box secured as early as possible after the arrival of the mail in case of injury by frost.</p>
<p>I would now only express my sincere thanks for the very excellent appointment which through your recommendation has been made me,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> and should further feel obliged by your remembering me at your convenience, to my esteemed benefactor, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin, whom—from the press of incumbent duties, and a consequent want of time to pursue those experimental enquiries in which he takes such a lively interest, I have not lately had the pleasure of communicating with.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>I remain | Sir | Yours respectfully | J Scott</p>

CD wrote to Hooker on the Wednesday of that week confirming that he had sent Hooker’s letter of 21 February on to Lyell (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5020.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, [28 February 1866]</ref>).

CD gave Scott £25 on 10 June 1864 and £10 on 31 July 1864 (CD’s Classed account books (Down House MS)). CD entered the amounts under ‘Gifts [and] Annual Subscriptions.’ In August 1864, CD gave Scott a further £80 (CD’s Account books–cash account (Down House MS)).</note>
