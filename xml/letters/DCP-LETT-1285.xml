<p>I write merely to thank you very sincerely for your <hi rend="underline">great</hi> kindness in taking the trouble to inform me about your son. I was very anxious to hear something about his safety.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Your account is far better than I had ventured to anticipate; I feared that his collection would have gone to rack &amp; ruin— If nothing worse comes of it, it will be in after years a striking episode in his Himmalaya wanderings. How anxious Lady Hooker &amp; yourself must be to see him back, &amp; I am sure that he has very very many friends who cordially unite in this feeling.</p>
<p>With my best thanks | Pray believe me | Yours sincerely obliged | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Some time since Henslow forwarded to you a Geological letter from your son to me; no doubt you will keep it securely, which I mention because your son asked me to keep all his letters.—</p>
<p>I trust Miss Hooker is well— pray remember me very kindly to her.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Hooker and his travelling companion, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_799.xml">Archibald Campbell</ref>, political agent to Sikkim, had been made captives on 7 November 1849 by a Sikkim band under instructions from the Sikkim Dewan, who bore a grudge against Campbell. On 12 November, Hooker wrote a letter to his family reporting that, though kept under detention, he was not in danger. Both hostages were released on 23 December 1849 as a result of a threat of force by the British Government. The incident led to the annexation of southern Sikkim by the British. See J. D. Hooker 1854, 2: 203–41, and L. Huxley ed. 1918, 1: 313–19.</note>
