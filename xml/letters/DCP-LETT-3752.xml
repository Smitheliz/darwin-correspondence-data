<p>I have just been reading Max Müllers Lectures on the Science of Language, with much interest.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But perhaps what has interested me most is, after all, his perfect appreciation and happy use of Natural Selection, and the very complete <hi rend="underline">analogy</hi> between diversification of species and diversification of language.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I can hardly think of any publication which in England could be more useful to your cause than this volume is, or should be. I see also with what <hi rend="underline">great effect</hi> you may use it in our occasional discussion about <hi rend="underline">design</hi>,—indeed I hardly see how to avoid conclusion adverse to <hi rend="underline">special design</hi>.—tho’ I think I see indications of a way out.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Depend on it, Max Müller will be of real service to you.</p>

<p>I have been so much occupied that I deferred to the last moment to write out my 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> notice of your Orchid Book for Silliman’s Journal. I wrote out Saturday evening what I could, and to-day have finished and sent of my MSS. to New Haven.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The greater part consists of a record of some of my observations last summer.—very hurriedly penned, &amp; sent off. I trust you will be pleased, and will think that my little contributions cannot be better hatched than under your wings.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Hoping that my young correspondent is fast recovering strength, tell him that I have no more stamps for him yet, but shall pick up his desiderata one of these days.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5320.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Max Müller 1861</ref>. In his lectures, originally delivered at the Royal Institution in the summer of 1861, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3233.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Friedrich Max Müller</ref> sought to establish the study of language as a science operating according to the same epistemology as the natural sciences (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7486.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Stocking 1987</ref>, pp. 56–62).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In his final lecture, on the ‘theoretical stage’ of the science of language, and on the ‘origin of language’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5320.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Max Müller 1861</ref>, pp. 329–78), Max Müller argued that human language originated in the instinctive faculty of giving ‘articulate expression to the rational conceptions’ of the mind (p. 370). Although he considered that the nature of these first ‘<hi rend="italic">phonetic types</hi>’ was entirely determined by natural instincts, the ‘almost infinite’ number of them was, he claimed, subsequently reduced by a ‘process of elimination, or natural selection’, so that ‘clusters of roots, more or less synonymous, were gradually reduced to one definite type.’ The combining of the fundamental roots into different languages was, he claimed, ‘the work of man, not in his individual and free, but in his collective and moderating capacity’ (pp. 374–5). He concluded (p. 377): <quote type="quote"> The first natural and instinctive utterances, if sifted differently by different clans, would fully account both for the first origin and for the first divergence of human speech. We can understand not only the origin of language, but likewise the necessary breaking up of one language into many; and we perceive that no amount of variety in the material or the formal elements of speech is incompatible with the admission of one common source. </quote> On Max Müller’s views on evolution, see, for instance, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6980.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Schrempp 1983</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4408.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Knoll 1986</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Gray probably refers to Max Müller’s use of natural selection as an analogy for the development of language. Denying that ‘the various forms of development in language must be explained … as <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> evolutions, founded in the essence of human speech’, Max Müller argued that, after its first origin, the evolution of language was entirely a matter of historical contingency (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5320.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Max Müller 1861</ref>, pp. 373–4). This suggestion could be seen as undermining Gray’s view, first given in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3018.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[A. Gray] 1860</ref>, that the variations on which natural selection operated were specially designed. See also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4112.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Asa Gray, 20 April 1863</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4148.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, [9 May 1863]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4153.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 11 May [1863]</ref>. Gray and CD had discussed intermittently since 1860 the question of design in nature (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vols. 8 and 9).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Having published a review of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref> in the June number of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Science and Arts</hi> (A. Gray 1862a), Gray had planned to write a follow-up article (A. Gray 1862b). The <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Science and Arts</hi>, founded by Benjamin Silliman, was commonly known as ‘Silliman’s journal’; it was published in New Haven, Connecticut.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In the summer of 1862, Gray had made numerous observations of the mechanisms for effecting pollination in several American species of orchid. CD had initially suggested that Gray might publish some of his observations with his review of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, but subsequently sought to persuade him to publish them separately (see letters to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3595.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">10–20 June [1862]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3634.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">1 July [1862]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3662.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">23[–4] July [1862]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3667.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">28 July [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3710.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[3–]4 September [1862]</ref>).</note>
