<p>I am induced to trouble you with this note under the belief that you must be glad to receive a communication even from a stranger of any curious incident in Natural History, especially when bearing upon such subjects as are treated of in your works— I have just been informed by a superannuated gamekeeper on the estate of a very great noble, that in one of his rambles he started a hare just as she was in the act of dropping a leveret. Upon coming up to her nest, he found there another leveret, which had also been very recently born (perhaps about 5 minutes before his arrival)— Leverets, he told me, are born with their eyes open.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> And he assured me that he saw the elder of the abovementioned pair begin at once to lick the younger as if it had been its offspring, &amp; go through the task so completely that, before concluding, the younger one was as clean as the elder.</p>
<p>He was evidently not aware of its being customary for leverets to perform such a work for their younger brothers &amp; sisters. But unless such a custom exists, &amp; is transmitted in the character of hereditary leveret work (if I may so express myself) the case seems inevitably to be one of transmission to young of a practice preexisting in parents only— My informant did not state whether he had observed the sex of the precocious matron—but, if that be important, I can enquire about it—</p>
<p>May I ask (as an additional venture) whether your attention has been directed to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richardson’s recent communications to “Nature” upon Vivisection—especially to a passage in the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>. column of p 340 of <hi rend="underline">vol 14 now in</hi> course of publication. It there appears that rabbits, through breathing air charged with the vapour of nitrite of amyl were cured of a species of lepra—the increased capillary circulation causing <hi rend="underline">the scales to fall off</hi> &amp; healthy skin to appear, upon which <hi rend="underline">fur</hi> began to grow—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I feel my presumption, but I cannot help submitting to your consideration the question whether some great change in the terrestrial atmosphere in past ages,—or the closing up in reptiles of the 2 auricles of the heart—may not have been the cause of a change of covering, from scales to fur or feathers in their descendants— If the idea I have presented is nonsensical,:—or already familiar in some shape or other—I trust you will excuse it—&amp; pray excuse also my adding how grateful I feel for the enormous pleasure which (although an unscientific person) I have derived from the perusal of your wonderful books—</p>
