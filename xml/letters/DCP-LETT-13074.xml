<p>If all the sea &amp; fresh water fishes together had tumbled on to my head I could not have been more astonished than I was by your letter &amp; its inclosures or rather by the inclosures for I am never astonished by any amount of kindness in your letters—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Do you recollect that I jokingly told you long ago after I had been to see Rich that I had half a mind to try &amp; cut you out?<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Upon my life I feel almost as if I had defrauded you, in spite of the innocence of my heart and if it had been decent I should like to have requested to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich that he had better let the house go along with the rest to you &amp; yours.</p>
<p>Don’t you covet it, like Naboth’s vineyard?—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You will be forgetting that I am a man of peace now, &amp; be for putting me “in the forefront of the battle”.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have written to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Rich and asked him to let my wife &amp; me pay him a visit sometime this spring—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Wife is immensely pleased—and bless her, has no doubt that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich is the one of the few men of discernment now living— It is really wonderfully kind &amp; thoughtful of him—but he is a tough old gentleman &amp; has a good chance of outlasting his legatee—who grieves to confess the fact that he is unmistakably growing older</p>
<p>I sometimes think I must have a row with somebody just to see if there is any of the old stuff left!</p>
<p>With all our loves | Ever Yours | T H Huxley</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13073.xml">letter to T. H.

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Huxley alludes to the biblical story in which Naboth refused to sell his vineyard to King Ahab (1 Kings 21).</note>
