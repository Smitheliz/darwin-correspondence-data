<p>Your sympathy is very warm to make you wish to hear all about us. Litchfield’s illness has been a very serious one, namely inflammation of the cæcum; but he is now able to sit up for a short time every day.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Leonard’s knee has been a bad job &amp; it would have been better if it had been broken.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But he now goes on one crutch instead of two. On the favourable side of the balance, Williams marriage has pleased us greatly, for we considered him an inveterate bachelor. He was married two days ago to a charming american.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> As for myself I am better than usual &amp; am working away very hard on the physiology of plants.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>We had a grand time of it in Cambridge &amp; I saw my old rooms in Christ’s where we spent so many happy days.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I saw see that you ask two other questions: Caroline is better in general health &amp; comes down stairs every day but I fear will never leave Leith Hill Place.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Secondly George has seen no reason to change his conclusions about the marriage of cousins. He is very hard at work in Cambridge on Astronomical problems, which are so deep I cannot understand what they are about.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Farewell my dear old friend | Yours affectionately | Charles Darwin</p>
