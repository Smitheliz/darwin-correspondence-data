<p>I will not fail to speak what I think about your high merits if consulted by any of the Senate.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I should be very glad of any criticisms on the origin— I imagine you have not finished it. I suspect that we are at cross purposes about “typical” &amp; “specialisation”— I look at the latter (ie. specialisation of organs) with all physiologists as a great advantage to each being &amp; therefore as <hi rend="underline">not</hi> likely to lead to their extinction.—   And with respect to Typical—I observe that Naturalists use it in two very different senses; hence I have almost entirely or entirely avoided its use—</p>
<p>You will see something about the preservation of old former forms in islands &amp; in isolated situations—a subject on which I could have much enlarged.—   I doubt whether you understand my notions on extinction; but when we meet you can explain what you mean by “Specialisation” &amp; “typical”.</p>
<p>The fair way to view the argument of my book, I think, is to look at Natural Selection as a mere hypothesis (though rendered in some degree probable by the analogy of method of production of domestic races; &amp; by what we know of the struggle for existence) &amp; then to judge whether the mere hypothesis explains a large body of facts in Geographical Distribution, Geological Succession, &amp; more especially in Classification, Homology, Embryology, Rudimentary Organs    The hypothesis to me does seem to explain several independent large classes of facts; &amp; this being so, I view the hypothesis as a theory having a high degree of probability of truth. All turns on whether the above classes of facts seem to you satisfactorily explained or not.— The difficulties are great; but they concern the “imperfection of the Geological record,” “means of distribution” &amp; “possibility of transitions of organs”    And on these classes of facts we are confessedly ignorant, &amp; we do not know how ignorant.— I simply believe that we are <hi rend="doubleUnderline">far</hi> more ignorant than any one supposed—</p>
<p>Forgive me for troubling you with this harangue, for I should very much like to <hi rend="underline">stagger</hi> you,—to <hi rend="underline">pervert</hi> you or any good man ought &amp; must require months of self reflection.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | C Darwin.</p>
<p>It may be a vain &amp; silly thing to say, but I believe my Book must be read twice carefully to be fully understood.— You will perhaps think it by no means worth the labour.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Woodward may have been a candidate for one of the two examinerships in geology and palaeontology vacant in the University of London. The election by the Senate was to be held on 25 April 1860 (<hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi>, 10 March 1860, p. 321). Woodward’s obituary notices allude to the fact that he was, at some unspecified time, appointed examiner in geology and palaeontology for the University of London.</note>
