<p>Your letter has given me much pleasure,—more than you would anticipate, &amp; more perhaps than it ought to do,—though I put down part of what you say to the kindness of disposition, which I have observed in your memoirs &amp; in your letters to me. I have had a short letter from Müller of Berlin, expressing interest in my Book, and now, with what you have said, I feel highly satisfied, &amp; can go on with my work with a good heart:<ref target="#foot.f1"/> You will perhaps be surprised at all this; but I think everyone wants sympathy in their pursuits, &amp; I live a very retired life in the country, &amp; for months together see no one out of my own large family.</p>
<p>With respect to what you say on the homologies of the larva in the first stage, I confess to have gone through more doubt than on any other part: for some time I thought the three pairs of legs corresponded with the mandibles, the inner &amp; outer maxillæ, for I must still believe in there being (potentially) <hi rend="underline">two pairs</hi> of antennæ in the earliest stage; but the description of the larva in the <hi rend="underline">second</hi> stage by Burmeister (whose paper by the way is <hi rend="underline">dreadfully</hi> incorrect)<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; the somewhat varying position of the mouth in the first stage, led me to the view which I have taken.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I hope that, whenever you have an opportunity that you will attend to the adhesion of the Lerneidæ:—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> the method of attachment, which I have described is certainly the great character of the class of Cirripedia.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I thank you much for your wish for me to have the Cirripedia of the Expedition, but I know well how impossible it is.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Your information on the Corals has been most useful; for in the two cases in which you speak most positively, are the very two, to which I have not the smallest clue for habitat.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I am most vexed at the wooden-pill Box with the Crustacean having been lost: I put it in the parcel myself:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I suppose the parcel must have been opened at your Custom House &amp; so the little Box lost: I have got Bailliere<ref target="#foot.f9"/> to write to New York to enquire: I had hoped this would have turned out of some interest to you.—</p>
<p>I have lately been reading the vols. for the last dozen years of Silliman’s Journal,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> with great interest: What a curious account is that on the blind Fauna by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Silliman, of the caves.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I feel extreme interest on the subject, having for many years collected facts on variation, &amp;c &amp;c.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Would it be possible to procure one of the Rats for the British Museum? I should so like my friend M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Waterhouse to examine the teeth &amp; see whether it is an old or new world form.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> If ever you could oblige the naturalists on this side of the water by getting so interesting a specimen, would you send it to me to give to Waterhouse; for (<hi rend="doubleUnderline">privately between ourselves</hi>) it would be of little use to real science, if once in the hands of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gray;<ref target="#foot.f14"/> —but very likely I am asking for an impossibility; the rats may be very rare. It is not stated whether the optic nerve was dissected out, which would be a curious point.—</p>
<p>I read over again in the Journal several of your papers; if I had space I should have liked to have fought a friendly battle with you on the Australian valleys; I see I have not stated my side versus fresh water in nearly enough detail.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>Did you not observe the great high plain forming peninsulas running laterally into the valleys, (&amp; I suspect almost truly insulated masses); and these seem to me to be very improbable on the running water theory. Again, as far as I saw, 
    
    <figure rend="blockCentred width65">
        <graphic url="../images/dcp_lett_1481.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    
&amp; as appears on maps, the line of drainage never seems to lie at foot of precipices on either side; &amp; it appears to me that this might be expected to occur <hi rend="underline">here &amp;</hi> <hi rend="underline">there</hi>, if the valleys were still in process of excavation.— but I had no intention to discuss this subject when I began, or to trouble you with so very long a letter.</p>
<p>Accept my thanks for your very kind letter, &amp; believe me | Very sincerely your’s Charles Darwin.—</p>

See also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851): </ref>9–13, where CD discussed his views on the homologies of the two larval antennae, the mouth, and the legs. He held that the eyes, prehensile antennae, and therefore the peduncle were homologous with the first three (cephalic) segments of Crustacea (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 25). Concerning the homologies of the larval legs, see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1542.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Dana, 6 December [1853]</ref>, n. 2.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The Lerneidae, an order of parasitic copepods, share several characteristics with the Cirripedia. Like cirripedes, they hatch as a free-swimming nauplius and at the first cyclops stage they settle as parasites on the gills of a flat-fish; later they are transformed again into free-swimming sexual forms. The means by which the larvae, and later the female, attach to the host was obscure in the 1850s, as were their precise taxonomic affinities. See Baird 1851, pp. 307–22 for a contemporary historical account of the systematic arrangement of this group.

CD’s belief that the cement gland was a modified ovarian tube led him to misunderstand the structure of the ovaries, the routes of the oviducts, and the function of an organ he identified as an acoustic sac (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1639.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Crisp 1983</ref>). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2761.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">August David Krohn</ref> later correctly recognised that CD’s ovarian glands were salivary glands and traced the oviducts to their true openings, CD’s so-called auditory sacs (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4503.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Krohn 1859</ref> and CD’s <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_244.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘On the so-called “auditory-sac” of cirripedes’</ref>, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 85–7).</note>
