<p>I thank you sincerely for your most friendly letter.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I shall have to send at end of week to Athenæum<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; will there get the volume of Poems, which M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Herbert &amp; you have so kindly sent us, &amp; which I have no doubt we shall like much.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> My wife desires to be most kindly remembered to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Herbert, &amp; she has often regretted that we have been so completely separated. Some few months ago I was looking over a few old &amp; valued letters which I keep, &amp; amongst others there were some of yours &amp; which were so pleasant that they quite warmed my old heart.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I began a letter to you on the strength of old remembrances, but as I was interrupted I afterwards destroyed it, having nothing particular to say, except what I am sure you will believe, that I shall keep to my dying day as unfading remembrance of the many pleasant hours (especially at Barmouth) which we have spent together.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>My health will, I fear, never be fully reestablished, &amp; though anyone would think me a strong man, this is very far from the case; &amp; hence I never go from home, so that I much fear there is little chance of our being able to visit you at Rocklands,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> though I am very Sure it would give us much pleasure.— If ever you have time to spare when in London it would give us real pleasure, if you could pay us a visit here.—</p>
<p>With our united very kind remembrances to you both, My dear Herbert | Your old &amp; affect<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>. friend | Charles Darwin</p>
