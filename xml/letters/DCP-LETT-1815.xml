            <p>Thanks WDF for his help and reports on progress in "the Cock and Hen line of business". Has written to every quarter of the world for skins of poultry and pigeons.</p>
            <p>As for seeds, Hooker and Bentham obstinately refuse to believe they can live even a few years in the ground.</p>

<p>Thanks for your letter: I had your name on my list to write to soon to tell you how I got on in the Cock &amp; Hen line of business. I have got nothing but promises as yet, &amp; there are few or none like you, who do what they promise, though I fully believe they intend at the moment to do so.</p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very glad of old &amp; good Cochin, Dorking &amp; Malay Call Drake;<ref target="#foot.f1"/> though I think it possible that I may get Cochin elsewhere; if I succeed I will instantly write to you.— Indeed almost any cock w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be very valuable to me, if of good breed; but I do not want to be unreasonable, after the immense trouble you took for me in regard to Chickens.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have as yet not tried energetically for Poultry, but I have for dead Pigeons, &amp; my success has been not great, so that I do not want throw away any chance of good Bird from any quarter.</p>
<p>I offer payment for dead Pigeons, &amp; Ducks &amp; Rabbits to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Baker.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Young Baily, from whom I have bought live Pigeons, I found not at all obliging about dead birds.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> If I fail by other channels, I will apply to the Father Baily &amp; use Pulleine’s name,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> or get him to write a note to him.— I have since I wrote last greatly extended my scheme; &amp; I have now written above 20 letters to every great quarter of the world to professional skinners, &amp; others to get me collection of Poultry &amp; Pigeons skins;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> if I succeed I think it will be a very curious collection.—</p>
<p>With respect to the Athenæum I have f<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. it so dull that I have for some time left off taking it in;—I quite forgot to mention this to you.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>With respect to seeds, my few remarks were made, on account of Hookers, extreme obstinacy, (as it appears to me) in not believing that seeds can live even a few years in the ground.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Your Isle of Wight case w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have been interesting if written at the time with certainty about the species; but without every particular given Hooker &amp; Bentham, sneer at every account.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I am particularly obliged by the particulars on the eggs &amp; colour of the Muscovy Ducks &amp; sheep: all such facts are <hi rend="underline">valuable</hi> to me.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I have heard something analogous about crossing Cochin Chinas.— Did you ever see the Poultry Chronicle; one of the best contributor B. P. Brent, lives not far off, &amp; is very kind in giving me information: unfortunately he has given up keeping many Birds.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Farewell, we are not in a very flourishing condition; as many of us are rather poorly, &amp; my wife for a couple of months has been suffering much from headachs.— I congratulate &amp; condole with you on your 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> child:<ref target="#foot.f12"/> in my own case, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have wished only for condolence.</p>
<p>Yours very affectionately | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | Would you blow for me an <hi rend="underline">average</hi> egg of the White &amp; Slate-coloured or other var. of Musk Duck.— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. very much like to have these.</p>
