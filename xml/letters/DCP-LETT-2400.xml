<p>I have got the little Book for you, but I have only this minute discovered (for the seal tore by an odd chance the exact spot) that you asked me to get two copies.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But I really think it would be superfluous. You may rely on it that the man is an advertising Humbug. I know plenty of people, &amp; have one relation very deaf, &amp; everyone in London would know about this man’s powers of curing if true. You may depend on it, that besides syringing in <hi rend="underline">certain</hi> cases there is little or nothing to be done.—</p>
<p>My Father who was a very wise man, said he had known numbers who had been much injured by Aurists &amp; none who had been benefitted. A common good surgeon can do all that these humbugs can do.— I am very sorry to hear about your deafness increasing: it is a very great misfortune for you, but I fear you must look at it as incurable.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am glad to hear that you are doing pretty well; &amp; if you can settle your sons in an agricultural line, they will have no cause to complain, for no life can be more healthy or happy.</p>
<p>We have had an unhappy summer: my eldest girl having been very ill with Diptheria, a new &amp; very fatal throat complaint,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; my youngest Baby Boy having died at the same time of Scarlet fever.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> My second daughter is also very delicate.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> After our misery we went to Isle of Wight for six weeks for a change.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>My health keeps very poor &amp; I never know 24 hours comfort. I force myself to try &amp; bear this as incurable misfortune. We all have our unhappinesses, only some are worse than others. And you have a heavy one in your deafness.—</p>
<p>With every good wish for the prosperity of your self &amp; family, believe me | Dear Covington | Yours very sincerely |</p>
<p>Ch. Darwin<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
