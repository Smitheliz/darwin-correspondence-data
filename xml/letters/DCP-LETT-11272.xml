            <p>Sends a drawing [missing] of alleged fossil man found in Colorado. JM is certain it is a hoax perpetrated by P. T. Barnum. It was designed to conform to CD’s well-known views of man’s ancestor.</p>

<p>You are not likely to remember that in 1870 I sent you sketches of “Pollen” showing distortion of form— I then resided in Barnes England.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have since persumd my Microscopical studies, and during the last six years in this Country.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I now forward by this Mail a very correct drawing of the supposed Fossil Man of prehistoric date, found in Colorado—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You will notice all the soft parts (including the penis not shown in drawing) are fossilized— I may mention that the figure has a tail.—</p>
<p>It is not easy to perceive how any person of ordinary intelligence could be deceived, for a mere glance was sufficient for me to detect the imposture— but I believe so many laws of nature are set aside in this matter, that it is not necessary to view the figure to settle the question— I regret to say that many Physicians and men of that class are in doubt, and I fear much harm to Science will follow, as the ignorant will make it a handle, if the thing is not put down—</p>
<p>I understand the thing was found near a place owned by Barnum in Colorado—and <hi rend="underline">he</hi> is handling it here, although others are are put forward.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have no doubt that the subject will reach England, and I thought a drawing of the figure would be useful to you, the sketch was made for an advertisement but I have compared it and find it fairly correct, except the feet, the toes of which are too pointed, and divided— You will of course notice the attempt to carve a figure, to conform with your well known views—A man 7<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> feet high with, tail, and hand like feet, and arms of extreme length—</p>
<p>I trust the drawing will be useful in the sense I have indicated, to check imposture, if I can be useful at any time, on this side, please make use of me—</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully | John Michels.—</p>
