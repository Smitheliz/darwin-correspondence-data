                    <salute>Sir,</salute>

<p>I send off by train to-night a small box with three plants of P. Scotica and three of P. farinosa.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am sorry that I cannot get any more for you at present, but if I can possibly do so in the course of the ensuing spring; you may depend upon receiving them! On one of the plants of P. Scotica, you will observe a few capsules. Perhaps they may not contain many perfect seeds being the produce of late autumn flowers, in cold, damp weather. 〈You〉 will, however, see by these withered and attached 〈f〉lowers 〈    〉 dimorphic condition.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have not had an 〈<hi rend="underline">two lines destroyed</hi>〉 seen an approach to the dimorphic 〈    〉. I have 〈not had〉 〈an opp〉ortunity of examining it!</p>
<p>I also send in the box with 〈    〉 flowers of the <hi rend="underline">Gongora atropurpurea</hi>, which I think 〈will〉 interest you, unless you have already examined it. I believe your remarks on <hi rend="underline">Acropera luteola</hi> are equally applicable to it〈.〉 I find the <hi rend="underline">genitalia</hi> of <hi rend="underline">Gongora atropurpurea</hi> very similar to those of <hi rend="underline">A.</hi> <hi rend="underline">luteola</hi> according to your description.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But all my attempts to fertilise <hi rend="underline">it</hi> have as <hi rend="underline">yet</hi> been unsuccessful. I have never succeeded in inserting a pollen-mass into the stigmatic cavity. It is decidedly more contracted than the majority of those I have examined of <hi rend="underline">A. Loddigesii.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f4"/> In the latter there are usually a few flowers sufficiently open to permit a partial insertion of a pollen-mass; and so it appears to be with <hi rend="underline">A. luteola</hi> though in a still less degree; as I observe you had to allow them to shrink a little, and even then rarely succeeded.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I am now applying viscous matter from other <hi rend="underline">orchids</hi> to stigmatic cavity of <hi rend="underline">G.</hi> <hi rend="underline">atropurpurea</hi>, and thus attaching its pollen-mass, in the hope of thus effecting its fertilisation. This will also aid in preventing the desiccation of the pollen-masses, which takes place ve〈ry r〉apidly in the hot, dry atmosphere where the plant is;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> and thus favours the independent production and protrusion of the pollen-tubes. I may be wrong in entertaining this hope, yet from the success attending the experiments on <hi rend="underline">Acropera</hi>, in one of which the <hi rend="underline">pollen mass</hi>, scarcely—if at all—penetrated stigmatic cavity,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am anxious to to give it a fair test. This opinion, is furthermore supported by the following experiment which seems to show 〈that〉 the <hi rend="underline">pollen tubes</hi> may penetrate the column independent of the <hi rend="underline">stigmatic</hi> 〈    〉. Having lately observed Dr Hooker’s experiments on the fertilisation 〈of〉 Meconopsis after the stigma had been cut off,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I 〈<hi rend="underline">three words destroyed</hi>〉</p>
<p>Amongst 〈others〉 I have tried 〈<hi rend="underline">three words destroyed</hi>〉 Max〈illaria〉 〈  〉stii; with the latter I have 〈<hi rend="underline">three words destroyed</hi>〉 of the former, at present gives fair indications, 〈    〉 〈I〉 believe some of my experiments at your suggestion 〈    〉 then by applying <hi rend="underline">pollen-mass</hi> to the <hi rend="underline">rostellum</hi>, now promise to be successful. This will be somewhat strange, in considering how much longer the period is before indications of its being effected are given by this mode in comparison with the normal.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
                    <p>I have been making various <hi rend="underline">random experiments</hi> of late on the <hi rend="underline">fertilisation</hi> of <hi rend="underline">distinct genera</hi>, for the purpose of elucidating in part, your view, “of sterility not being a special endowment’:<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Among many failures, I really believe I have succeeded in fertilising the <hi rend="underline">Stanhopea oculata</hi>, with <hi rend="underline">Lælia</hi> <hi rend="underline">anceps.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f11"/> I will state my grounds for this hope. There were <hi rend="underline">three flowers</hi> experiment〈ed〉 upon one self-impregnated, the other two with pollen from <hi rend="underline">Lælia</hi>. the other flowers on the raceme, I did not operate upon. Now in the latter as soon as the <hi rend="underline">perianth</hi> drooped, the <hi rend="underline">ovary</hi> and <hi rend="underline">labellum</hi> quickly followed, first exhibiting a general flaccidity, then becoming dry and shrivelled. Those impregnated, on the other hand, exhibited no such signs, but are still fresh. The <hi rend="underline">ovaries</hi>, are swelling, certainly very slowly. Nevertheless the <hi rend="underline">two hybrid products</hi>, are still equally as <hi rend="underline">large</hi> as the self-impregnated; and they were all experimented upon on the same day, viz; the <hi rend="underline">13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Dec</hi>. Whether they ever reach maturity or not, they are evidently affected by the pollen of <hi rend="underline">Lælia</hi>, otherwise they would have withered long ere this, as is invariably the case with the unfertilised ovaries of Stanhopea. Should they not reach maturity, I will if you wish transmit the ovaries for examination; otherwise—and I have much faith in its being so—I will try if I can possibly get the seeds to germinate; as they certainly would be most anomalous products. By the way, in talking of hybridisation, I will have the so-called <hi rend="underline">Bryanthus erectus</hi> in flower shortly, and I intend testing its capabilities for fertilisation. I am aware of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Anderson’s failures, but there is no harm in again attempting it.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I will also <hi rend="underline">re-cross</hi> its <hi rend="underline">parents</hi>, and see if I can succeed in raising anything from them. Perhaps I may thus out which was the <hi rend="underline">male</hi> and which the <hi rend="underline">female</hi>, of the <hi rend="underline">Bryanthus</hi>, as I suppose it is not known, and the raiser is now long dead.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I will be glad if you suggest to me any experiments on these points, that you think would be of interest.</p>
<p>The seed capsule of <hi rend="underline">Acropera</hi> is now pretty large—2<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> inches long, by 1<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> inches in circumference.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I am sorry that those for comparison should be so far behind it. I expected to have a few capsules of a <hi rend="underline">Maxillaria</hi> for comparison, but not one of them set; and so it was with the <hi rend="underline">Oncidium</hi> <hi rend="underline">ornithorynchum</hi>, although I impregnated many flowers of the latter, not a <hi rend="underline">single capsule</hi> set. I have now <hi rend="underline">succeeded</hi> in <hi rend="underline">fertilising</hi> the latter, however, by applying pollen from <hi rend="underline">Oncidium</hi> <hi rend="underline">sphacelatum</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I do not lay much <hi rend="underline">stress</hi> on this experiment <hi rend="underline">yet</hi>, as my former failures may be owing to uncongenial conditions; but, as further opportunities present themselves, I will carefully attend to them. This far, however, I may safely say, that we have at least an instance, of <hi rend="underline">equal</hi>—if not higher <hi rend="underline">susceptibility</hi> to <hi rend="underline">others</hi> than <hi rend="underline">own pollen</hi>. I am determined to devote in future a little more attention to the Orchids. I think curious results may be derived from them.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I am only sorry that I have not a better collection to experiment upon; for we are indeed poor, and not only in them, but in the majority of the <hi rend="underline">florists</hi> favourites. We are very differently situate here in this respect than Kew. Thus first to take the few things you have directed my attention to, I have only at present the Primulas.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> I am now, however, promised from a friend, plants of peloric <hi rend="underline">Antirrhinums</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Columbines</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f18"/> and likewise Verbascums—one species at least with its varieties, perhaps I may yet get others.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> Do you know anything of the two varieties of <hi rend="underline">Maize</hi>, Gartner experimented upon? If I asked you in my last this question about the <hi rend="underline">Verbascum</hi>, it was the <hi rend="underline">Maize</hi> I intended.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>Had I remembered the <hi rend="underline">Begonia frigida</hi>, I should have asked M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Nab,<ref target="#foot.f21"/> before he visited Kew last to have seen if they could have spared a plant for the garden here, but now it is too late for this season. I am sorry as it would be an interesting subject for experiment, and I really feel shy in my circumstances to ask M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Nab specially to see whether they could afford us a plant of it or not. And here I may take the opportunity of stating in reply to your kind enquiries into my personal circumstances,<ref target="#foot.f22"/> that in consequence of certain loses in business sustained by my parents, we were thus brought down from easy circumstances, to a comparatively humble position.<ref target="#foot.f23"/> My parents died while I was very young, leaving me in charge of a relative. After receiving an ordinary education, I became a gardener<ref target="#foot.f24"/>—more for the purpose of gratifying a predilection for Natural History—than any love for this line of life. But I thus thought that I might have better opportunities for pursuing these branches of Science, than by any other I had it in my power to engage in. And, so far, I am happy to say—I have not been disappointed, and I now through the kindness of Prof. Balfour,<ref target="#foot.f25"/> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Nab, enjoy great facilities for such pursuits. At present, I have the charge of the propagating department in the Botanic Gardens here, and I have thus excellent opportunities for performing experiments, having a sufficient range of temperature for all ordinary purposes. I may state that I was all but engaged a few months back by Prof. Balfour, to go to Madras, as Superintendent of the Horticultural Gardens there. I was ultimately disappointed of this situation, however, in consequence of the re-engagement of the then Superintendent.<ref target="#foot.f26"/> It is therefore hard to say what part of the world I may next be sent to, but time will show;<ref target="#foot.f27"/> And then, perhaps you will kindly favour me with a few suggestions hints, and advices, on observations that I may then have it in my power to make. And now by giving you excuse for this detailed account of personal affairs I will only ask you in conclusion to excuse my non-reference to one or two points in your last, which I will do at an early opportunity.</p>
<p>I remain | Sir, | Yours very respectfully | John Scott.</p>
<p>I am unfortunately perfectly ignorant of the <hi rend="underline">staminal</hi> conditions of our Melastomads.<ref target="#foot.f28"/> we have indeed very few of them in the Gardens here. But if the few that we have present any differences, I will attend to them when they again flower.</p>
<p>J. S.</p>
<p>The Primulas being all very weak it would not be advisable to plant them in the garden at present—they had better be kept in pots till spring. It is difficult to get strong plants of <hi rend="underline">Scotica</hi>, <hi rend="underline">especially</hi> it does not thrive long under cultivation.<ref target="#foot.f29"/> I am sorry that I had no stronger to send you at present. Such as they are you will please to accept in slight acknowledgement of your kindness to me.</p>
