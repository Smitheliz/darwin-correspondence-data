                    <p>Many thanks for your letter also for Nature &amp; the german paper—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am very glad the root results came out well. It was was idiotic of me not to keep notes of the negative cases.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I didn’t send a note to Nature about the Drosera because I thought it oughtn’t to appear before it did in the Linnean, I sent a note as an appendix about the Germans’ experiment, but I am not sure whether it will go in, tho’ why I cannot understand as I have had no proofs—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Murie says he will plan its insertion “some way” or other.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> He seems to think I am not going to alter my proofs much but I expect I shall. The Germans work is very satisfactory as confirming mine. I see my London Institution lecture is translated in that French revue Internationale.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>George has sent me a very interesting article by Stanley Jevons on Brownian movement<ref target="#foot.f7"/>   I think it may bear on water in wood.</p>
                    <p>I think I shall come back on Wednesday 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>—&amp; I must try &amp; get a day or two at Cambridge to try electricity with Dew Smith.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
                    <p>Your Southampton visit seems to have been very prosperous—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
                    <p>Bernard is extremely jolly &amp; very good friends with all but Baby who I believe takes a certain amount of pleasure in teasing him. He is quite enraptured every day at throwing stones in the stream. I don’t know what he’ll do at Down   I think he will have to have a little puddle made for him like the beavers. He had a heart breaking parting from Mary Anne this morning   she went to church in the waggonette &amp; I &amp; B drove as far as the gate to meet the postbag, &amp; when he found she was going on without him he was dreadfully grieved—but cheered up in 2 minutes over the thoughts of a little tame rabbit he wanted to see.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I had two nice letters from Mother &amp; Bessy<ref target="#foot.f11"/> which I ought to have answered—</p>
<p>Your affec son | Frank Darwin</p>
                    <p>I should be much obliged if you would pay £60 now instead of July 1 to my account.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I don’t think I shall want it, but I shall shave it rather close.</p>
                    <p>I send off Sachs today<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
