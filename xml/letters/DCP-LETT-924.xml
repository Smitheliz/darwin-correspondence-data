<p>I had intended not writing to you, until I had looked through your Botany,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> but I must at once thank you very much for it &amp; for your two letters. I began reading the first number last night, &amp; turned over the pages of some of the others, &amp; saw quite enough to show me how much there will be of the very highest interest to me. How different your remarks make it to most systematic works! but I will say no more about it now, except to thank you once again very heartily for it, though I know full well how unworthy I am as a naturalist for such a present, yet I am proud of it, not to mention its real practical use to me.</p>
<p>It was indeed most absurdly unjust to speak of you, as a mere systematist. You speak of your printed letter, as being “bilious”, I do assure you, as far as my judgment goes, I see no signs of such feelings.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You must forgive me for alluding to such a subject, but I must say I admire from the bottom of my heart, the manner in which you have borne your disappointment &amp; illiberal treatment. Your noble (&amp; really interesting) set of Testimonials must be a consolation when you think of the Baillie’s speeches.—</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you are hard at work again &amp; continue to find interesting geographical results: assuredly, as you say in your Preface, geographical distrib: will be the key which will unlock the mystery of species.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> By the way I have written to Capt. Beaufort some queries, &amp; amongst others urged him to direct attention to the Floras of <hi rend="underline">all</hi> <hi rend="underline">isolated</hi> islands.— I presume of course, you have specimens of the junction of the Beech-parasite, in spirits;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I gave some to Brown, who, I daresay, w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> give them up, if you want more specimens.—</p>
<p>Many thanks for l’Espece;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> could you lend me sometime, your former copy that I may transpose my marks (or rather exchange copies) as I do not want the trouble of looking it over again. I shall be glad to see the other pamphets; though I do not expect much, if they are by Gerard.— I am sorry to say I have sent my very small packet to Ehrenberg: I did not give you a fair chance &amp; ought to have retained it longer; but I am in a hurry for Ehrenberg’s answer.— I will return the Testimonials to you;—I shall not, however, send to the Geolog. Soc. for another week..— You ask about my health: I have been unusually well for a week past, owing, I believe, to what sounds a great piece of quackery, viz twice a day passing a galvanic stream through my insides from a small-plate battery for half an hour.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I think it certainly has relieved some of my distressing symptoms.— My wife is not as strong as she ought to be.</p>
<p>—If you want to read a zoological book, I think Waterhouse’s Mammalia (now publishing by Bailliere) w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. interest you;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I can lend it you at some future time, when several of the numbers are out.— I hope this next summer to finish my S. American geology;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> then to get out a little zoology<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; hurrah for my species-work, in which, according to every law of probability, I shall stick &amp; be confounded in the mud.—</p>
<p>I wish I could get you sometime hence to look over a rough sketch (well copied) on this subject,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> but it is too impudent a request.</p>
<p>Farewell my dear Hooker | Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
