        <abstract>
            <p>Clarifies his earlier query on Bell’s observations. Seeks confirmation of Bell’s statement that the conjunctiva of a child whose eyes are opened forcibly during a screaming fit become engorged with blood. CD has noted a relationship between contraction of the orbicular muscle and secretion of tears; can WB explain why they appear related?</p>

<p>I called at your house about 3 weeks since &amp; heard that you were away for the whole month, which I much regretted as I wished to have had the pleasure of seeing you, of asking you a question, &amp; of thanking you for your kindness to my son George.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>You did not quite understand the last note which I wrote to you, viz about Bell’s precise statement that the conjunctiva of an infant, or young child becomes gorged with blood, when the eyes are forcibly opened, during a <hi rend="underline">screaming</hi> fit.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have carefully kept your previous note, in which you spoke doubtfully about Bell’s statement.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I intended in my former note only to express a wish that if during your professional work, you were led to open the eyelids of a screaming child, you would specially observe this point about the eye showing signs of becoming gorged with blood, which interests me <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi>.— Could you ask anyone to observe this for me in an eye-dispensary or Hospital?</p>
<p>But I now have to beg you kindly to consider one other question, at any time when you may have half an hours leisure.—</p>
<p>When a man coughs violently from choking, or retches violently, even when he yawns, &amp; when he laughs violently, tears come into the eyes. Now in all these cases I observe that the orbicularis muscle is more or less spasmodically contracted, as also in the crying of a child. So again when the muscles of the abdomen contract violently in a propelling manner, &amp; the breath is, I think, always then held, as during the evacuation of a very costive man, &amp; as (I hear) with a woman during severe labour-pain the orbicularis contracts &amp; tears come into the eyes. Sir J. E. Tennant states that tears roll down the cheeks of elephants when screaming &amp; trumpeting at first being captured: accordingly I went to Zoolog. Gardens, &amp; the keeper made 2 Elephants trumpet, &amp; when they did this <hi rend="doubleUnderline">violently</hi> the orbicularis was invariably plainly contracted.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Hence I am led to conclude that there must be some relation between the contraction of this muscle &amp; the secretion of tears.— Can you tell me what this relation is?</p>
<p>Does the orbicularis press against, &amp; so directly stimulate the lachrymal glands? As a slight blow on the eye causes by reflex action a copious effusion of tears, can the slight spasdomic contraction of the orbicularis act like a blow; this seems hardly possible.— Does the same nerve which runs to the orbicularis send off fibrils to the lachrymal glands; &amp; if so, when the order goes for the muscle to contract is nervous force sent sympathetically at the same time to the glands? I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be extremely much obliged if you 〈would〉 have the 〈great〉 kindness to give me your opinion on this point.—</p>
<p>Pray believe me | My dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bowman | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
