<p>I thank you very sincerely and feel much honoured by the trouble which you have taken in giving me your reflections on the origin of Man. It gratifies me extremely that some parts of my work have interested you, and that we agree on the main conclusion of the derivation of man from some lower form.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I will reflect on what you have said, but I cannot at present give up my belief in the close relationship of Man, to the higher Simiæ. I do not put much trust in any single character, even that of dentition; but I put the greatest faith in resemblances in many parts of the whole organization; for I cannot believe that such resemblances can be due to any cause except close blood-relationship<ref target="#foot.f2"/>   That man is closely allied to the higher Simiæ is shewn by the classification of Linnæus who was so good a judge of affinity.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The man who in England knows most about the structure of the Simiæ, namely M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mivart, and who is bitterly opposed to my doctrines about the derivation of the mental powers, yet has publicly admitted that I have not put man too close to the higher Simiæ, as far as bodily structure is concerned.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I do not think the absence of reversions of structure in man is of much weight; C. Vogt indeed argues that Microcephalous idiots is a case of reversion.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> No one who believes in evolution will doubt that the Phocæ<ref target="#foot.f6"/> are descended from some terrestrial carnivore; yet no one would expect to meet with any such reversion in them. The lesser divergeance of character in the races of man in comparison with the species of Simiadæ, may perhaps be accounted for by man having spread over the world at a much later period than did the Simiadæ.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am fully prepared to admit the high antiquity of man; but then we have evidence in the Dryopithecus of the high antiquity of the Anthropomorphous Simiæ.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you are at work on your fossil plants, which of late years have afforded so rich a field for discovery.</p>
<p>With my best thanks for your great kindness and with much respect | I remain Dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>PS Your article on the transformists in the Revue which I read some time ago interested me much.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

Saporta had received a copy of the French edition of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In his letter of 18 March 1872, Saporta had argued that humans developed from a type which originated in a boreal zone, while simians developed in the tropics. Saporta had based his argument for separate orders for humans and simians on a few characteristics, for example, tree-climbing in simians as opposed to walking in humans.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3"><hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> was a Linnaean genus that included most primates except lemurs (<hi rend="italic">Lemur</hi>) and humans (<hi rend="italic">Homo</hi>). These genera were part of the Linnaean order of Primates along with the genus <hi rend="italic">Vespertilio</hi>, which included all bats (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4797.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnaeus 1758–9</ref>). The genus name <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> is no longer used.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3350.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">St George Jackson Mivart</ref> maintained in ‘Ape resemblances to man’ (Mivart 1871d) that there could be no doubt that humans were closely related to the anthropoid division of Old World apes. Mivart concluded, ‘I none the less completely differ from him [CD] when I include the totality of man’s being. So considered, Science convinces me that a monkey and a mushroom differ less from each other than do a monkey and a man.’</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">In his letter of 18 March 1872, Saporta contrasted the prolific speciation in simians with the marked lack of speciation in humans after their divergence from a hypothetical common ancestor. Simiadae was one of three suborders of Primates in <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2486.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Henry Huxley’s</ref> classification, the others being Anthropidae and Lemuridae (T. H. Huxley 1869, p. 99; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 1: 195). Only humans were placed in Anthropidae, with all other apes and monkeys in Simiadae. The modern family Hominidae includes humans along with the great apes (orang-utans, gorillas, and chimpanzees).</note>
