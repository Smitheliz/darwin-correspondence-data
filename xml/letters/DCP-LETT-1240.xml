<p>Many thanks for your most friendly note a fortnight ago. I did not write sooner, till I knew our plans more definitely. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. G. now says we may return home at <hi rend="underline">end</hi> of May (it will be on Friday 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of June that we shall arrive, I hope at dear old Down) but that I shall have to go on with the Aqueous treatment for <hi rend="underline">many</hi> months at home under his direction.— Our remaining here all May will, I hope give us a better <hi rend="underline">chance</hi> of seeing you here, but your account of yourself &amp; gigantic family<ref target="#foot.f1"/> shows that it is but a chance; nevertheless we shall hope for it—</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear that you have not been very well this winter. With respect to myself I believe I am going on very well; but I am rather weary of my present inactive life &amp; the Water Cure has the most extraordinary effect in producing indolence &amp; stagnation of mind; till experiencing it, I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not have believed it possible.— I now increase in weight, have escaped sickness for 30 days, which is thrice as long an interval, as I have had for last year; &amp; yesterday in 4 walks I managed seven miles! I am turned into a mere walking &amp; eating machine.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. G. however finds he is obliged to treat me cautiously, &amp; during last week all my treatment has been much relaxed. There are many patients here even already: last summer I hear he had 120!— He must be making an immense fortune.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Lady Wilmot lives here with her son Col. Wilmot;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have not called, for I was frightened at this great Dandy of a son: if it had been summer I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have called to have seen the flower garden.— You need not send Athenæum<ref target="#foot.f4"/> or Glacier Paper<ref target="#foot.f5"/> till our return to Down.—</p>
<p>Yours very affectionately | C. Darwin</p>
<p>For auld langsyn I have looked for Beetles on the hills here, but cannot find one.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
