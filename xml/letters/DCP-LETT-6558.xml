<p>I have postponed writing to you before in the hope that I might be able to send you some information of value before I started for the interior, which I do in two or three days to search for the source of the Niger. I have unfortunately very little to say— As regards expression I can at present answer but one query.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The head is shaken laterally in negative &amp; nodded in affirmative among the Gold Coast tribes.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I find it exceedingly difficult to seize expressions if not prepared for them (as one w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be in case of a surgical operation). Expression is sudden &amp; momentary— In smiling by the bye I observed two crescent wrinkles at the corners of the mouth, concave side nearest mouth— However I shall try to get something more in that way for you</p>
<p>There is one breed of sheep only on the Gold Coast (where I have spent most of my time since coming out). The rams have horns &amp; manes: the females neither. When castrated not only horns but hair is affected.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have frequently asked about the age at wh. the horns sprout but c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. get no answer. Europeans out here do not observe such things, &amp; the blacks have no idea of time. However I have set three persons to watch, &amp; hope to get a reply on my return from the interior, wh. will be in a few months. There is a breed with both sexes horned in Senegambia (with dewlaps) and another breed of enormous size in the Niger Country in wh. the female has rudimentary horns.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Women in Africa at all events among the more intelligent pagan tribes have no difficulty about getting the husbands they want, although it is considered unwomanly to <hi rend="underline">ask</hi> a man to marry them, &amp; that on the Gold Coast I am informed they never do— They are quite capable of falling in love, and even of forming tender passionate and faithful attachments.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> As a rule tribes do not intermarry but I have little doubt that there are many exceptions. Women do not like to marry strangers visiting their country because they do not like to leave their own families; on the other hand when a Foula or Mandingo comes among the Soosovo or Timmanies (pagan coast tribes in this neighbourhood) they try to make him settle &amp; marry amongst them.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> They like to breed from superior men that the offspring may be of use to the town a <hi rend="underline">fact</hi> rather opposed to the vulgar ideas about African want of foresight. Girls are not forced to marry the choice of the family in certain tribes: in others (of a lower kind) she is   The intermarriage-between-tribes question is an important one. I shall pay attention to it.</p>
<p>I am not likely to see the gorilla up here. At present it is only found a little above Cape S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. John and Loango.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> But so little is known about the interior that the question of its habitat, must be left open. Chimpanzees are found in the bush here. If I see one I will note down whether there is more hair on back or front.</p>
<p>My plans on returning from the Kong Mountains<ref target="#foot.f8"/> (if I get there) are not settled. I want much to study the Upper Niger &amp; Haussa Country<ref target="#foot.f9"/> before I leave Africa but cannot tell whether I shall have the opportunity. I am not likely however to return home just yet. Any queries you may send to me shall be faithfully attended to, as far as lies in my power. The worst of it out here is that one gets no assistance; things which every resident ought to know one has to find out for oneself often in a few days—if one can.</p>
