<p>I am much obliged for the honour of your interesting letter; &amp; it will give me much pleasure to do any thing that you wish, as far as lies in my power. I wrote immediately to a gentleman who had served as one of the judges at the Crystal Palace, for the dates of the reports, &amp; for information about any books on cats.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I heard from him this morning that he was just starting on a journey, but that he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> write to me in a week’s time.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> As soon as I hear I will endeavour to get what you desire, &amp; send you any publications which I can procure. I do not know of any works exclusively on the larger Feline animals; perhaps as good an account as any will be found in Brehm’s Thierleben, which I believe has been translated into French.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am much obliged for your information about the fertility of crossed Angora &amp; common cats. It is not believd by physiologists that the characters of two fathers can be transmitted to one &amp; the same individual; &amp; experiments on plants seem to negative any such belief. But I was reading the other day a paper by Fritz Müller which seemed to render this belief in some degree probable.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I thank you for the kind present of your book, which I shall have great pleasure in reading when I receive it.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Possibly I may find something about the expression &amp; gestures of cats under different emotions; &amp; this is a subject which much interests me.</p>
<p>I have the honour to remain with much respect | yours faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>

In the first part of F. Müller 1872–3, pp. 42–3, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3070.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Fritz Müller</ref> had discussed the apparent influence of two male parents in a single fruit. Müller crossed species of <hi rend="italic">Abutilon</hi>, using pollen from two different species applied to a third species; he noted that an individual crossed fruit produced some seed that showed characteristics of one male parent and some that showed characteristics of the other male parent.
