        <abstract> 
<p>Thanks for congratulations on appearance of abstract of HA’s paper [<hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> 7 (1873): 343–4].</p> 
            <p>Explains again his theory of "contraction with twist" by which compact buds and a spiral phyllotaxy have evolved. Explains how the peculiar phyllotaxy of the teasel is explicable by this process of "condensation".</p>

<p>I am very glad indeed to have your kind letter of congratulation on the first appearance of my paper in print— I have not yet seen it in ‘Nature’, but I understand they have taken the Abstract, which I prepared for publication in the ‘Proceedings’ of the R.S., in which case the words are my own.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The necessary abbreviation in the Abstract has curtailed much of the argument, and has presented some of the points too bluntly, especially that which you stumble upon,—<hi rend="underline">contraction</hi>.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can say what I mean more clearly thus:—</p> 
<figure rend="blockCentred width60"> 
    <graphic url="../images/DCP-LETT-8812.svg"/>
</figure> 
<p>The change from (1) to (4) is what I wish to describe by the words “Contraction with twist.”<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But, looking at (4) alone, without regard to the earlier state, we should certainly be wrong in using the word “contraction”, for the bud, in its individual life-time, only <hi rend="underline">increases</hi> in length:—but it does not (I suppose) reach such a length as was reached by the earlier forms (1), (2), (3):— in comparison with them the axis of (4) is <hi rend="underline">stunted</hi> while the growth of the embryo leaves is not stunted.</p>
<p>To exhibit the above process of contraction to the audience at the R.S., I constructed some large models, in which four dozen india-rubber balls (about 2 inches diameter) represented the embryo leaves; and these I displayed on a tall frame, so that they were held up to view and made to go through their performances in mid-air. I very much wish you could have seen them, and I shall still hope for an opportunity of showing them to you—</p>
<p>I think I have made a new point, confirming the condensation-theory.— The wild <hi rend="underline">teazle</hi> (Dipsacus sylvestris) shows in its composite head a conspicuous set of 26 spirals in one direction, and another set of 16 in the other direction, differing therein from all the normal spiral orders.— But the teazle has its leaves in pairs (in crucial order) and its involucral bracts in pairs: and if we consider what would become of a crucial order <hi rend="underline">under contraction with a twist</hi>, it appears that the following numbers will successively come into contact with any one leaf taken as 0:—</p>
<p>2, 4, 6, 10, 16, 26, 42, 68, &amp;c.—and will produce systems presenting sets of 6, 10, 16, 26 &amp;c. spirals, just such as the teazle presents.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>The teazle-head is manifestly produced by a condensation of a former crucial order,—the very order which is exhibited by its leaves on the stem below the head.</p>
<p>I found the same arrangement (spirals 16 &amp; 26) in 4 out of 100 dandelions whose bald heads I examined last summer— They had taken the condensed crucial order for ‘sport’, I suppose.</p>
<p>I must add these facts to my paper in a note.</p>
<p>With kind regards, | I am, my dear Sir | Very respectfully yours | Hubert Airy Chas. Darwin Esq<hi rend="superscript">re</hi>. F.R.S. | Down.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD’s letter to Airy has not been found. The abstract of Airy’s paper ‘On leaf-arrangement’, published in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of London</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_94.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Airy 1873</ref>), was reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, 6 March 1873, pp. 343–4. See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8745.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Hubert Airy, 21 January 1873</ref> and nn. 1 and 2.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Airy had attached oak galls, representing leaf buds, alternately to each side of a stretched elastic band that was then twisted and released; he wrote that the various spiral arrangements found in nature could be replicated by subjecting the elastic band to different degrees of ‘contraction (with twist)’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_94.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Airy 1873</ref>, p. 177). Airy and CD had corresponded frequently on the subject of leaf arrangement since November 1871 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vols. 19 and 20); Airy had first described the experiment to CD in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8412.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter of [before 15] July 1872</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 20).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Airy had developed a theory that the various regular arrangements of leaves around a stem were products not of any aspect of the development of the mature plants, such as the need to maximise exposure to sunlight, but of the economical arrangement of the embryonic leaves in the bud; for an exposition of this theory, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_94.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Airy 1873</ref>, and also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 20, letters from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_51.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hubert Airy</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8412.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[before 15] July 1872</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8426.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">24 July 1872</ref>. Although Airy did extend his theory to account for other regularly arranged parts of plants, such as the seed-heads of sunflowers (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_94.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Airy 1873</ref>), he never published his observations on the heads of the common teasel (<hi rend="italic">Dipsacus sylvestris</hi> is now <hi rend="italic">Dipsacus fullonum sylvestris</hi>).</note>
