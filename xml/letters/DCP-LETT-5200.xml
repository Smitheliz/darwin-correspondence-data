<p>I was very glad to get your note &amp; the Notts Newspaper. I have seldom been more pleased in my life than at hearing how successfully your lecture went off.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. H. Wedgwood sent us an account, saying that you read capitally &amp; were listened to with profound attention &amp; great applause. She says when your final allegory began “For a minute or two we were all mystified, &amp; then came such bursts of applause from the audience. It was thoroughly enjoyed amid roars of laughter &amp; noise making a most brilliant conclusion.”<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am rejoiced that you will publish y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. lecture, &amp; felt sure that sooner or later it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> come to this; indeed it would have been a sin if you had not done so.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am especially rejoiced, as you give the arguments for occasional transport with such perfect fairness, these will now receive a fair share of attention, as coming from you a professed botanist.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Thanks also for Grove’s address; as a whole it strikes me as very good &amp; original but I was disappointed in the part about species; it dealt in such generalities, that it would apply to any view or no view in particular.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have also to thank you much for a lot of things sent by Parslow—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I must get Sclater’s M.S. copied &amp; then return it, which I will do in a few days.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The Codrington has come safe—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I shall be delighted to receive the Drosera.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> As for Acropera I must beg leave to keep it for some time for it is making new flower stalks, &amp; I have already I find had much better success in fertilising it, than I expected when you were here; so that I am sure I shall find out the dodge.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> And now I have got to beg another favour: I want very much a book which is not in Royal or Linn. libraries— it is “<hi rend="underline">Séringe</hi> Bullet. bot. 1830 p. 117. on the St Valery apple”—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>And now farewell— I do most heartily rejoice at your success, &amp; for Grove’s sake at the brilliant success of the whole meeting.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The year is established by the relationship between this letter and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5199.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, [28 August] 1866</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5199.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, [28 August] 1866</ref>. Hooker evidently enclosed a local Nottingham newspaper report on his lecture on insular floras at the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, but no copy has been found in the Darwin archive. The <hi rend="italic">Nottingham Journal</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Nottingham Daily Express</hi> both carried accounts of Hooker’s lecture on 28 August 1866. The latter account claimed that Hooker had succeeded in making a not very attractive subject highly interesting.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The reference is to Frances Emma Elizabeth Wedgwood. Her letter has not been found but her account of Hooker’s lecture was copied in a <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter from Emma Darwin to William Erasmus Darwin, [September 1866]</ref> (DAR 219.1: 84). She described the humorous conclusion to the lecture as follows: <quote type="quote"> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hooker took just 1 1/2 hour &amp; perhaps it was as well you shortened him &amp; also he read capitally &amp; was listened to with profound attention— There was a crammed theatre the house being quite full for an hour before. When the <hi rend="italic">Sachem</hi> began, for a minute or two we were all mystified &amp; then there came such bursts of applause from the audience first &amp; going on— It was so thoroughly enjoyed amid roars of laughter &amp; noise making a most brilliant conclusion. (Now I must explain a little what the Sachem was. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hooker said that in his travels he had come upon a tribe of Indians who were firmly of opinion that the moon was a fresh creation every month &amp; they thought him very impious for telling them it was the same moon “as if God could not create a fresh moon every month.” However seven years afterwards on meeting the same tribe he found that many of the medicine men &amp; Sachems had begun to see the truth &amp; the opinion was gradually making way with them &amp; then he added that he need not tell them that his first visit to the tribe was at Oxford 7 years ago &amp; that his second was at Notts. now) I thought M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grove’s address as good as it c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be— how I longed for you to hear the noise they made when Charles’ name was mentioned. </quote> For more on the Oxford meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1860, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 8, Appendix VI.</note>
