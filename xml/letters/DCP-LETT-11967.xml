The sole source of doubt which crossed my mind relates to the faces of some monkeys, which, <hi rend="underline">as far as I remember</hi>, are nearly hairless &amp; yet can hardly have been subjected to rubbing. Is not the hairless condition of the feet of animals due to the thickening of the skin? would the hair disappear if the skin was not thickened? But my object in writing was solely to send enclosed, in case you have not seen the later edition of the Descent of man.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The month is established by the reference to Allen’s essay (see n. 2, below). CD evidently wrote April by mistake.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Allen’s essay ‘A problem of human evolution’ was published in <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi> on 1 May 1879 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10450.xml">G. Allen 1879b</ref>). Allen argued that the hair on some parts of the body was initially worn away by long-continued pressure or friction; after this, he suggested, individuals with less hair would have appeared more attractive to their mates, and thus sexual selection completed the process of denudation. He considered the fact that women were less hairy than men as evidence for this argument.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD discussed hair as a sexual characteristic in <hi rend="italic">Descent</hi> 2d ed., pp. 601–4; he remarked that the hairless faces of monkeys allowed the colour of their skin to be more fully displayed during the breeding season.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Many men of science, including <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3350.xml">St George Jackson Mivart</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1262.xml">William Boyd Dawkins</ref>, and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5050.xml">August Weismann</ref>, disagreed with CD’s notion of sexual selection, but <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4935.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Russel Wallace</ref> was one of the strongest critics (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10794.xml">E. Richards 2017</ref>, pp. 466–91; see also Wallace 1877 and <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 25, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11067.xml">letters from A. R. Wallace, 23 July 1877</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11125.xml">3 September 1877</ref>). Wallace also attacked sexual selection in his review of Allen’s book on colour in nature (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10344.xml">G. Allen 1879a</ref>; <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11975.xml">letter from Raphael Meldola, 4 April 1879</ref> and n. 4).</note>
