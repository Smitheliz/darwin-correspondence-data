<p>I trouble you with one line to say that I have looked to my original catalogue, &amp; find that I collected 5 specimens of Snakes at the Galapagos from Charles &amp; James Islands.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> These snakes I briefly describe as far as colour &amp; stripes are concerned in my Catalogue; &amp; as they differ somewhat in colour, &amp; as when I published the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>.Edition no Erpetologist had looked at the snakes, I was led into the blunder of supposing that there were several species.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> This blunder I corrected as soon as M. Bibron had provisionally looked over my collection.—   Perhaps M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell may have some specimens of mine from the Galapagos.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Dated by the reference to CD’s snake specimens from the Galápagos, which Günther discussed in a paper read to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5302.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Zoological Society of London</ref> on 24 January 1860 (see n. 2, below).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD’s catalogue of reptile specimens collected during the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> voyage is in the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8646.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">British Museum</ref> (Natural History). His ‘Diary of observations on zoology’ (DAR 30 and 31) does not contain descriptions of a Galápagos snake. The letter is a response to a paper Günther had read to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5302.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Zoological Society of London</ref> in January (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3204.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Günther 1860</ref>). CD may have attended the meeting: he was in London on 24 January (<ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary) and was keen to discuss the distribution of Galápagos birds with <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4251.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Philip Lutley Sclater</ref>, the secretary of the Zoological Society (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2683.xml" resp="#automat">letter from P. L. Sclater, [3? February 1860]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2684.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to P. L. Sclater, 4 February [1860]</ref>). In the paper, Günther described a new species of snake (<hi rend="italic">Herpetodryas biserialis</hi>, a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Pseudalsophis biserialis</hi>, the Galapagos racer) from the Galápagos Islands and stated that it was the only snake found there. Between the date of the meeting and publication of the paper, Günther’s attention was drawn to CD’s record of a different species of snake on the Galápagos (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3204.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Günther 1860</ref>). CD’s letter supplied additional information that Günther appended in a note to his paper (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3204.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Günther 1860</ref>, p. 97 n.): <quote type="quote"> Darwin says in his Journ. of Research., p. 381, speaking on the Zoology of the Galapagos Islands:—“There is one snake which is numerous; it is identical, as I am informed by M. Bibron, with the <hi rend="italic">Psammophis temminckii</hi> from Chile.” Although subsequently, in the ‘Erpétologie Générale,’ nothing is mentioned by Duméril and Bibron about the occurrence of <hi rend="italic">P. temminckii</hi>, or of any other snake, in these islands, that determination of Bibron may possibly be correct. If such be the case, there are two species of Snakes in that group of islands. </quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">When CD published <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4250.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Journal of researches</hi></ref> in 1839, he did not have access to the detailed descriptions of his reptile collection. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_379.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Bell</ref>, who had agreed to describe the collection for <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6607.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Reptiles</hi></ref>, passed the snakes on to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_432.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gabriel Bibron</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6607.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Reptiles</hi></ref>, p. vi). Bibron, however, was unable to complete the final part of his <hi rend="italic">Erpétologie générale</hi> (Duméril and Bibron 1834–54), and CD’s collection remained undescribed. A pencil note in the back of CD’s copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4252.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Journal of researches</hi> 2d ed.</ref> (<ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_795.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Cambridge University</ref> Library) reads: ‘D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Günter has shown. Zoolog Soc. Jan 24 60 that the snake from Galapagos is distinct from that of St Domingo: American form’. On page 381, in the margin next to the description of the snake, CD noted in ink: ‘No | D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Güunter says endemic species.’ CD managed to insert a note about the snake in the revised ‘postscript’ added to the new issue of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4254.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Journal of researches</hi> (1860)</ref>, p. vii: <quote type="quote"> The snake mentioned at page 381, as being, on the authority of M. Bibron, the same with a Chilian species, is stated by Dr. Günter (Zoolog. Soc., Jan. 24th, 1859) to be a peculiar species, not known to inhabit any other country. </quote> CD erred in the spelling of Günther’s name and in giving 1859 as the year of publication of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3204.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Günther 1860</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The specimens in Bell’s possession (see n. 3, above) were given to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8646.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">British Museum</ref> in 1845 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6351.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Porter 1985</ref>, p. 104). According to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2114.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Donoso-Barros 1975</ref>, p. iii, Günther may have unknowingly described CD’s specimen which, by then, had been for some years in the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8646.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">British Museum</ref> collection.</note>
