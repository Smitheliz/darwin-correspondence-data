<p>I thank you heartily for your improvements, all of which I have adopted and will with your leave send you the part which relates to Sedgwick <hi rend="underline">in type</hi>, that you may have a second opportunity of <hi rend="underline">touching up</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am endeavoring to have the whole address ready for the printer by the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.; so that if possible I may have a proof on Saturday the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>: and a revised sheet on Saturday the 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. <hi rend="underline">at latest</hi>.</p>
<p>Sedgwick will attend himself which will be a great pleasure to us all here. Murchison will <hi rend="underline">not</hi> be present; which is so far well that we shall avoid embarrassment;—to say the least.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Will <hi rend="underline">you</hi> not come up to sit by your friend at dinner. The Society meets, as you know, at 4 <hi rend="smallCaps">PM</hi>. It would be a most gratifying circumstance to Sedgwick, and we, of the council, should feel the benefit of such an evidence of your thorough approval of the Award.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>It may be that I do not partake sufficiently, by reason of my age, of the spirit of the opinions which appear to have taken a strong hold of the younger Geologists and Zoologists. With all respect for Darwin’s great services, and recognising that his recent work on Orchids must be classed amongst these, I cannot see without extreme concern the efforts of a very strong party to obtain the award of the Copley Medal to him expressly on the ground of his conclusions as to the “Origin of Species”.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> A more decided interference that I desire to exercise a second time with the thorough independence of the votes of individual members of the Council, was required to prevent such an award being made in this year instead of to Sedgwick.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> We may not have so good an alternative next year;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> and I cannot but deem it a great misfortune to the RS. that we cannot prevail on the older, &amp; may I say more soberminded of the naturalists to give us their aid in the Council. It is the <hi rend="underline">only</hi> source from which I have any <hi rend="underline">present</hi> anticipation of trouble.</p>
<p>always truly yours | Edward Sabine</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Sabine evidently sent Phillips drafts of the anniversary address that he was to give on 30 November 1863 as the President of the Royal Society (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6832.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sabine 1863</ref>). The anniversary meeting was to include the presentation of medals; see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6832.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sabine 1863</ref>, pp. 31–5, for the presentation of the Copley Medal to Adam Sedgwick. The medal was awarded (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6832.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sabine 1863</ref>, p. 31) for Sedgwick’s: <quote type="quote"> observations and discoveries in the Geology of the Palæozoic Series of Rocks, and more especially for his determination of the characters of the Devonian System, by observations of the order and superposition of the Killas Rocks and their Fossils, in Devonshire. </quote> For a discussion of the significance of medals in Victorian science, particularly the Royal Medal, see MacLeod 1971.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Sedgwick and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3453.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Roderick Impey Murchison</ref> had disagreed over the classification of British Palaeozoic rocks since the 1840s; the two men, once collaborators, were no longer on speaking terms (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7064.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Secord 1986</ref>, pp. 262–8). Murchison had publicly defended his classification as recently as 1861, when he gave the presidential address to the geology section of the thirty-first meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Manchester (Murchison 1861). Murchison had received the Copley Medal in 1849.</note>
