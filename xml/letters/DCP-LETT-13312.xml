<p>Your letter has perplexed me beyond all measure.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I fully recognise the duty of everyone, whose opinion is worth anything, expressing his opinion publicly on vivisection; &amp; this made me send my letter to the Times.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have been thinking at intervals all morning what I could say, &amp; it is the simple truth that I have nothing worth saying. You &amp; men like you, whose ideas flow freely &amp; who can express them easily, cannot understand the state of mental paralysis in which I find myself.</p>
 <p>What is most wanted is a careful &amp; accurate attempt to show what physiology has already done for man, &amp; even still more strongly what there is every reason to believe it will hereafter do.— Now I am absolutely incapable of doing this, or of discussing the other points suggested by you.—</p>
<p>If you wish for my name (&amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be glad that it sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> appear with that of others in the same cause) could you not quote some sentence from my letter in the Times, which I enclose, but please return it.— If you thought fit you might say that you quoted it with my approval, &amp; that after still further reflexion I still abide most strongly in my expressed conviction. <hi rend="doubleUnderline">For Heaven’s sake</hi>, do think of this.— I do not grudge the labour &amp; thought, but I could write nothing worth anyone reading.</p>
<p>Allow me to demur to your calling your conjoint article a “symposium”,—strictly a “drinking party”.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> This seems to me very bad taste, &amp; I do hope everyone of you will avoid any semblance of a joke on the subject.— I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that words, like a joke, on this subject have quite disgusted some persons not at all inimical to physiology.— One person lamented to me that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Simon in his truly admirable Address at the Medical Congress (by far the best thing which I have read) spoke of the “fantastic <hi rend="underline">sensuality</hi>” (or some such term) of the many mistaken, but honest men &amp; women who are half mad on the subject.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Do pray try &amp; let me escape &amp; quote my letter, which in some respects is more valuable as giving my independent judgment before the Medical Congress.—</p>
<p>I really cannot imagine what I could say.—</p>
<p>I will now turn to another subject: My little book on Worms has been long finished, but Murray was so strongly opposed to publishing it at the dead season, that I yielded.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have told the Printers to send you a set of clean sheets, which you can afterwards have stitched together.— There is hardly anything in it which can interest you.—</p>
<p>Two or three papers by Hermann Müller have just appeared in Kosmos, which seem to me interesting as showing how soon, i.e. after how many attempts, Bees learn how best to suck a new flower.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> There is also, a good &amp; laudatory review of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Roux.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I could lend you Kosmos if you think fit.—</p>
<p>You will perhaps have seen that my poor dear brother Erasmus has just died, &amp; he was buried yesterday here at Down.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Many thanks for your kind invitation to my sons, none of whom are likely to be in Scotland.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
