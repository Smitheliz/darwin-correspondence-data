<p>Until the time you called, when I was confined to bed, I was under the sorrowful belief that I was never more either to see or hear from you.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Under those circumstances you will easily imagine how much pleased I was to see your hand writing and find that you had me still in remembrance<ref target="#foot.f2"/>   Had I been in the enjoyment of my ordinary health when your letter reached me you would soon have had something in return but seeing my condition was then and has been ever since very different you will I know ascribe my delay to what has really caused it and not to indifference.</p>
<p>Now that we have a prospect of some improvement in the weather I hope to soon get out of doors and gain what I very much want—strength.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I see you are still as active and enthusiastic as ever and you may rest assured that if I can contribute any thing to you you will have it the moment I can venture a visit to my library which I am told is very cold as there has scarcely been a fire in it since December last. I have no doubt but that I will find among my notes something in regard to the use, which male animals, in South Africa, make of their Horns.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I recollect although I cannot give the full particulars at present that on one occasion we found the skeletons of two Gnu’s <hi rend="underline">Catoblepas</hi> Gnu joined together by the manner in which they had entangled their horns no doubt when <hi rend="underline">fighting</hi>— They fight desperately especially about the time they are courting the females.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> They are doubtless weapons both of offence &amp; defence as I trust I will, when I get a little stronger, be able to prove to you from my notes which I dare not yet attack   I strongly suspect will not find it very easy to give you any thing satisfactory as to what kind of women savage men prefer—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> so far as the Hottentot is concerned I can with certainty say he regards a woman with huge <hi rend="underline">posteriors</hi> as first rate<ref target="#foot.f7"/> and he some time ago used to value highly such of the females as had very lengthened Nympæ but now he rather views these ugly developements as undesirable if not as deformities   I have been told of some who had them so elongated as that they were able during sexual intercourse to encircle the mans loins and fix him by them until the appetite of both was thoroughly satisfied. I have never seen what would admit of any thing like that being effected   still I have seen them pretty long.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Now you must reconcile this speciality in the Hottentot’s formation and let me know what brought it into existence. You must not say it is artificial seeing it comes without their using weights to bring it into existence and as a proof that it is not a formation of their manifacture it still begins to appear at puberty though there is nothing they would not now do to prevent it. In regard to the large posteriors I may mention that I once came in communication with a woman more than ordinarly gifted in that way and it was all but an impossibility for her to get on her feet when she was sitting unless where she could avail herself of some slope of the ground— Where such was open to her she had to work herself round till her back was directed up the slope and if it was considerable she rose with tolerable facility.— This Lady was esteemed a beauty and was the mother of several children—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I find I have just done enough to let me know I am an invalid   you shall however, please God, have more when I am stronger</p>
<p>Yours most faithfully | Andrew Smith—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">The letter to Smith has not been found.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Smith had resigned from his post as director-general of the army and ordnance medical departments in 1858 due to poor health (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5933.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">In his research on sexual selection, CD was curious about the horns of male mammals and whether they were used in fighting for females.</note>

See also J. E. Gray 1852, pp. 119–22, for a contemporary description of gnu species. Smith had been stationed in South Africa from 1820 to 1836 as an army surgeon, and was an authority on South African zoology.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD had also discussed sexual selection as a means of forming the human races with <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4935.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Russel Wallace</ref> (see, for example, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5420.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to A. R. Wallace, 26 February [1867]</ref> and n. 5, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5968.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from A. R. Wallace, 2 March [1867]</ref>).</note>

Earlier in the century, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1170.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Georges Cuvier</ref> had lent scientific authority to travellers’ accounts when he examined the cadaver of an African woman and described what he called the ‘Hottentot apron’ (Cuvier 1817 in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2469.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Fausto-Sterling 1995</ref>, pp. 33–6).
