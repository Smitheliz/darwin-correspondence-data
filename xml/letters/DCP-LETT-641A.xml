            <p>He encloses an unidentified paper received from R. I. Murchison the previous day.</p>
            <p>Is unable to provide information about Dr Du Gard.</p>
            <p>Appreciates the maps of Glen Roy sent by WB. Would welcome the opinions of WB and Louis Agassiz concerning the parallel roads but cannot give up the idea of their marine origin.</p>

<p>I received yesterday the enclosed paper from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Murchison with his pencil marks on it:—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I cannot think of any information to give you relating to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Du Gard.—</p>
<p>He is no relation to any of my family.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I have to thank you for your kindness in sending me long since some maps of the country near Glen Roy, which I daresay will be very useful, if I ever visit that country again—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I should much like to hear your’s &amp; Agassiz’s opinion on the parallel roads, though I believe I know its outline—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I cannot give up the sea, after thinking over many points of minor detail in that country, though, I am very sure, if your theory had occurred to me, during the first two days of my examination, I should have given up their marine and <hi rend="underline">ordinary</hi> lacustrine origin at once<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>But I have no business to trouble you with my notions.</p>
<p>Believe me | dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>

In 1841, 17 February was a Wednesday.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Dugard, physician to the Shropshire Infirmary, and honorary fellow of the Geological Society, died on 19 January 1840 (<hi rend="italic">Gentleman’s Magazine</hi> n.s. 14 (1840): 556). Buckland, who was president of the Geological Society, included a brief obituary notice of him in his anniversary address to the society on 19 February 1841 (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Geological Society of London</hi> 3 (1838–42): 523). Buckland had probably written to CD to ask for information about Dugard to include in his notice. There had been some scandal about Dugard in 1831 and 1832 that is mentioned in CD’s sisters’ letters to CD (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 1).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD visited Glen Roy in June 1838. His paper ‘Parallel roads of Glen Roy’ appeared in 1839. On CD’s theory about the parallel roads, in the context of other nineteenth-century theories about their origin, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6779.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Rudwick 1974</ref>; see also <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 9, Appendix IX. The maps that Buckland sent have not been found in the Darwin Archive–CUL.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Buckland and Agassiz visited Glen Roy together in 1840 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1039.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Buckland 1840</ref>, p. 333). Agassiz’s account of his theory of the glacial origin of the parallel roads of Glen Roy, delivered at the Geological Society on 4 November 1840, was summarised in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Geological Society of London</hi> (J. L. R. Agassiz 1840, p. 332; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6779.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Rudwick 1974</ref>); Buckland’s remarks at the society on 4 or 18 November were also reported (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1039.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Buckland 1840</ref>, p. 333). Buckland and Agassiz had concluded that the parallel roads of Glen Roy were beaches formed as the water of a lake formed by a glacial dam at the foot of the Glen subsided. CD’s theory was that they were beaches of a sea that once covered that area of Scotland (see n. 4, above).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">In the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1182.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Robert Chambers, [June 1848]</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 4), CD wrote of his visit to Glen Roy: ‘during my first two days I was a convert to the lacustrine theory’ (that is, the theory that the parallel roads were remnants of the shores of ancient lakes, though the lake barrier was not at that time thought to have been a glacier); but he also explained that a number of features of the topography of Glen Roy had convinced him that his marine theory was correct. See also <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1119.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Robert Chambers, 11 September 1847</ref>, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6779.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Rudwick 1974</ref>, p. 117. CD did not abandon his marine theory until 1861, when <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2540.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Francis Jamieson</ref>, with the support of CD and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref>, visited Glen Roy. Jamieson published his conclusions in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4144.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Jamieson 1863</ref>.
