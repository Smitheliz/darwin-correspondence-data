<p>I have just returned from Bath,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> quite delighted with my stay there, I laid myself out to see all my friends &amp; enjoyed it most thoroughly. Every-body was asking about you— I had my old friend Campbell of Darjeeling<ref target="#foot.f3"/> staying with me. I had a long walk with Mrs Lubbock<ref target="#foot.f4"/> on Saturday—Lubbock<ref target="#foot.f5"/> having gone to Wokey’s hole<ref target="#foot.f6"/> with Evans, where he picked up some flints-imps.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The sections<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I eschewed, as usual, prowling about the doors, &amp; chatting with heaps of friends— The Geographical section was the favored one, the Geological having gone down in popularity greatly, but poor Spekes death<ref target="#foot.f9"/> cast a gloom over Murchison,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> &amp; Burtons conduct on the occasion disgusted every one.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Crawfurd, Wallace, Bates, a young Lord Milton (a mere boy) &amp; Livingstone were the great guns.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>The Lyells<ref target="#foot.f13"/> are fairly intoxicated with their popularity &amp; success, &amp; can talk of nothing else   The scientificos criticize his speech sharply—the plebs applaud it throughout.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Lyell can think &amp; talk of nothing else—except the cordial welcome that Colenso has had—<ref target="#foot.f15"/> Some clergy actually shook hands with him, &amp; the Dean of Hereford was seen escorting Miss Colenso about to day.—<ref target="#foot.f16"/> in the sections he was greeted with hearty applause on entering the rooms. One parson however preached yesterday against Lyell, Colenso &amp; the British Association!<ref target="#foot.f17"/> The Bath people showed no attention or hospitality at all, so we had delightful little breakfasts &amp; dinners at one anothers lodgings. So my days sped swiftly, &amp; my nights were no worse than I expected.</p>
<p>I made several pleasant acquaintances in primis Mr Symonds (or Simmons?) of whom the Lyells talk so much &amp; with whose daughter my wi〈fe〉 〈    〉 both fell desperately in 〈love〉<ref target="#foot.f18"/>   John Evans, who I had just seen before—&amp; who came up with me in the train—he seems a very sharp fellow, &amp; spoke so well &amp; discriminatingly of Lyell’s “Antiquity”,<ref target="#foot.f19"/> &amp; the unworthyness of taking offence at its demerits—&amp; of attributing sordid motives to its author.</p>
<p>The only drawback to my happiness is that I have got let into 2 visits, first on next Thursday to Lord Ducie, a friend of Henslows, who has asked me several times to his place, I went down with him &amp; Lady D. on Friday<ref target="#foot.f20"/>—&amp; he made such a point of our going to visit him, that we could not get off— they were on their way home (near Bristol) from Italy &amp; I left them at Bath.— today he came 〈    〉 to Bath to clinch us—and 〈    〉 accepted him we could 〈    〉 Dean Dawes who has been asking us ever since I can remember, &amp; who visits us at Kew every year. I suppose I shall have a week of it between them.</p>
<p>My wife is supremely well &amp; as happy as the day is long. The Lubbocks the same.</p>
<p>I have this night heard from Anderson of Calcutta<ref target="#foot.f21"/> that he wants a good gardener at £150 a year &amp; house to superintend a Botanic Garden at Darjeeling, &amp; that he will appoint <hi rend="underline">any one I recommend</hi>.— here is a splendid chance for Scott!<ref target="#foot.f22"/> about whom I am writing— the salary will soon be largely increased if the Curator gives satisfaction, for the garden is not established yet; I shall be <hi rend="underline">very</hi> pleased if Scott gets it;— &amp; proud too. The last gardener I sent out (Mann of Cameroons memory)<ref target="#foot.f23"/> only this time last year, is already advanced to £240 a year &amp; this also in the cool climate of Sikkim.</p>
<p>What a poor affair Herschells answer to the declaration is;<ref target="#foot.f24"/> &amp; after a weeks notice it seems a “mons parturiens”<ref target="#foot.f25"/>   Bowrings is far better.<ref target="#foot.f26"/></p>
<p>Well there is mighty little in this letter, &amp; I begin to fear that my hand-writing is falling off, &amp; not so legible as usual. I could not get Beppo,<ref target="#foot.f27"/> but Mrs Lubbock lent me Romola,<ref target="#foot.f28"/> which is ponderous.</p>
<p>Ever yrs affec | J D Hooker</p>
<p>Huxley Owen &amp; Tyndall<ref target="#foot.f29"/> are greatly desiderated.</p>

The document was widely circulated to members of learned societies in Britain, eventually receiving 717 signatures; it was published in May 1865 as <hi rend="italic">The declaration of students of the natural and physical sciences</hi> (London: Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., [n.d.]). Herschel wrote to the <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi> to protest against being pressed to sign a ‘religious manifesto’, on the grounds that it was both an infringement of his freedom of religious opinion, and an action likely to sow discord in the Christian world. He also insisted that his refusal to sign should not be seen as a profession of atheism or infidelity (see <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi>, 17 September 1864, p. 375).
