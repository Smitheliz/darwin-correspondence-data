<p>I feel Lyell’s loss most keenly, he was father &amp; brother to me; &amp; except yourself, no one took that lively generous hearty deep &amp; warm interest in my welfare that he did.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I cannot tell you how lonely I begin to feel, how desolate, &amp; how heavily the days, &amp; worse still, the nights, hang on my mind &amp; body.— Well! it is all for the best, i.e. the best that man is born to, poor lot as that may be it is one that no one really wishes to exchange for an unknown one: &amp; we are hence logically driven to the conclusion that the sum of life is more happiness than the reverse. Assuredly the sum of happiness derived from having known &amp; loved Lyell is greatly in excess of the pain felt at his loss: the gap he filled has to be compared with the chink his mere absence for the rest of lives opens.</p>
<p>I have arranged for his burial at Westminster Abbey. On Monday I got up a petition signed by some 50 Fellows of the Royal, Geological, &amp; Linnean &amp; at Stanley’s suggestion &amp; promise that it should be attended to, (communicated to Spottiswode), I sent it in yesterday.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It was by mere accident I went to town on the Monday to vote at the Athenæum, heard of Lyell’s death &amp; was enabled to secure so many voters to sign the petition). which had to be sent to the Dean last night!<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Yesterday I saw the family, who were pleased with the prospect. Lyell had left no instructions as to his burial; &amp; Lady Lyell<ref target="#foot.f5"/> had hinted hopes that her husband might be thought deserving of the Abbey. The expence will be about £300: the funeral will in so far be private, that there will be no public procession from the House. I have suggested that the invited persons all meet at the Jerusalem Chamber not in Harley Street.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>As to any other testimonial, I think that this is so incomparably beyond any other that none need be thought of— any other would in my eyes dim the lustre of his memory— his Principles <hi rend="underline">must</hi> live for ever—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> they will no more be forgotten than Plato’s, or Faradays<ref target="#foot.f8"/> works; they will always be classical: The idea of a testimonial being in any way required seems to me rather an underrating of the durability his works.</p>
<p>Then too there is immense force in what you say of such testimonials only succeeding in cases of strong personal attachment, which Lyell did not succeed in obtaining. Even in Falconers case it took a huge pull to get the money, &amp; his brother’s share was not the least!<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Lyell leaves no family connection to pull at people’s purse-strings.</p>
<p>I do not yet know when the funeral is to be, but hope to hear today— if before I close this I will let you know</p>
<p>I have arranged I hope to send Harriet to Algiers straight I hope early next month to stay with Mrs Playfair till I come, which will be about middle of April, after the R. S. Selection of Candidates— I must be back on 26 May for “Reception”— at B. House.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Harriet is far from well &amp; I am ordered to send her abroad. I shall be glad to get away too. for I have a frequent load on the chest just underneath the sternum— I suppose dyspepsia. it comes on when I get anxious I find, &amp; then remains. I am of course worried—&amp; am now again complaining of “my Lord”— he has received a petition to open the Garden in the forenoon, from this neighbourhood &amp; appointed tomorrow to receive a deputation on the subject, &amp; never told me of one or the other!<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I do not suppose he will sanction it; if he does I must resign— As it is I am sending him a vigorous remonstrance &amp; shall Report his conduct privately to the Treasury.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have stood 5 years of this worry &amp; am sick of it.—</p>
<p>Mitford &amp; I pull together—. My Lord has cut him, does all business (as he calls it) through the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Secy, &amp; commands the latter never to mention Mitford by name in his presence! Ayrton is at the bottom of it all, &amp; chuckling over it.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Galton of course supports my Lord, I am told by the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Secretary, who is a staunch friend to me that Galton has pooh-poohed the idea of a Secretary for me;<ref target="#foot.f14"/> but as nothing is too bad to be attributed to Galton, I will not quite believe so bad of him on an Enemys Evidence—</p>
<p>The Royal Socy is my “great consolation” everything there is smooth &amp; pleasant so far.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
