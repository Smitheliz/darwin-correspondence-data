<p>I will send you in a few days a copy of a new Edit. of my Orchids, as I think the account of <hi rend="underline">Catasetum tridentatum</hi> is worth your reading as a striking instance of atavism accompanied by sterility.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I read German so slowly, and have had lately to read several other papers, so that I have as yet finished only half of your first essay and two-thirds of your second.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> They have excited my interest and admiration in the highest degree, and whichever I think of last seems to me the most valuable. I never expected to see the coloured marks on caterpillars so well explained; and the case of the ocelli delights me especially.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I think that the enclosed extract will interest you; I confess that the view formerly seemed to me fanciful, but it does so no longer.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Do you know Caligo eurolochus? M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Butler, one of our best Lepidopterists, showed me a specimen some years ago, and said that he believed the immense ocelli on the under side of the wings, served to frighten any animal which approached the butterfly from beneath.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>I told M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Butler your views about the stripes on caterpillars; and he told me that a friend who was a good collector, shewed him a bush of Ligustrum with excrement beneath it, from which circumstance he was sure that there was a caterpillar of Sphynx ligustri living on it; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. B. and his friend could neither of them find it until they searched every branch from base to top.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Butler also mentioned to me the case of a caterpillar with long thin hairs, standing out laterally, which make it very difficult to be discovered as it presents no defined outline.</p>
<p>There is one other subject which has always seemed to me more difficult to explain than even the colours of caterpillars, and that is the colour of birds’ eggs, and I wish you would take this up.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>I saw two or three days ago, Sir J. Lubbock, and he expressed the liveliest interest about your book.</p>
                    <p> With my best thanks, and much respect | I remain, my dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin.</p>
                    <p>P.S.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bates tells me of a clergyman, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hallins and another gentleman who have a most beautiful, accurate and large collection of drawings <hi rend="underline">of all the stages</hi> of the caterpillars of British Lepidoptera. They cannot afford to publish the collection. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bates thinks that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hebbins would lend you his share of the drawings, if they would be of interest to you to examine them, but the other man, a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Buckler is bitter against evolution and probably would not lend his share, which is the <hi rend="underline">larger</hi> one.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Please inform me whether you think an examination of the drawings would be useful to you, and then we could try. I am going to lend your book to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bates.</p>

Weismann’s name is on CD’s presentation list (see Appendix IV). CD had expanded his discussion of the three sexual forms of <hi rend="italic">Catasetum tridentatum</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">C. macrocarpum</hi>). One of the forms CD discussed was the hermaphrodite <hi rend="italic">Myanthus barbatus</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Catasetum barbatum</hi>); he remarked, ‘Myanthus, though having the organs of both sexes apparently perfect, is sterile; it has therefore had its sexual constitution disturbed, and this seems to have caused it to revert in character to a former state’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6011.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 205).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD probably forwarded the extract that had been sent to him by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_317.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Henry Walter Bates</ref> describing a snake-like caterpillar (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10780.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from H.
