<p>You see I have taken the precaution of breaking up a very few days earlier than we intended— I feared possibilities.</p>
<p>I rejoice to hear that your boy is nearly convalescent.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I shall send some work for the holidays, part of which is to be remitted to me in about a month. The more formal Examination I must defer until August 12 when the school re-assembles.</p>
<p>I am | dear Sir | faithfully yours | C. Pritchard</p>
<p>I desire my respects to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin.</p>
<p>I shall hunt for Pollen tubes in the I. Wight: but not under -/10—but try what I can do with an erecting eye-piece and inch object glass giving me a power <hi rend="italic">[</hi>lumina<hi rend="italic">]</hi> of about 90.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Pritchard, whose main interests were mathematics and astronomy, was also interested in botany, having at Clapham, ‘one of the finest fernaries in England’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2063.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>). Although CD and Pritchard evidently corresponded on botanical topics, these letters have not been found. In his memoirs (A. Pritchard ed. 1897, p. 60), Pritchard recalled that George Darwin had, while a pupil at Clapham, asked him ‘to read with him certain portions of his illustrious father’s book on <hi rend="italic">The Fertilisation of Orchids</hi>.’ He continued: ‘More than gladly I did as he desired, and in due time we succeeded in fertilising and ripening the seeds of Oncidium Papilio; but we did not succeed in our attempts to induce the seeds to germinate, as his father challenged us to do: the necessary environments were wanting.’ Pritchard left his post at Clapham Grammar School in 1862, and moved to Freshwater on the Isle of Wight (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2063.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>).</note>
