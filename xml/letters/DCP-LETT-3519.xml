<p>Sends additions and corrections for 2d German ed. of <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> [1862–3].</p>  
<p>Before a German translation of <hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi> is done, CD thinks HGB should read part of it and decide if it is worth while; CD has doubts.</p>

<p>At last I have found time to correct the Origin.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have compared the sheets of the Third English Edition with the Second which was translated into German, &amp; have marked with a pencil line all the additions &amp; corrections. Some of these additions were sent to you in M.S formerly,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but as I do not know which, I have marked all. As I am so poor a German scholar, it would take me a long time to compare all, but it will lose you very little time. Where merely a few words have been altered I have underlined them with pencil: where a sentence has to be omitted I have marked “dele”. I also send a few new M.S. additions &amp; corrections.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> You will, perhaps, be surprised at some of the additions, &amp; will think them trifling.; I could of course have amplified many parts, but I have been guided almost solely in enlarging the parts which have been most criticised. I much regret to think that the additions will cause you some trouble: but I very much hope you will add to the load of kindness already conferred on me by looking through the English Sheets &amp; correcting the new German Edition by them. As corrected sheets, cannot go by Post, I send them addressed to you to the care of M<hi rend="superscript">essrs</hi>. Schweizerbart, through M<hi rend="superscript">essrs</hi> Williams &amp; Norgate.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I must add that some of the M.S. additions to <hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> </hi> German Edition, have since been a little modified.</p>
<p>In your very kind letter of March 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, you say that M. Scheweizerbart is willing to publish a translation of my Book on Orchids;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not be easy at his undertaking this until you or some one had read part &amp; had expressed to him whether you thought it worth translation. I am quite doubtful. Will you have the great kindness to read Ch. I &amp; tell M. Sweizerbart what you think. If I do not deceive myself the two last chapters VI &amp; VII are a good deal the best in the Book.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> In the hope that you will do this I will send by Post to you in about a week, the first half of volume in sheets. There are 35 wood cuts. With respect to electrotype copies, I have had some little difficulty. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Murray, who publishes at his own risk, demurred rather, &amp; said he thought M. Schweizerbart ought to pay a little more than the mere cost of the copies. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Murray, however, at last agreed: he said the copies on average would cost 5<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> each; therefore altogether <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>8:<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>15:0.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> It would be pleasanter to me, if M. Scheweizerbart would pay a little more, say <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>10, to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Murray. But the cost perhaps will stop his wishing to produce a Translation. When you, or anyone M. Schweizerbart may employ, has read part, <hi rend="underline">or the whole</hi>, &amp; has decided, if he would write to me I would get the copies of the woodcuts made.—</p>
<p>The English Edition is printed in much larger type than is necessary. I will soon send the second half of volume, as it will soon be printed. Can you forgive me causing you so much trouble.</p>
<p>With sincere respect | Yours truly obliged | Ch. Darwin</p>

The regulations of the German Postal Union prohibited the circulation by post of letters above 50 g in weight, classifying heavier items as freight (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 62–3).
