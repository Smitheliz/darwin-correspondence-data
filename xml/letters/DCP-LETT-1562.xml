            <p>CD welcomes the prospect of the Philosophical Club of the Royal Society as means for seeing old acquaintances and making new ones. Will try to go up to London regularly.</p>
            <p>Admits that the warning from JDH and Asa Gray (that more harm than good will come from combat over the species issue) makes him feel "deuced uncomfortable".</p>
            <p>Reflects upon the complexity of Agassiz; how singular that a man of his eminence and immense knowledge "should write such wonderful stuff &amp; bosh".</p>

<p>I had hoped that you would have had a little breathing time after your Journal, but this seems to be very far from the case; &amp; I am the more obliged (&amp; somewhat contrite) for the long letter received this morning, <hi rend="underline">most</hi> juicy with news &amp; <hi rend="underline">most</hi> interesting to me in many ways. I am very glad indeed to hear of the reforms &amp;c in Royal Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. <ref target="#foot.f1"/> With respect to the Club,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am deeply interested; only two or three days ago, I was regretting to my wife, how I was letting drop &amp; being dropped by nearly all my acquaintances, &amp; that I would endeavour to go oftener to London; I was not then thinking of the Club, which, as far as any one thing goes, would answer my exact object in keeping up old &amp; making some new acquaintances. I will therefore come up to London for every (with rare exceptions) Club-day &amp; then my head, I think, will allow me on an average to go to every other meeting. But it is grievous how often any change knocks me up. I will further pledge myself, as I told Lyell, to resign after a year if I did not attend pretty often, so that I should <hi rend="underline">at worst</hi> only encumber the Club temporarily. If you can get me elected, I certainly shall be very much pleased.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>—Very many thanks for answers about Glaciers. I am very glad to hear of the second Edit. so very soon; but am not surprised for I have heard of several, in our small circle, reading it with very much pleasure. I shall be curious to hear what Humboldt will say; it will, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think, delight him &amp; meet with more praise from him, than any other book of Travels, for I cannot remember one, which has so many subjects in common with him. What a wonderful old fellow he is.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I suppose you know that Sir H. Holland wrote the Quarterly Review;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> but very probably he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not like this to be spread.—</p>
<p>What a very singular &amp; striking coincidence is the result you mention in regard to the affinities of Noggerathus &amp; Salisburia;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I know the latter by sight, &amp; am astonished to hear that it is a Conifer.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Good Heavens what work there is in you,—, to hear of your 150 pages, 4<hi rend="superscript">to</hi>, in smallish print, of Introduction<ref target="#foot.f8"/> is enough to make me shudder; though if it is in the least like the New Zealand Introduction, it will be, I am sure, worth any amount of labour.—</p>
<p>By the way, I hope, when you go to Hitcham towards the end of May you will be forced to have some rest.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I am grieved to hear that all the bad symptoms have not left Henslow; it is so strange &amp; new to feel any uneasiness about his health.— I am particularly obliged to you for sending me Asa Gray’s letter;<ref target="#foot.f10"/> how very pleasantly he writes. To see his &amp; your cautions on the species-question ought to overwhelm me in confusion &amp; shame; it does make me feel deuced uncomfortable. I cannot quite understand why you &amp; he think so strongly that it “does more harm than good to combat such views.”— It is delightful to hear all that he says on Agassiz:<ref target="#foot.f11"/> How very singular it is that so <hi rend="underline">eminently</hi> clever a man, with such <hi rend="underline">immense</hi> knowledge on many branches of Natural History, should write such wonderful stuff &amp; bosh as he does. Lyell told me that he was so delighted with one of his (Agassiz) lectures on progressive development &amp;c &amp;, that he went to him afterwards &amp; told him “it was so delightful, that he could not help all the time wishing it was true”.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I seldom see a Zoological paper from N. America, without observing the impress of Agassiz’s doctrine’s,—another proof, by the way, of how great a man he is.— I was pleased &amp; surprised to see A. Gray’s remarks on crossing, obliterating varieties,<ref target="#foot.f13"/> on which, as you know, I have been collecting facts for these dozen years.—</p>
<p>How awfully flat I shall feel, if I when I get my notes together on species &amp;c &amp;c, the whole thing explodes like an empty puff-ball.—</p>
<p>Do not work yourself to death</p>
<p>Ever yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I almost forgot to say that I will return all the Books, which I have of yours.—viz “the Plant”,—“Wallace”—“Salt-Lake”,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> on Wednesday next by carrier who shall book and pay them to Kew by Parcels Delivery on Thursday. Very many thanks for this most valuable loan, than which I do not know when I have had a more interesting set.— We have kept these books an unconscionable time.</p>

CD’s comment may relate to the fact that both organisms were once common but are now represented by only one or a few species living in sub-tropical and tropical regions.

They refer to Gray’s belief that ‘representative species’ arose from similarities of climate in the areas where they were found.
