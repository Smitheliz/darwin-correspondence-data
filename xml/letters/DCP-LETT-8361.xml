<p>Thank you very much for your kind letter received this morning with its very handsome enclosure for young May.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I really do not know what to do about it: the lad is a mere boy, only 18 years old, who has never earned a penny in his life, and had no idea of being paid for what he did. He <hi rend="underline">gave</hi> me the sketches, and understood perfectly that there was no money to be given for them: he has been brought up as one of your disciples, and was delighted at the notion of doing any thing which might by any chance be of use to you; but yet I cannot find it in my heart to take a couple of guineas out of a boy’s mouth when I remember how mine would have watered at the thought of them at his age. For I make no doubt that they are the first that he has ever had offered him for the work of his hands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you very likely will not use the drawings at all, in which case I shall have been the means of putting you to needless expence, and repaid your kindness &amp; hospitality in a way which does not please me—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>However on a balance of consideration I have resolved to send your note and cheque to the boy, and, as I know that he would be utterly uncertain what to do, shall tell him to write you a line of thanks and acknowledgement:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> at the same time if you want the fawning dog drawn on wood I might venture to pledge him to reproduce it, and he would feel much more comfortable in taking the money if he was to feel that you had not paid it for something which was useless to you— Still, if it could be done by photography it would be better still. I shall be proud to send the second edition of “Erewhon” which is now in preparation. I should have sent the first, but I felt very uncertain how far you might approve the book, and in your answer to my letter you told me that you had sent for it. I have set myself quite straight in the preface about having intended no villainy by the machines, and I have added a bit or two here and there—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>With kind regards and many thanks to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin and yourself for a visit of which I shall always retain a most agreeable recollection<ref target="#foot.f5"/> | I am | Your’s very truly | S. Butler</p>
