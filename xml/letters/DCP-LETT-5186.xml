<p>If my letters did not génér you,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> it is impossible that you should suppose that your’s were of no use to me! I would throw up the whole thing were it not for correspondence with you; which is the only bit of silver in the affair. I do feel it disgusting to have to <hi rend="underline">make a point</hi> of a speciality in which one cannot see one’s way—a bit further than I could before I began.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> To be sure I have a very much clearer notion of the pros &amp; cons on both sides—(though these were rather forgotten facts than rediscoveries) I see the sides of the well further down &amp; more distinctly but the bottom is as obscure as ever—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I think I know Origin by heart in relation to the subject.—&amp; it was reading it that suggested the queries about Azores boulders &amp; Madeira bird: the former you &amp; I have talked over, &amp; I thought I remembered that you wanted it confirmed.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The latter strikes me thus— Why should plants &amp; insects have been so extensively changed &amp; Birds not at all? I perfectly understand &amp; feel the force of your argument—in reference to Birds per se but why do these not apply to insects &amp; plants?<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Can you not see, that this suggests the conclusion, that the plants are derived one way &amp; the Birds another!</p>
<p>I certainly did <hi rend="underline">take it for granted</hi> that you supposed the stocking by occasional transport to be something even <hi rend="underline">more</hi> than a “well established hypothesis”—but disputants seldom stop to measure the strength of their antagonists opinion.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I shall be with you on Saturday week I hope.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I should have come before, but have made so little progress that I could not. I am now at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Helena, &amp; shall then go to &amp; finish with, Kerguelen’s Land.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

<p>Cape Roch to S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Michaels 741 Cape Race to Flores 1035.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p> </figure> 
<p>Azores to nearest temperate State is nearly double the distance—but to my mind does not mend the matter.—for I do not ask why Azores have even proportionally (to distance) <hi rend="underline">smaller</hi> number of American plants, but why they have <hi rend="underline">none</hi>, seeing the winds &amp; currents set that way.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>The Bermudas are all American in Flora—but from what Col Munro<ref target="#foot.f11"/> informs me, I should say they have nothing but common American weeds &amp; the Juniper. (Cedar)<ref target="#foot.f12"/>—no changed forms—yet they are as far from America as Azores from Europe. I suppose they are modern &amp; out of the pale.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>You say (“Coral Reefs” 205) that they “ought to have been colored red”— but you do not say on what map. I do not find them on 3.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>There is this, to me, <hi rend="underline">astounding</hi> difference between certain Oceanic Islands which were stocked by continental extension &amp; those stocked by immigration (following in both definitions your opinion)—that the former do contain many types of the more distant continent, the latter do not any!!!! Take Madagascar with it’s many Asiatic Genera unknown in Africa;—Ceylon with many Malayan types not Peninsula Indian.— Japan with many non Asiatic American types—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>Baird’s fact of Greenland migration I was aware of since I wrote my Arctic paper—<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I wish I was as satisfied either of continental or of transport means, as I am of my Greenland hypothesis! oh dear me what a comfort it is to have a belief—(sneer away—)<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>

In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, CD considered the erratic boulders of the Azores on page 363 and the birds of Madeira on page 391.

            <note xml:id="foot.f13">CD had noted that the Bermuda islands were fringed by coral reefs (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1571.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Coral reefs</hi></ref>, p. 205), and presented evidence that islands with ‘fringing reefs’ had been formed more recently than other islands (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 131–8). Hooker implies that there had not been time for endemic species to develop on Bermuda by the action of natural selection.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f14">Plate 3 in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1571.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Coral reefs</hi></ref> distinguishes three different classes of coral islands by colour; however, the West Indies appear at the edge of the plan, which consequently shows no Atlantic islands lying east of Barbados. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1571.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Coral reefs</hi></ref>, p. 205, CD wrote that the Bermuda islands ‘ought to have been coloured red’ owing to their fringing reefs (see n. 13, above), but that they were left uncoloured because they had some features in common with another class of coral island, the lagoon island or atoll.</note>

The identity of elephants in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and India had been used as evidence that Ceylon and India were once connected by dry land (Falconer 1863, pp. 94–6). CD also believed that Japan was once similarly joined to mainland China (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 7, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2321.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 11 August [1858]</ref>).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f17">In his essay ‘Outlines of the distribution of Arctic plants’ Hooker hypothesised that Greenland represented the western boundary of the European flora, owing to the predominance of European species and lack of Asiatic and American species (J. D. Hooker 1860a, p. 252). Hooker also endorsed CD’s theory of plant migrations southward from the Arctic during a former cold period (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 365–82), and argued that Greenland has an anomalous flora, because of its lack of a former southward connection to land on which migration could have proceeded (J. D. Hooker 1860a, p. 254). Hooker and CD subsequently discussed continental extension and occasional transport in relation to the flora of Greenland (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10).
