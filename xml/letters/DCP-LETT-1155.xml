<p>I received yesterday your note with the good tidings of the great liberality of the Trustees.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Now if I do not make a tolerably good Monograph, it will be purely my own fault.</p>
<p>Do you think I ought to write to thank the Trustees; if so will you be so very kind as to send me one line to say so: if I do <hi rend="underline">not</hi> hear, I shall understand that I had better not write.— Upon second thougths I think I had better write, as it cannot do harm &amp; it is better to be on the too civil side; I will enclose a note to you, to be laid before the Trustees.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>With respect to the specimens, I am not ready for them; for I have lately been going backwards ie finding out points in the Anatomy which require days on days of work. I do not now suppose I shall be ready for the species part for 6 weeks.— I shall commence with the pedunculated division.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I will, however, see you &amp; consult with you, how much I had better have at first. I fear it will cost you, or some of your subordinates, a good deal of trouble making out the list. I should be <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> glad to have as many names of genera &amp; of species, when such have been anywhere described, affixed, as you can have the kindness &amp; patience to give me. Without your assistance I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> break down with the synomony.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> But I will talk on this head with you, when we meet. I have now the whole of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stutchburys collection &amp; he seems to have named his partly from the B. Museum, which will be of some assistance.</p>
<p>I cannot too strongly express how deeply I have been gratified by your letter to the Trustees. Your conduct has been most generous &amp; handsome, &amp; I shall never forget it—</p>
<p>Pray believe me | Yours most sincerely obliged | C. Darwin</p>

In the preface to <hi rend="italic">Living</hi> <hi rend="italic">Cirripedia</hi> (1851): x–xi, CD stated his policy on recording synonyms as follows: <quote> I have given much fewer synonyms than is usual in conchological works; this partly arises from my conviction that giving references to works, in which there is not any original matter, or in which the Plates are not of a high order of excellence, is absolutely injurious to the progress of natural history, and partly, from the impossibility of feeling certain to which species the short descriptions given in most works are applicable;—thus, to take the commonest species, the <hi rend="italic">Lepas anatifera</hi>, I have not found a single description (with the exception of the anatomical description by M. Martin St. Ange) by which this species can be certainly discriminated from the almost equally common <hi rend="italic">Lepas Hillii</hi>. I have, however, been fortunate in having been permitted to examine a considerable number of authentically named specimens, (to which I have attached the sign (!) used by botanists,) so that several of my synonyms are certainly correct.</quote></note>
