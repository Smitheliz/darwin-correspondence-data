        <abstract> 
<p>Invites criticisms of his book [<hi rend="italic">Origin</hi>] which is "only an abstract &amp; very much condensed". Knows LJ will not agree with the lengths to which CD goes. It took long years to convert CD, but he cannot persuade himself "that a theory which explains … several large classes of facts, can be wholly wrong".</p> 
            <p>Hopes to publish his full MS if he ever gets strong enough.</p>

<p>I must thank you for your very kind note forwarded to me from Down.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have been much out of health this summer &amp; have been hydropathising here, for last six weeks with very little good as yet.— I shall stay here for another fortnight at least.</p>
<p>Please remember that my Book is only an abstract &amp; very much condensed &amp; to be at all intelligible must be carefully read. I shall be very grateful for any criticisms. But I know perfectly well that you will not at all agree with the lengths which I go.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It took long years to convert me.— I may of course be egregiously wrong; but I cannot persuade myself that a theory which explains (as I think it certainly does) several large classes of facts, can be wholly wrong; notwithstanding the several difficulties which have to be surmounted somehow, &amp; which stagger me even to this day.</p>
<p>I wish that my health had allowed me to publish in extenso; if I ever get strong enough I will do so, as the greater part is written out, &amp; of which M.S. the present volume is an abstract.—</p>
<p>I fear this note will be almost illegible; but I am poorly &amp; can hardly sit up.</p>
<p>Farewell with thanks for your kind note &amp; pleasant remembrances of good old days | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
