<p>Many thanks my old Shipmate for your kind message which I have just rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. by the padre,<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I thought you had quite forgotten that I was in existence, and certainly the man who voluntarily sets himself down in such a place as this has no right to grumble if he f〈inds〉 such to be the case.</p>
<p>As it appears howev〈er〉 you have still two of my sketches hanging up in your room.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I hope you will not refuse to accept another which I shall have much pleasure in preparing and will send to you by the next mail,<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Your “book of the season” as the reviewers have it, I must own I have not yet read, altho M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clarke offered to lend it me, I am afraid of your eloquence, and I don’t want to think I have an origin in common with toads and tadpoles, for if there is anything in human 〈n〉ature that I hate it is a toady, but of course I know nothing of the subject, and they do make such microscopes now a-days— I suppose yours is one of Ross’s very best,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> by the by I got him to make two eyepieces for a reflecting telescope just before he died as I had succeeded in casting and polishing two metals of 6 and 7. feet focus, and so now I shew the good people here the mountains in the moon turned up side down, as of course they ought to be when seen from the antipodes.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>but I must apologize, for I suppose you don’t laugh at nonsense now as you used to do in “Beagle or rather I suppose it does not come in your way.</p>
<p>Well, that was a jolly cruize, and I hope you have been well and happy ever since—and that you may continue so for some time to come is Believe me | the sincere wish | of your old shipmate | Conrad Martens.</p>
<p>PS. | I wonder whether, the Admiral, what is now,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I should like to send my kind regards, if you should see him, but don’t if you don’t like,— coffee without sugar, you remember.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
