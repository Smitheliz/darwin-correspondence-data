<p>I was in Spitalfields recently &amp; had some further conversation with a bird catcher, he said it was a common thing to catch 6 or 7 male chaffinches from one nest, and further observed that there was a great disproportion of the sexes in Blackbirds, the males being by far the more numerous, they are caught in great numbers by a decoy bird placed in a cage with a trap over it, one man he said had thus caught 60 in a short time, all males, their pugnacity leading to their capture.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Yet he observed when they are caught by bat folding the males are still far more numerous than the females.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Blackbirds are very pugnacious &amp; cannot be kept in an aviary with other birds   Thrushes have exactly the opposite character.—</p>
<p>I have sometimes thought there was some connection between the beauty of ♂ birds and their pugnacity, and between their pugnacity &amp; the greater commonness of the male sex.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Robins however are nearly alike in both sexes, yet they fight in the Autumn, this appears to me to arise from the necessity there is for an insectivorous non-migratory bird to have in the winter a district to itself over which it may succeed in obtaining a subsistence.</p>
<p>The robin is however migratory in some parts of Europe &amp; this very irascible bird is then known to associate in small flocks.—</p>
<p>It would be very interesting to ascertain whether it is as quarrelsome in Northern Europe as in England.—</p>
<p>There is an old Greek proverb which shews it is in Southern Europe—quite as pugnacious.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>The black hen Bullfinch has succeeded at last in gaining the affections of the male bird, but she had to do all the courting but now they are paired I observe that when he makes his advances he distends his breast feathers so as to make at least <hi rend="underline">one third more of the red</hi> <hi rend="underline">color visible in front</hi>.—</p>
<p>I have twice reintroduced the old hen, but the dark one still pursues her in the most relentless manner, causing her to take refuge behind a box &amp; there keeping her prisoner for hours.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>My brother was here yesterday &amp; he has some facts for you, but he has not sufficient leisure at present to write, for fear he may forget to tell you, I may as well say, that, he has ascertained that there are often in Starlings nests as many as <hi rend="underline">nine</hi> eggs (9) this I think proves that more than one hen had laid in the nest.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Have you seen the case in the Newspapers of a lamb being brought forth with the (W) mark in black wool, which was the flock mark of the owner &amp; was used on the dams side.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I have some very curious observations on Ivies which will form the subject of my next letter.—</p>
<p>You can form no idea of the pleasure it gives me to find you are interested in my line of thought.—</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | J Jenner Weir <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
