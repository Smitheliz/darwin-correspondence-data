        <abstract> 
<p>Thanks for AdeC’s <hi rend="italic">Phytographie</hi> [1880]. CD finds in it a number of "philosophical" remarks new to him. The work would have been invaluable to him in dealing with puzzles when writing his cirripede monographs.</p> 
            <p>Describes his system of keeping notes on separate pieces of paper filed in several scores of large portfolios.</p> 
<p>Has just sent MS of <hi rend="italic">Movement in plants</hi> to the printer. Thinks he has suceeded in showing "that all the more important great classes of movements are due to the modification of a kind of movement common to all plants from their earliest youth".</p>

<p>I am particularly obliged to you for having so kindly sent me your Phytographie; for if I had merely seen it advertised, I should not have supposed that it could have concerned me.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> As it is, I have read with very great interest about a quarter, but will not delay longer thanking you. All that you say seems to me very clear &amp; convincing, &amp; as in all your writings I find a large number of philosophical remarks new to me, &amp; no doubt shall find many more. They have recalled many a puzzle through which I passed when monographing the Cirripedia; &amp; your book in those days would have been quite invaluable to me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It has pleased me to find that I have always followed your plan of making notes on separate pieces of paper: I keep several scores of large portfolios, arranged on very thin shelves about 2 inches apart, fastened to the walls of my study, &amp; each shelf has its proper name or title, &amp; I can thus put at once every memorandum into its proper place.— Your book will, I am sure, be very useful to many young students, &amp; I shall beg my son Francis, (who intends to devote himself to the physiology of plants) to read it carefully.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>As for myself I am taking a fortnight’s rest after sending a pile of M.S. to the Printers, &amp; it was a piece of good fortune that your book arrived as I was getting into my Carriage, for I wanted something to read whilst away from home.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> My M.S. relates to the movement of Plants, &amp; I think that I have succeeded in showing that all the more important great classes of movements are due to the modification of a kind of movement common to all parts of all plants from their earliest youth.</p>
                    <p>Pray give my kind remembrances to your son<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; with my highest respect &amp; best thanks, believe me | My dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
                    <p>P.S. It always pleases me to exalt Plants in the organic scale, &amp; if you will take the trouble to read my last Chapter, when my book (which will be sadly too big) is published &amp; sent to you, I hope &amp; think that you also will admire some of the beautiful adaptations by which seedling plants are enabled to perform their proper functions<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
