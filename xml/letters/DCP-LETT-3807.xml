            <p>Sends CD West Ireland soundings.</p> 
<p>More detail on his review "a la Lindley" [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">3797</hi>].</p>  
<p>Bates’s paper ["Contributions to an insect fauna of the Amazon valley", <hi rend="italic">Trans. Linn. Soc. Lond.</hi> 23 (1862): 495–566] is capital.</p> 
            <p>Andrew Murray’s article plays into CD’s hands through sheer ignorance.</p>
            <p>JDH is on Royal Society Council.</p> 
<p>Has no recollection of applying natural selection to Polynesians. None but a German would dig out such a passage if it exists [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">3812</hi>].</p> 
            <p>Has caused Tyndall to modify his pseudo-geology.</p> 
<p>Has not seen Duke of Argyll’s review [<hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Rev.</hi> 116 (1862): 378–97]. [The Duke] did not understand <hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi> the least little bit, nor the <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi>, when JDH saw him.</p>

<p>I thought you might care to see these W. Ireland Soundings, showing the bank tailing off to the South, burn it when done with, as I have a copy in Nautical Journal<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am horrified at your telling me that I have made an allusion to R Brown that might seem Lindleyitish, for certainly that was the last point in which I should have tried to write like him.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I had indeed forgotten that I made any allusion to Brown   In apeing Lindly I went no further, to my knowledge, than trying to treat the subject as I thought he might could would or should have, &amp; setting out with a rather clumsy force of wording, which he delights in. I have not reread any of it but the last column of the last article, where I was at first exceedingly puzzled to recover my meaning, (which is not very like Lindley!) I mean where I allude to the bearing of the whole thing on your theory.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>What a capital article Bates has made in his paper in Linn. Trans.<ref target="#foot.f5"/>   I have written to him about it, calling attention to the weakness of the paragraph at p. 508 about the effect of physical causes on variation.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>What a poor paper Murrays is! he does not in the least see how he is playing into your hands, from sheer ignorance of your hand, which he thinks he quite understands—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> nevertheless it is a sort of Entomological paper I am glad to see in the Transactions.</p>
<p>I was too late to send the London journal of Botany with Bonafuss on Thursday, I am trying to find a copy of vol VII. for Linn. Soc.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> They have put me on council of R.S. “heu me miserum!”<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; with Owen too, for my sins.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I wish you would come up on Monday &amp; substitute Falconer’s<ref target="#foot.f11"/> name for his!— There is a talk about organising an opposition to his election, but I suppose it will come to nothing.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>By the way I see you are alluded to in no less than 3 of the papers in Linn. Trans!—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I do not think you are conceited, but really I do think you have a good right to be so. I have said nothing of your writing but what I verily think &amp; believe, &amp; I find people are fast coming round to my way of thinking.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p><hi rend="doubleUnderline">Nov 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> </hi> | I send letter written 4 days ago<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>I have no recollection of applying N.S. to Polynesians, though I dare say I have alluded to so obvious a deduction— none but a German would dig out such a passage &amp; attach importance to it (<hi rend="underline">if it exists in print</hi>)<ref target="#foot.f16"/>   The idea is of course not new to the future author of ‘“The Aristocracy,” or Darwin in all in all.’<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>I have caused Tyndall to modify extensively his pseudo geology, but do not know to what extent— He is awfully wrong about Valleys.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>I have not seen D of Argylls review— he did not understand it the <hi rend="underline">least little bit</hi> about Orchids when I saw him nor understand fully the Origin.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> I shall hunt up a clue I have to his proceedings   I do know something of the origin of his book on Church matters at time of Scotch disruption.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>Would you like our dried strawberries   we have all the wild forms from insular localities &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f21"/> Oliver reminds me of curious remark on sexualism of strawberries by an American, he says it is alluded to at length in Technologist.<ref target="#foot.f22"/> He also tells me to call your attention to 2 states of <hi rend="underline">Epilobium angustifolium</hi> <ref target="#foot.f23"/></p>
<p>I am ashamed of so long neglecting Oxalis sensitiva   I have a plant for you but this is worst season.<ref target="#foot.f24"/></p>
<p>Our <hi rend="underline">admirable</hi> (perfect) governess is so ill with Lungs, that we must part with her, &amp; she has no home poor thing—<ref target="#foot.f25"/> My wife is in pack of troubles, I take her today to get tooth pulled, a worse affair for me than for her! for she behaves <hi rend="underline">shockingly</hi> ill; &amp; I am afraid to have her chloroformed   indeed I doubt if dentist will do it—as I must tell him her heart action is not what it should be.<ref target="#foot.f26"/></p>

A great number of insects are modified in one direction by a seaside habitat. I found, also, the general colours of many widely different species affected in a uniform way in the interior of the South American continent. </quote> In his <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Henry Walter Bates of 13 November 1862</ref>, which is reproduced in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1892</ref>, pp. xlvi–xlvii, Hooker stated that he could not see how Bates applied ‘<hi rend="italic">physical conditions</hi> here, <hi rend="italic">logically</hi>, as a cause different in kind and operation from <hi rend="italic">natural conditions</hi> elsewhere.’ If the ‘physical conditions’ of the sea caused species change, Hooker argued, they could only do so by natural selection rather than by direct action, and were thus identical to ‘natural conditions’. CD, Bates, and Hooker had corresponded on this subject earlier in the year (see letters from J. D. Hooker, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3469.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[10 March 1862]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3474.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">17 March 1862</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3480.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[23 March 1862]</ref>, and letters to J. D. Hooker, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3472.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">14 March [1862]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3479.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">18 March [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3484.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">26 [March 1862]</ref>).</note>

In his paper, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3459.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Andrew Murray</ref> discussed the Coleoptera of Old Calabar in Africa, in the light of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1680.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Forbes’s</ref> theory that the South American continent was ‘at one time united or in close proximity to Western Africa’, a view that Murray tentatively supported. Hooker refers particularly to the following statement of Murray’s (p. 453): <quote type="quote"> I am willing to assume for the present that Europe and North America have been at some period united, and that the affinity between <hi rend="italic">Anophthalmus Bilimekii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. Tellkampfii</hi> may be explained, on Mr. Darwin’s theory, by assuming them to be the product of the same or of allied <hi rend="italic">Trechi</hi> which have wandered into the caves, and that the like conditions have impressed a like form on their offspring. This latter assumption is of course not Mr. Darwin’s; for he repudiates the idea of physical conditions making much, if any, impress upon life. I confess I am still a believer in that exploded heresy. I can see no other way of explaining the existence of these allied blind insects in caves so widely separated; and if it applies to the caves, it may equally apply to any district with well marked physical conditions. </quote> CD lightly annotated his copy of the paper (see n. 5, above), including in his manuscript index for this number of the journal the comment: ‘[p.] 455   Distribution of Beetles’.</note>
