<p>Not the slightest inconvenience was caused by your keeping Richardson,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I assure you,— Had I wished to look at it—I would have written but it is not in my line.</p>
<p>The work you ask about is going on steadily—though not on a railroad— I am rather old fashioned in habits as well as ideas—Ergo—a slow coach.</p>
<p>I am happy to say that there is nothing whatever in your <hi rend="underline">excellent </hi> and <hi rend="underline">well-filled</hi> volume, to which I have any kind of objection to offer—therefore I trust that you will entertain no further Scruple on that Subject.</p>
<p>I have sealed up the copy sent to me by your Printer and will forward it to Capt. B. Hall with King’s.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>If M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Whewell’s notice of your work is published—I should feel obliged by your letting me know where I can see it— I mean his Speech at the Geological Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. <ref target="#foot.f3"/> A line by twopenny is the readiest way—</p>
<p>Sincerely yours | Rob<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. FitzRoy</p>
<p>PS. As my boy has to go near G<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Marlbro’ Street he may as well take this note—and, if you are at home—, wait for an answer about M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Whewell’s Speech.</p>
<p>I have this moment had an application from poor Earle—who—it seems—has been somewhat overthrown by the New Zealand Association—or at least disappointed in his <hi rend="underline">own </hi> Expectations.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>

The disparagement of the work of missionaries by Earle and others stirred FitzRoy and CD to come to their defence in ‘A letter, containing remarks on the moral state of Tahiti, New Zealand, &amp;c.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 1: 19–38). In 1838, a set of Earle’s paintings of New Zealand (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2240.xml">Earle 1838</ref>) was published under the auspices of the New Zealand Association. A prospectus (1837) had announced that there would be a series of such publications, sponsored by the association, but Earle’s was the only part published (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5771.xml">Murray-Oliver 1968</ref>, p. 26).</note>
