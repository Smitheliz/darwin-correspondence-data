<p>I am extremely much obliged to you for your very kind interest regarding me &amp; my curative processes.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am rather glad to hear that people can be injured by the Water cure; for I have rather feared that I was getting inured to it.— I had, however, heard quite enough to have even prevented me, treating myself blindly without guidance: I report myself regularly to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gully &amp; receive instructions. My treatment varies every 4 or 6 weeks— About 8 weeks since I left off the Lamp<ref target="#foot.f2"/> for a month: on an average I have had it throughout the last 9 months from 2 to 4 times a week &amp; so with Douche.— For present fortnight I am having Douche daily, which is first time since leaving Malvern. Having gained weight ever since I commenced,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> is a clear sign that I have not overdosed myself.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gully has had plenty of experience &amp; with me has always been cautious.— He now rather wants to see me; but I hate the trouble of travelling.</p>
<p>If you are led to converse with your D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>., I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to hear his opinion; but I conceive it is simply impossible for anyone to say how much an unknown person can stand; &amp; one must be under the orders of one Doctor. I have lately been <hi rend="underline">very</hi> well; but previously I had a somewhat retrograde period of 6 weeks—though even then <hi rend="underline">infinitely</hi> better than before I commenced the W. Cure.—</p>
<p>We are <hi rend="underline">all</hi> well &amp; flourishing— I am sorry to hear about Chloroform; from what D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Simpson says I believe in such cases as you mention; the frightened &amp; generally prejudiced doctors do not give enough.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I saw a few weeks since Sir P. Egerton<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; he gave me such an account of your Farm, as one of the seven Wonders of the world<ref target="#foot.f6"/> —&amp; delighted I was to hear all he said regarding you &amp; your Farm—</p>
<p>Ever Yours | C. Darwin</p>
