        <abstract>
            <p>Argues the antiquity of the human species because natural selection acts differently with respect to men. Changes in man are largely confined to head and brain. Warfare and sex are very uncertain as means of selection.</p>
            <p>Gives CD complete credit for theory of natural selection.</p>
            <p>Is beginning his narrative of his travels.</p>
            <p>Lyell argues against tracing man as far back as Miocene times. R. I. Murchison’s argument that Africa is the oldest existing land implies that Africa is the place to look for early man.</p>

<p>You are always so ready to appreciate what others do, &amp; especially to over-estimate my desultory efforts, that I can not be surprised at your very kind &amp; flattering remarks on my papers.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am glad however that you have made a few critical observations &amp; am only sorry you were not well enough to make more, as that enables me to say a few words in explanation—</p>
<p>My great fault is haste. An idea strikes me, I think over it for a few days, &amp; then write away with such illustrations as occur to me while going on— I therefore look at the subject almost solely from one point of view. Thus, in my paper on “Man” I aim solely at showing that brutes are modified in a <hi rend="underline">great variety</hi> of ways by “Natural Selection”, but that in <hi rend="underline">none of these particular ways</hi> can man be modified, because of the superiority of his intellect.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I therefore no doubt overlook a few smaller points in which Nat. Selec. may still act on <hi rend="underline">men</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">brutes</hi> alike.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> <hi rend="underline">Colour</hi> is one of them &amp; I have alluded to this in correlation to constitution, in an abstract I have made at Sclater’s request for the Nat. Hist. Review.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> At the same time there is so much evidence of migrations &amp; displacements of races of man, &amp; so many cases of peoples of distinct physical characters inhabiting the same or similar regions, &amp; also of races of uniform physical characters inhabiting widely dissimilar regions,—that the external characteristics of the chief races of man must I think be <hi rend="underline">older</hi> than his present geographical distribution,—&amp; the modifications produced by correlation to favourable variations of constitution be only a secondary cause of external modification— I hope you may get the returns from the Army.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> They would be very interesting, but I do not expect the results would be favourable to your view.</p>
<p>With regard to the constant battles of savages leading to selection of physical superiority, I think it would be very imprefect &amp; subject to so many exceptions &amp; irregularities that it could produce no <hi rend="underline">definite</hi> result.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> For instance,—the strongest &amp; bravest men would lead, &amp; expose themselves most, &amp; would therefore be most subject to wounds &amp; death.— And the physical energy which led to any one tribe delighting in war, might lead to its extermination by inducing quarrels with all surrounding tribes &amp; leading them to combine against it. Again superior cunning, stealth &amp; swiftness of foot, or even better weapons would often lead to victory as well as mere physical strength. Moreover this kind of more or less perpetual war goes on among <hi rend="underline">all savage</hi> peoples— It could lead therefore to no differential characters but merely to the keeping up of a certain average standard of bodily &amp; mental health &amp; vigour. So with selection of variations adapted to special habits of life as fishing, paddling, riding, climbing &amp;c. &amp;c. in different races, no doubt it must act to some extent, but will it be ever so <hi rend="underline">rigid</hi> as to induce a definite physical modification, &amp; can we imagine it to have had any part in producing the distinct races that now exist?<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>The sexual selection you allude to will also I think have been equally uncertain in its results—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> In the very lowest tribes there is rarely much polygamy &amp; women are more or less a matter of purchase— There is also little difference of social condition &amp; I think it rarely happens that any healthy &amp; un-deformed man remains without wife &amp; children.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I very much doubt the often repeated assertion that our aristocracy are more beautiful than the middle classes.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I allow that they present <hi rend="underline">specimens</hi> of the highest kind of beauty, but I doubt the <hi rend="underline">average</hi>.</p>
<p>I have noticed in country places a greater average amount of good looks among the middle classes, &amp; besides we unavoidably combine in our idea of beauty, intellectual expression &amp; refinement of <hi rend="underline">manners</hi>, which often make the less appear the more beautiful. Mere physical beauty,—that is, a healthy &amp; regular development of the body &amp; features approaching to the <hi rend="underline">mean</hi> or <hi rend="underline">type</hi> of European man,—I believe is quite as frequent in one class of society as the other &amp; much more frequent in rural districts than in cities.</p>
<p>With regard to the rank of man in Zoological Classification, I fear I have not made myself intelligible. I never meant to adopt Owen’s or any other such views—but only to point out that from <hi rend="underline">one point</hi> of view he was right— I hold that a distinct <hi rend="underline">family</hi> for Man, as Huxley allows, is all that can possibly be given him <hi rend="underline">Zoologically</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> But at the same time if my theory is <hi rend="underline">true</hi>,—that while the animals which surrounded him have been undergoing modification in <hi rend="underline">all</hi> parts of their bodies to a <hi rend="underline">generic</hi> or even <hi rend="underline">family</hi> degree of difference, he has been changing almost wholly in the brain &amp; head,—then, in geological antiquity the <hi rend="underline">species</hi> man may be as old as many mammalian <hi rend="underline">families</hi>,—&amp; the origin of the <hi rend="underline">family</hi> man may date back to a period when some of the <hi rend="underline">orders</hi> first originated—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>As to the theory of “<hi rend="underline">Natural Selection</hi>” itself, I shall always maintain it to be actually yours &amp; your’s only.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> You had worked it out in details I had never thought of, years before I had a ray of light on the subject, &amp; my paper would never have convinced anybody or been noticed as more than an ingenious speculation, whereas your book has revolutionized the study of Natural History, &amp; carried away captive the best men of the present Age.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> All the merit I claim is the having been the means of inducing <hi rend="underline">you</hi> to write &amp; publish at once.</p>
<p>I may possibly some day go a little more into this subject (of “Man”) &amp; if I do will accept the kind offer of your notes.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>I am now however beginning to write the “Narrative of my travels” which will occupy me a long time as I hate writing narrative, &amp; after Bates’ brilliant success rather fear to fail.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>I shall introduce a few chapters on Geog. Distribution &amp; other such topics.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> Sir C. Lyell while agreeing with my main argument on “man”, thinks I am wrong in wanting to put him back into <hi rend="underline">Miocene</hi> times, &amp; thinks I do not appreciate the immense interval even to the <hi rend="underline">later Pliocene</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> But I still maintain my view, which in fact is a logical result of my theory; for if <hi rend="underline">man originated</hi> in later Pliocene when almost all mammalia were of closely allied species to those now living &amp; many even identical,—then man has <hi rend="underline">not</hi> been stationary in bodily structure while animals have been varying, &amp; my theory will be proved to be all wrong.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>In Murchison’s address to the Geographical Soc. just delivered he points out Africa as being the <hi rend="underline">oldest</hi> existing land. He says there is <hi rend="underline">no</hi> evidence of its having been ever submerged during the tertiary epoch. Here then is evidently the place to find <hi rend="underline">Early man</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f21"/> I hope something good may be found in Borneo &amp; that then means may be found to explore the still more promising regions of tropical Africa,<ref target="#foot.f22"/> for we can expect nothing of man <hi rend="underline">very</hi> early in Europe.</p>
<p>It has given me great pleasure to find that there are symptoms of improvement in your health. I hope you will not exert yourself too soon or write more than is quite agreeable to you.</p>
<p>I think I made out every word of your letter though it was not always easy.</p>

In Wallace 1864c, p. 335, Wallace qualified his statements in Wallace 1864b, writing that he thought there was something to be said for making humans an order, class, or sub-kingdom; ‘though in a true zoological classification’ humans could not be ranked higher than a family. Wallace 1864c ended (p. 336) with Wallace’s statement that his theory ‘harmonised’ Owen’s ‘two main facts’: the singularity of the human brain, and the anatomical similarities between humans and the anthropoid apes.</note>
