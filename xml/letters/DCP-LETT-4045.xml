        <abstract>
            <p>Sends two [unidentified] papers on inheritance of medical malformations. Suggests that besides the inheritance of specific variations, the tendency to show variations in the same organ system (stomach, nervous, etc.) may also be inherited.</p>

<p>I send you, by this same post, a pamphlet with an account of an interesting case of malformations associated &amp; inherited—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I ought not to have forgotten it when you asked me about such cases—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>And I enclose a paper which I turned-up a few days ago,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> and which may serve as an illustration of a class of facts which one meets with in practice among diseases, and which probably have their parallels among ‘malformations’ and other varieties of form:—namely, that the members of one family are not so likely to have, all, the same disease as to have different diseases more or less nearly related to one another— In one family, as in this, are various diseases of the nervous system: in another, of the skin; in another, of the stomach &amp; so on.— Since one might expect, as a general rule, that a progenitor having any well marked variety of form would have offspring in some of whom the same form would appear, but none of whom would present a variety of forms related to, yet different from, that which was peculiar in the progenitor— I do not know if this can suggest to you anything about related groups of forms; but I shall not have wasted much of your time even if all this is not worth consideration.</p>
<p>Of course, the sentence you forwarded to me was all right.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Always truly your’s | James Paget <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
