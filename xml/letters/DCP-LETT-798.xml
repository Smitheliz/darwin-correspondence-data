<p>Darwin’s notes arising from conversations with Joseph Dalton Hooker</p>
<p>Dec. 8.— 1844. J. d. Hooker. Notes<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Maccormick<ref target="#foot.f2"/> says there are blocks of granite &amp;c on Kerguelan land— Icebergs certainly stranded—not known to do so on Auckland Islands. or S. of New Zealand.</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>An astelia, <hi rend="underline">Beech</hi>, (N.B the Astelia of Sandwich Is<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> very different) &amp; Oriobolus (<hi rend="underline">peculiar</hi> genus of grass) common to Mountains of Van Diemen’s land, New Zealand &amp; Tierra del Fuego; H thinks other analogous facts—so that the S. Hemisphere is like north in some community. ==He mentioned another genus==</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>In Falklands there is a peculiar grass common to Melville Isl<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> &amp; same identical grass in Upper Peru.</p>
<p>The 14 Plants (&amp; 4 peculiar) common to Kerguelen Land &amp; T: del Fuego, chiefly grasses &amp; insignificant plants<ref target="#foot.f3"/> —one Auckland Island form there.</p>
<p>Hooker<ref target="#foot.f4"/> <hi rend="underline">thinks</hi>, that There is some affinity between St. Helena &amp; J. Fernandez (!!)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> in two peculiar species of Campanulaciæ; &amp; relations to external conditions in strong caulescent Plumbagos</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Hooker says there is case of foreign Leguminous plant, having been <hi rend="doubleUnderline">reared</hi> from seed picked up on coast of Ireland.—</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Cocos Is<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> (N. of Galapagos) has Mexican form of ferns— Galapagos allied to W. Indian Islands—, certainly American character flora, more than to continent.—</p>
<p>A Rhododendron on summit of Ceylon &amp; Java— An Andromeda summit of Sandwich Is<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.— Believe Europæan form on Organ Mountains in Brazil— Schonburgk<ref target="#foot.f6"/> found Rubi on 6000 ft mountains in Guyana.— What is Flora of Bourbon?<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Really all mountains, except of <hi rend="underline">Australia</hi> (a)<ref target="#foot.f8"/> are allied. (My views require much correcting).<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Iceland 400 plants all Europæan; believes Greenland 600 plants are also so.— <hi rend="underline">Heaths</hi>, but none have crossed Baffins Bay.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Have all these been received from Europe by migration. Good case of evidence for migration.</p>
<p>(a) On Van Diemens Land Mountains, An Anemone &amp; Andromeda, &amp; none of these genera on low-land. (The Andromeda very wonderful, because belong to Ericeæ, &amp; these are represented by Epacridæ.)<ref target="#foot.f11"/> One Rubus, likens it to Arcticus—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> one lowland species. There is allied Anemone in T. del Fuego.— On New Zealand Mountains a herbaceous Veronica, (&amp; Epilobiums?) in lowlands only shrubby ones, almost other genus.— Believe that on most mountains as Ceylon &amp; E. India, the extra-tropical division of grasses are found. Certainly appears as if all mountains in some degree uniform.— Certainly the Gentianæ are Alpine plants, though some are found in lowlands in most countries—yet great tendency to be on mountains. (All my reasoning will apply to sub-alpine Floras.)<ref target="#foot.f13"/> One species found on mountains of <hi rend="underline">Chile</hi>, N. America &amp; Europe. important like the grass, showing a high-Road. The further south gone, on the islands S of New Zealand, the more American Flora becomes. Kerguelen Land not <hi rend="doubleUnderline">so</hi> distant in straght line from T. del Fuego</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Thinks Australia &amp; C. of Good Hope rather more allied than S. America &amp; Australia:—same main divisions as with Mammifers:<ref target="#foot.f14"/> except w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> include all South-part of N. America, &amp; does not know about Madagascar.— {St. Helena versus the world would perhaps be the first division.}</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Agrees with me about diffusion of species.</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Accounts for difference between East &amp; West Australia from plants being “confined” genera, hence the species have “confined ranges”—</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Agrees with Lesson that going to Westward in Pacific, more nutmegs Pandini &amp;c showing more Indian Flora, that it dies away to Eastward &amp; does not get any American character.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Senecio is a large mundane genus, yet no species has a very wide range. Berkely<ref target="#foot.f16"/> says most mundane Fungus has some species with most wide range.</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>I see our cow, which has two abortive mammæ, then these two are unequally developed.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>Hooker’s case of Polypodium fine case of species varying in one country &amp; not in another.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Australian Orchideous Plant. Pterostylos, which from Spring in Labellum, when touched must exclude insect agency, though possibly, I think, an insect might get crushed between</p>
<p>H. has capital plan of testing number of species by seeing how many species he collected in same time, in two countries. In New Zealand, though looking so much more fertile he got only half as many as near Sydney. At Cape he thinks perhaps even more.</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Juan Fernandez. quite S. American Flora—some peculiar genera; many peculiar species of Chilian genera, &amp; some Chilian species— Analogy with St. Helena; such analogy opposed to my views</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>No facts, in Embryology, in Botany: cannot say, which is highest group—most complicated. There is an orchis (Listera ‘avis-nidi??) colourless leafless, &amp;c presenting strong analogy with Orobanche</p>
<p>Hooker says, an Impatiens fulva or biflora, he has no doubt is American &amp; has recently overrun Europe &amp; England &amp; taken place of other plants— Railway Cutting.—introduced in A.D not given in Loudon (lately)<ref target="#foot.f19"/> One species <hi rend="underline">is</hi> doubtful English; but not this large I. fulva<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>I compared Maer Heath, unaltered, during 20,000 years. w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> perhaps not receive new plants—but plant firs &amp; so alter conditions &amp; see how many new things are introduced: so with a whole country.—<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>Are not New Zealand leaves related to present Flora of Van Diemen’s Land?— V. my volcanic volume. Hooker thinks that they are certainly Eucalypti——<ref target="#foot.f22"/> The silicified wood there is <hi rend="underline">Araucaria</hi>..— The fossil trees of Kerguelen Land, probably coeval with the odd Cabbage.—</p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Does not agree, (but had not thought) of Waterhouses remark on alliances being general &amp; not especial<ref target="#foot.f23"/></p>
<p>——————</p>
<p>Believe part, which is normally in a species <hi rend="underline">abortive</hi> appears often as a <hi rend="underline">rudiment</hi>— Has lately seen &amp; described this in case of pistil of dio+ecious <hi rend="underline">Umbelliferous plant</hi>:<ref target="#foot.f24"/> does not know anything on Bentham’s law of variability of abortive parts.——<ref target="#foot.f25"/></p>
