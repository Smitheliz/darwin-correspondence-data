<p>I have received your two notes &amp; the box— I am very sorry that you have had all this trouble in vain—but I trust it will not damp your geological zeal. Depend on it, everyone makes plenty of blunders at first &amp; I well know that I have done so—&amp; so long that they are not printed &amp; published, it signifies nothing— I have seen concretionary bodies something like those sent— There is often a tendency in iron concretions to form hollow spheres &amp; your bodies are to a certain extent a much modified instance of the same tendency<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Allow me to suggest to you not to be in a hurry in sending off any fossils which you may collect as your specimens will be useful to you for comparison in case you find any second lot but any thing which you may wish to send home I will willingly do my best with &amp; place in the hands of those best qualified to appreciate them &amp; describe them.— I sincerely hope that you may meet with success &amp; find interest in your geological pursuits— If you have <hi rend="underline">not</hi> procured the Admiralty Manual of Scientific enquiry<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; would like to possess a copy, I have a spare one &amp; should have much pleasure in sending it you in a few days per the Delivery Company</p>
<p>You have indeed been very scrupulous in not putting me to any charge &amp; as you would perhaps dislike my returning you the stamps I have cut off 12 the amount of the porterage from Farnborough for which I am much obliged</p>
<p>Believe me Dear Sir | with every good wish | Your very faithfull | C. Darwin</p>
