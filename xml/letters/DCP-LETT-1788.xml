                <div type="transcription">
<p>I must have the pleasure of thanking you for your very kind reception of me, &amp; <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the to me really most valuable information, which you gave me. I can assure you it is a long time since I have passed so interesting a morning. But I have, also, an interested motive in writing viz to beg one or two little favours of you; one is to measure for me the length of the upper &amp; lower canine teeth in that very curious skull of the cat: I had intended doing whilst with you, but the amount of interesting talk made me quite forget. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to know the length of the white portion, which was uncovered by the gum, &amp; if the tooth is loose in skull the entire length of the tooth &amp; fang.— What coloured cat was it? &amp; was it very large? All fish come to my net in regard to variation, &amp; I never remember hearing of such a case before. Perhaps your shortest way would be to prick me the length with a pair of compasses, &amp; then I could measure the length carefully to the 1100<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of an inch.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>After being with you I went and ordered some pigeons &amp; brought home two curious Ducks, the hook-billed &amp; tufted.—</p>
<p>I have been thinking that it will give you as you live in country<ref target="#foot.f3"/> much trouble, to send me the less rare breeds of Fowls, &amp; I could get them by payment at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bakers,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but not quite such good birds, as I have no doubt I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have got from you. But do you think you could aid me in a few of the rarer breeds: would it be asking too great a favour to get you to supplicate the owner of those wonderful black Turkish Fowls at Anerly Show<ref target="#foot.f5"/> to take the trouble to send the cock, or even Hen (sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> one die) to me, addressed “to care of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Acton Post Office Bromley Kent.”— And likewise is it in your power to get me a <hi rend="underline">horned</hi> Azores Cock? In the course of a year or two some other rare breeds you might possibly hear of, &amp; it would be of the <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi> use to me to have the carcases.— You seem so very goodnatured that I think that you will forgive all the many favours which I have asked.</p>
<p>Believe me with very sincere thanks. My dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>When you catch your splendid Victoria Runts, please not forget to look at first flight feather.—</p>
<p>I presume the <hi rend="underline">fresh</hi> head of Poland was the <hi rend="underline">white</hi> Poland, &amp; can you remember whether the prepared skull, on which I marked with pencil (H.) to show it was a Hen, &amp; which you gave me, was, also, a White Poland?—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I saw &amp; heard so much new to me that my head was quite confused.</p>
