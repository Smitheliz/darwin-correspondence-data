<p>Very many thanks for your extremely kind note of the 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.— You will perhaps have expected to have heard from me before, but I have been in London for some days to see for the first time the Exhibition, &amp; I fully intended to have proposed a visit to you, but I had from heat &amp; fatigue so many bad headaches, that my plans were entirely deranged &amp; I failed in finding time to visit &amp; thank you in person.—</p>
<p>I now return you your scissors;<ref target="#foot.f1"/> but will you believe it, though I explained with the utmost care to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Weiss, that your scissors were brought only as models, I see they have polished them! &amp; I daresay tried to sharpen them!!! I sincerely hope they cannot have injured them. I found one pair which Weiss had formerly made for me was of same size &amp;c as yours, so I did not get a new pair. I think your model has done some good, for they have reground the old pair &amp; they appear certainly sharper, but I have not yet tried them: if blunt I will try my hand according to your instructions, with oil on the Hone.—</p>
<p>I will remember your wish, &amp; send a copy of my vol: to the Linn: Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. <ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am much obliged for your kind message to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lubbock, which I will not fail to give: he is a remarkably aimable pleasant young man, &amp; has a strong taste for dissecting insects. A little conversation with you, would, I think, be of great service to him; but he is not likely just at present to be staying in London.</p>
<p>I hope much myself to accept your offer &amp; pay you a visit, but I very seldom now go to London, for it always makes me unwell, &amp; I never get half my commissions executed.</p>
<p>With very sincere thanks &amp; hopes that your scissors will not be much the worse from M<hi rend="superscript">rss</hi>. Weiss taking them so stupidly in hand, believe me | My dear Sir | Yours sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
