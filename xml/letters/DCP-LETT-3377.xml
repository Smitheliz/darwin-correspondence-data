<p>I have now finished the rough draught of 5 chapters of my book &amp; send you by this post the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> for perusal according to your kind offer to do so. I do not know how I shall repay you for all this.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Your suggestions on 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> chapter shall be all carried out.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Your good opinion has delighted my Father &amp; Brother as well as myself.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The recommendation to alter the <hi rend="underline">arrangement</hi> 〈    〉 putting the historical sketch last is just the kind of correction that I feel most to need.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> As to your statement that the argument on the effects of climate on dress is original &amp; you are certainly too generous:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I find there is something to the same effect in your “Journal”, (popular ed. p 381)<ref target="#foot.f6"/> as my notions were suggested whilst on the Amazons the two conclusions have been derived independently &amp; therefore my remarks will be interesting; but I must quote your passage in a note.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>〈    〉 loose statement of the rocks being cretacean is der〈ived〉 from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wallace’s book;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> No 〈fossil〉 was found &amp; therefore it is useless to employ the word. I shall feel obliged to introduce a little Geology—so much as I observed which contributes to explain the <hi rend="underline">latest changes</hi> &amp; therefore connects itself with Geograph. Distribution of the Fauna. I must consult some Geologist before I do it.— One of my little theories is that part of the Delta of the Amazons was land probably an island whilst most of the Alluvial plain was under water; &amp; that the Amazon waters have broken through it. I shall be careful however not to advance too much in the book.</p>
<p>As to explaining the “We” 〈you〉r remark shows me that there must 〈be so〉mething very abrupt &amp; unsatisfactory in my commencement! I will add a straight forward preface 〈e〉xplaining the object of journey of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 〈W〉allace &amp; self &amp;c &amp;c.—or would you incorporate the explanation in the text of 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> chapter.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Please criticize this 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> chapter without reserve. I am not satisfied with the arrangement of the matter nor with the argument on the text of Burmeister’s remarks.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> But I know you will be candid with me as before.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Bates was writing an account of his travels in the Amazon region, undertaken between 1848 and 1859. CD had encouraged Bates to publish an account and had offered to read the ‘1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Chapter or two’ of the manuscript; he repeated his offer to read a second chapter after reading the first in December 1861 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, letters to H. W. Bates, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3109.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">4 April [1861]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3266.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">25 September [1861]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3338.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">3 December [1861]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3345.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">15 December [1861]</ref>). <hi rend="italic">The naturalist on the River Amazons</hi> was published in 1863.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Having read the first manuscript chapter of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, CD made suggestions as to how it might be improved (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3345.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to H. W. Bates, 15 December [1861]</ref>). His main point was that Bates should give the vernacular as well as the scientific names of any British animals mentioned.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Bates’s younger brother, Frederick, had been a keen entomologist since childhood. Their father, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_318.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Henry Bates</ref>, was a hosiery manufacturer in Leicester.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD suggested that Bates place his historical description of the town of Pará, Brazil, at the end of the first chapter (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3345.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to H. W. Bates, 15 December [1861]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3345.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to H. W. Bates, 15 December [1861]</ref> and n. 2. In his first chapter, Bates argued against the widespread belief that the birds and insects of the tropics were generally larger and more beautiful than those in temperate zones. From this, and from the fact that it is usually only the males of a species that display ‘brilliant dress’, he concluded that, contrary to popular opinion, climate had ‘little or no direct influence in the matter’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 18–23).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Bates refers to the second edition of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4250.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Journal of researches</hi></ref>, which was issued as part of John Murray’s Colonial and Home Library series. The passage Bates cites (p. 381) discusses the generally dull coloration of the birds, plants, and insects of the Galápagos islands compared with the brilliantly coloured products of other equatorial regions. CD concluded that: <quote type="quote"> the usual gaudy colouring of the intertropical productions, is not related either to the heat or light of those zones, but to some other cause, perhaps to the conditions of existence being generally favourable to life. </quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Bates referred to CD’s conclusions (see n. 6, above) in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 21.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">CD had remarked in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3345.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to H. W. Bates, 15 December [1861]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9) that without good evidence Bates should avoid identifying rocks as ‘Cretaceous’. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8069.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wallace 1853</ref>, pp. 420–1, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4935.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Russel Wallace</ref> discussed his difficulties in elucidating the geology of the Amazon valley, stating: ‘It is remarkable that I was never able to find any fossil remains whatever … We are thus unable to assign the geological age to which any of the various beds of rock belong’. Later in the text, however, Wallace stated (p. 425): ‘The neighbourhood of Pará consists entirely of a coarse iron sandstone, which is probably a continuation of the rocks observed by Mr. Gardner at Maranham and in the Province of Piauhy, and which he considered to belong to the chalk formation’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3345.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to H. W. Bates, 15 December [1861]</ref>. Bates explained in a preface to <hi rend="italic">The naturalist on the River Amazons</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: iii–vi) that the expedition to the river had begun as a joint undertaking with Wallace, ‘for the purpose of exploring the Natural History of its banks’. They had intended, he continued, to ‘gather facts, as Mr. Wallace expressed it …, “towards solving the problem of the origin of species,” a subject on which we had conversed and corresponded much together.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Bates contrasted his positive response to the sense of the ‘vastness of nature’ and the ‘insignificance’ of man, induced by the enormous animal and plant diversity of the tropical forest, with the experience of the German zoologist Karl Hermann Konrad Burmeister, who found the ‘restless selfishness’ of the forest vegetation painful (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 53). Bates gave no citation, but the reference is probably to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1105.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Burmeister 1853</ref>, p. 127.</note>
