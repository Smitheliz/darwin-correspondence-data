<p>When I left Downe I could not find Johnny’s Savings Bank book.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It had been put away with other papers and has only now turned up. Will you be so kind as to have it made up and returned to me.</p>
<p>I hope its absence has not increased the trouble you and the other managers are so kind as to take on behalf of depositors.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am glad to have a reason for writing to you and to be able to wish you and yours a happy Christmas and New year. Stephens has not mentioned you in any very recent letter wherefore I conclude you are all well.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I hope William continues to like his occupation and finds it as golden as he could anticipate.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Henry Lubbock seems to hang on to the paternal nest very firmly at present.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> John must be a great loss to Lady Lubbock but his own party increased too fast to remain with comfort.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am sorry to hear Ring’s wife is so ill.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> She has been a good wife and brought up her children far better than most— I had a very cheerful letter from Knight Bruce a few days ago. He is still without a house and has just returned to his Father’s at Roehampton from Versailles where he has been all the summer.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>We lead a very quiet life here. My wife<ref target="#foot.f10"/> is quite as well as she was in England and has several times gone out to dinner some 4 or 5 miles, which she could not, or would not do at Downe. Our change has been of the greatest advantage to Johnny’s health. He has grown quite stout and robust as well as tall, and has not had an hour’s illness, indeed I am thankful to say that we have had no need for a doctor in the house since we have been here. We want a cook very badly but it is not much use to ask you as I don’t think they grow abundantly in your soil. There is no special natural history that has come under my unscientific observation, except that I saw a white rabbit with black tips to his ears on a muir where only brown and occasionally a black one commonly dwell. What do you say to wheat being grown from oats in the second year? Do you trust it enough to try it for yourself?<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
