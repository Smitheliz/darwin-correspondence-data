<p>This will be handed you by my friend John Blunt Esqe of this city, who I beg leave to recommend to your acquaintance<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Mr Blunt has kindly offered to hand over to you a copy of the last geological report made under the authority of of the state of Newyork.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is less ample than the previous reports of progress which have been made in the course of the survey, and will probably be succeeded in the course of next year by the full and final report.</p>
<p>The late meeting of the Association of American geologists held at Philadelphia on the first week in April was attended with a fine spirit and feelings of deep interest on the part of its members. Some expectation had been indulged by gentlemen engaged in the surveys of our extensive Silurian formations, of meeting with Mr Murchison on this occasion.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I venture to send you also a few copies of my short paper on the tornado which passed across the State of New Jersey in June 1835; being nearly the same as published in the January number of the Lond. and Ed. Phil. Magazine.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> As this tornado was, by experienced seamen who saw it pronounced to be a veritable <hi rend="underline">water spout</hi>, I have thought that a set of determinate observations upon its whirling action might not be unacceptable to some of your naval or scientific friends. I have on hand several other cases of this kind which have not been printed.</p>
<p>I am dear sir very respectfully yours | W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. C. Redfield</p>
