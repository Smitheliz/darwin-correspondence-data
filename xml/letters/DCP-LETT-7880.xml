<p>I am much obliged for your long &amp; interesting letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You ask me whether I have any notion about the meaning of moths &amp;c flying into candles, &amp; birds against light-houses.— I have not.— I have looked at the case as one of curiosity, which is very strong with the higher animals, &amp; I presume even with insects.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> A light is a very new object, &amp; its distance cannot be judged, but how it comes that an insect is so stupid as to go on flying into the same candle I cannot conceive. It looks as if they were drawn towards it.— Sir C. Lyell, I remember, made years ago the difficulty greater by asking me, what stops all the moths in the world flying every moon-light night up to the moon, or as near as they could get.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Perhaps they have instinctively learnt that this cannot be done.—</p>
<p>With respect to humour, I think dogs do have it, but it is necessarily only of a practical kind. Everyone must have seen a dog with a piece of a stick or other object in his mouth, &amp; if his master in play tries to take it away, the dog runs with prancing steps a few yards away, squats down, facing his master, &amp; waits till he comes <hi rend="underline">quite close</hi> &amp; then jumps up &amp; repeats the operation,—looking, as if he said, “you are sold”.—</p>
<p>I have many letters to write so pray excuse brevity.— My book has been very successful as far as sale has been concerned, &amp; has hitherto been in most cases treated very liberally by the press.—.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> My notions on the moral sense have, however, been much reprobated by some &amp; highly praised by others.— I have no news to tell, for I have seen hardly any one for months.—</p>
<p>I am extremely sorry to hear that you are no freer of official duties, for I feel sure if you had more leisure &amp; especially if you lived in the country, you would make some grand new observations.—</p>
<p>With every good wish— Pray believe me | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
