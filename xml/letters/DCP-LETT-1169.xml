<p>As you were so kind as to suggest my writing to you on the point referred to in your Address, I will begin seriatim with the Barrier reefs— At p. 49 of my Volume on Coral Reefs, (please read whole page) you will see the reasons, why I do not think it probable that these reefs grow on the submarine margin of the denuded coast-land.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>With respect to atoll-like reefs being thus formed, I here remarked (p. 101) that if a bank either of rock or hardened sediment “lay a few fathoms submerged, the simple growth of the coral, <hi rend="underline">without the aid of subsidence</hi>, would produce a structure scarcely 〈    〉 true atoll;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> for in all cases 〈    〉<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Again at p. 57 (&amp; elsewhere, as at p. 89) I have sai〈d〉 〈    〉 origin just mentioned “sometimes 〈    〉 <hi rend="underline">should not be overlooked</hi>) the appea〈  〉 differ from them &amp;c &amp;c.”<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>The Red Sea is the only instance where there is evidence that worn down islands have been coated by coral-reefs; &amp; here the coating begins as soon as ever the surface gets under water; such, I believe, would be the usual occurrence, &amp; accordingly I have endeavoured to show at p. 93 that atolls cannot have been thus formed. If it be supposed that the islands are worn down to a depth of 20 or 30 fathoms, before the corals become attached to them; then we have the case proposed by Chamisso,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> against which I have urged some considerations at p. 89. That I had the special case of worn-down craters in my mind, you will see in the note to p. 94; but I really thought it superfluous to argue <hi rend="underline">separately</hi> against worn-down craters, or islands of other rocks, or upraised coral-reefs, or banks of sediment, but I lumped them together under the term of submarine 〈    〉 repeatedly in my volume endea= 〈    〉 that there may be 〈    〉 atolls &amp; barrier reefs 〈    〉 formed by subsidence; thus at p 89. I state 〈    〉 Chamisso’s view “is inapplicable to the <hi rend="underline">greater number</hi> of atolls”. In same page I have remarked that some atolls may be formed on the crest of a crater (of which case I suspect Rose Is<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> is an instance). I consider my theory as only applicable with any certainty to the groups of atolls; &amp; consequently in my final chapter, I remark (p 124) “The evidence from a single atoll or a single encircling barrier-reef, must be received with some caution, for the former may possibly be based on a submerged crater or <hi rend="underline">bank</hi>, and the latter on a submerged margin of sediment or of worn-down rock.”— Whether you consider my remarks satisfactory or not, I trust that you will find that I have not proceeded without consideration of the sources of error: I assure you, I did not spare time or labour in examining thousands of charts &amp; all voyages.— But forgive the length of this letter; a man is as tender of his theories as of his child〈ren〉 &amp; values one &amp; the other at a hundred 〈    〉</p>
<p>Y〈  〉 <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> To | Sir H. Delabeche</p>
<p>If you are interested on this subject; pray look at the great charts of of E. Indian Company of the Maldiva islands: my reduced copy of Mahlos Madoo is quite insufficient to show their truly wonderful structure. The reefs in the extreme west part of the W. Indian archipelago, are the greatest puzzlers to me.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>

The point in question was whether, as Jukes contended, atolls might have been formed by the growth of corals on the foundations of sediment from denuded coastland without subsidence, or whether subsidence was a necessary condition as CD maintained.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1571.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Coral reefs</hi></ref>, p. 101: ‘would produce a structure scarcely to be distinguished from a true atoll’.</note>
