                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>

<p>I am much obliged by your note. I returned from London on Saturday &amp; I found there your Memoir,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> which I had not received, owing to the Porter having been out when I last sent to the Geolog. Soc.— I have read your Paper with the greatest interest &amp; have been much struck with the novelty &amp; importance of many of your facts. I beg to thank you for the courteous manner in which you combat me, &amp; I plead quite guilty to your rebuke about demonstration.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You have misunderstood my paper in a few points, but I do not doubt that is owing to its being badly &amp; tediously written.</p>
<p>You will, I fear, think me very obstinate when I say that I am not in the least convinced about the Barriers:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> they remain to me as improbable as ever. But the oddest result of your paper on me (&amp; I assure you, as far as I know myself, it is not perversity) is, that I am very much staggered in favour of the ice-lake theory of Agassiz &amp; Buckland;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> until I read your important discovery of the outlet in Glen Glastig<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I never thought this theory at all tenable. Now it appears to me that a very good case can be made in its favour. I am not, however, as yet a believer in the ice-lake theory, but I tremble for the result.</p>
<p>I have had a good deal of talk with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lyell on the subject, &amp; from his advice I am going to send a letter to the Scotsman, in which I give briefly my present impression,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> (though there is not space to argue with you on such points, as I think I could argue) &amp; indicate which points strike me as requiring further investigation with respect, chiefly, to the ice-lake theory, so that you will not care about it. If my letter be inserted I will send you a copy, &amp; with my best thanks for your valuable &amp; most interesting Memoir</p>
<p>I beg to remain | dear Sir | Yours sincerely | C. Darwin <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> D. Milne Esq<hi rend="superscript">e</hi></p>
<p>P.S. | Some facts, mentioned in my Geology of S. America, p. 24, with regard to the shoaling of the deep fiords of T. del Fuego, near their Mouths, &amp; which I have remarked would tend, with a little elevation to convert such fiords into lakes with a great mound-like barrier of detritus at their mouths, might, possibly, have been of use to you, with regard to the lakes of Glen Roy.</p>

CD rejected Milne’s theory because there was no physical evidence that these barriers ever existed, particularly in an area whose features appeared to be entirely preserved.
