            <p>The Darwin family are anxious for FEEW’s and Hensleigh’s opinions of CD’s journal. EW is convinced that Henry Holland is wrong if he thinks it not worth publishing.</p>

                <div type="transcription">
                    <p>I am thinking that it is a long time since I have written to you. We heard several times from the Tollets how Marianne<ref target="#foot.f2"/> was going on, but I was glad to get your letter &amp; to hear that you were not the worse.</p>
                    <p>We are in such a dissipated humour that we have actually invited the Mainwarings &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Moreton for next Wednesday &amp; then we shall be clear of the world for a year to come. I dined there last Tuesday &amp; had some more of the Capts lovely flute playing. There was a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Clark there a clergyman from Eccleshall who played very tolerably but we were not spared a note of Capt M’s notwithstanding. Poor Mrs M. is no longer able to feed herself &amp; I cant think how they can endure her to sit in company to be made a spectacle of with Miss Chawner putting the food into her mouth. I suppose Miss M. does not like to propose her not dining with them.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Eliza<ref target="#foot.f4"/> is now staying with us &amp; I think she is a little better for rest though she is very weak   It is out of the question to hope that she will not be anxious for I never saw any one so much disposed to it. All the rest of Seabridge party are coming in a few days. Jessie recovers her strength very slowly &amp; has only just begun to come down stairs to breakfast &amp; is nervous &amp; often poorly.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I dined with them the other day &amp; she was in very good spirits &amp; enjoys her little scarecrow very much. It is become very tidy to look at now. Allen<ref target="#foot.f6"/> is poorly too &amp; if we leave him at home one evening we are afraid he will be very bad by the next day, not that he comes every day either.</p> 
                    <p>Catherine tells me they are very anxious to have yours &amp; H’s real opinion of Charles’s journal. I am convinced D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Holland is mistaken if he thinks it not worth publishing. I don’t believe he is any judge as to what is amusing or interesting. Cath does not approve of its being mixed up with Capt Fitzroys &amp; wants it to be put altogether by itself in an Appendix<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>I wish Miss Martineau would invite you to meet M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Fanny Butler.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I hope Erasmus<ref target="#foot.f9"/> was there. I am very curious about her. I envy you Mr Scott’s lectures. If he makes you understand the Epistle to the Romans I shall think him a great genius.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> We had a very nice visit from Godfrey. It was pleasant to see how fond he is of his little maid<ref target="#foot.f11"/>   He always saved some dessert or asked for some for her. She appears dull when one is with her but I think she is shy &amp; may be more amusing when nobody is by &amp; she is certainly very good tempered &amp; gentle. His only bon mot was enquiring what papas overalls were &amp; saying “Are they to prevent his hurting his knees when he tumbles down. I began teaching him to read which he did not much like but never rebelled. My Aunts admired him very properly. We enjoyed their visit thoroughly. Uncle Allen was very gay &amp; his conversation amused Mamma very much &amp; brought all sorts of old recollections into her head.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Louisa Holland paid <hi rend="superscript">£</hi> 2"10 for her boa so Hensleigh can pay himself when he has any money affairs.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
                    <p>Hensleigh was taken with a very ill timed fit of prudence about Penelopes speech<ref target="#foot.f14"/> which I want to hear &amp; we will be duly cautious. I am afraid poor Bros<ref target="#foot.f15"/> tantrums are a sign of his not being well. I like his Grace very much. Schloss Hainfeld makes one despise Capt Hall.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> What a conceited egotist he is. Do you remember about the bell rope &amp; pocket handk.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> I like Buckland<ref target="#foot.f18"/> but rather wish I had finished him. Susan<ref target="#foot.f19"/> is coming to Seabridge but not here she says which is naughty of her. Edinburgh is not settled yet as Bessy H. &amp; I keep on telling each other to settle the time. Are the Giffords come yet.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p> 
                   <p>Goodbye my dear Fanny my best love to H. &amp; a kiss to the two.</p>
                    <p>I can’t think what Penelope w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> do if Uncle Baugh offers to go abroad   She will not endure to go with him.<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
