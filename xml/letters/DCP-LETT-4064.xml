<p>I send Athenæum by todays post, which please return. I thought you would like to see the first article!<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I wish I could see any way of “ingenious wriggling” that would remove the crushing evidence in the shape of tropical forms—against tropical cold.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You have no idea of the magnitude of such a case as Dipterocarp<hi rend="doubleUnderline">eæ</hi> in Nat. Ord—not a mere genus, of 10 genera, &amp; 112 species all from Ceylon, the Malayan Peninsula &amp; Islands,—&amp; of which a good 100 more species, &amp; many more genera, are still to come from Borneo, Sumatra &amp;c.— All are woody &amp; for the larger proportion are huge timber trees— not one ascends at all to any height.—&amp; analogous species to living are found in tertiary coal beds of Labuan &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Zingiberaceæ &amp; Marantaceæ are as bad cases in the Herbaceous way &amp; there are many <hi rend="underline">many</hi> others. I shall work out the Cameroon’s case carefully &amp; put the pros &amp; cons in as strong a light as I can— I am very sorry for you, but what can I do or say!—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>A thousand thanks for your explanation about Reversion in which I am sure I shall go the whole hog with you; it is a subject on which I have a huge <hi rend="underline">latent</hi> interest—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am glad you pitched into Lyell about the passage regarding genius,—he will surely think we were in collusion! about his book.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>We went to Lord Dundreary last night &amp; <hi rend="underline">roared</hi>, he is a far more scientific character than I anticipated—not a broad comedy character, but very charming in his fatuity, nonchalance, ignorance, &amp; his incoherent wit:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> for the first time in my life I fell in love with the character of “diverting vagabond”   quite a new sensation—I assure you— he is not a puppy, like Albert Smith <hi rend="underline">was</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Please leave the Medallion any-where in town when you are sending up, &amp; I will send for it.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Ever yours | J D Hooker</p>
<p>I have been awfully dissipated of late—out every night. We think of Weymouth &amp; Guernsey on Thursday with 2 boys<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I wonder if your Willy would like to join us and botanize in Guernsey?— if you think so I will write to him<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>We would cross from Southampton</p>
<p>N B. if the weather is bad we shall not cross, but take a cruise in New forest</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is established by the relationship between this letter and the letters to J. D. Hooker, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4061.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">26 [March 1863]</ref> and from J. D. Hooker, [31 March 1863]; the intervening Saturday was 28 March.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Hooker refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3629.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Owen’s</ref> anonymous review of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1265.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Carpenter 1862</ref>, which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi>, 28 March 1863, pp. 417–19 (for the attribution, see the publisher’s marked copies of the journal at City University Library, London). The review, which is reproduced in Appendix VII, contained comments critical of CD’s account of the origin of life and the origin of species (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4065.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, [29 March 1863]</ref> and nn. 5 and 6).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Hooker refers to CD’s claim that the tropics must have been cool enough during the Pleistocene glacial period for temperate species to have migrated between the northern and southern hemispheres, a claim that Hooker disputed on the grounds that many tropical plants could not have survived in such conditions (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4061.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 26 [March 1863]</ref>). CD’s capacity for ‘ingenious wriggling’ with regard to theoretical difficulties had been a joke between the two friends over a number of years (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3797.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 7 November 1862</ref> and n. 17).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4061.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 26 [March 1863]</ref> and n. 9. Labuan is an island off the north-west coast of Borneo.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In the introduction to his flora of the temperate regions of the Cameroons mountains (J. D. Hooker 1863b, pp. 176–80), Hooker briefly characterised, under itemised headings, the extent of the overlap between the genera and species of the Cameroons mountains and those of various other temperate regions. He noted that the large proportion of plant genera in the Cameroons mountains that were also found in Europe was ‘most singular’, given the ‘total isolation’ of the regions by ‘hot, low deserts’, and he mentioned two hypotheses that could render the phenomenon explicable (p. 181). The first was CD’s theory of migration during a global cold period, and the second was Hooker’s preferred theory of transport by aerial currents and birds; however, Hooker did not clearly state which of the two theories he considered was favoured by the evidence. See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4040.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, [15 March 1863]</ref> and n. 21.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Hooker refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4676.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Tom Taylor’s</ref> comedy, <hi rend="italic">Our American cousin</hi>, which had been running at the Haymarket Theatre, London, since 1861. The main feature of the play was <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4470.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Askew Sothern’s</ref> portrayal of the character Lord Dundreary, an English aristrocrat with a ‘well-bred air married to a vacant stare’, absurd mannerisms, twisted aphorisms, and inane lines. Sothern substantially rewrote the part for himself until it grew into a series of monologues and ‘all but dwarfed the remainder of the play’, creating one of the most celebrated comic parts in nineteenth-century theatre (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7775.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Tolles 1940</ref>, pp. 173–80).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Puppy: ‘a vain, empty-headed, impertinent young man; a fop, a coxcomb’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5936.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">OED</hi></ref>). Between 1850 and 1860, the writer and dramatist <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4394.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Albert Richard Smith</ref> wrote and performed in a number of ‘entertainments’ in London, descriptive of his journeys in Asia (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2063.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>).</note>
