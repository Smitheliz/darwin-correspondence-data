<p>The facts about my uncle’s<ref target="#foot.f2"/> bitch are these.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago he had a bull-terrier bitch. A Captain Arkwright resided here at that time and had a famous Irish bull dog, Jim.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He got a litter of pups off Jim twice. He then wished to have a litter off a very fine rough Scotch terrier. As soon as his bitch began to show signs of being in heat he shut her up and is quite certain that no dog but the Scotch terrier got near her. The bitch had always shown a decided preference for Jim, so much so that even when in heat she would snarl at other dogs that came near her. She was put under lock with the Scotch terrier, and in due time she had her pups. None of them resembled the Scotch terrier but they were all like the bull dog. One was so like that he kept him on that account and he (the pup) was in the village for several years afterwards. The likeness was both in shape &amp; colour.</p>
<p>My uncle has been long a breeder and fancier of dogs, and has always had the conviction that some cause other than copulation produced this remarkable phenomenon.</p>
<p>I am yours | G Thin</p>
