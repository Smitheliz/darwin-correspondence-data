<p>Will you oblige me by looking over the enclosed <hi rend="underline">prospectus.</hi> —<ref target="#foot.f2"/> My publisher has almost entirely altered the one I wrote; perhaps he has improved some parts, but I do not like others.— He has asked me to get some one to read it over.— The sentence written at the bottom, appears to me better than the three short printed ones.— Will you return it with any one of the proofs with any marginal observations on it.—</p>
<p>My journal, I am very glad to be able to tell you is very near its end.— One more chapter, &amp; that not a very long one, will complete the task, which I fear must have been a heavier one, than you could have anticipated.— My journal, I suspect, will not be published for several months,—but it is a great satisfaction to me to feel my hands nearly clear for other work.—</p>
<p>I am going tomorrow morning to the Isle of Wight &amp; shall return on Wednesday night.— I heard yesterday from Fox, who told me he intended paying me a visit, as we have never seen each other since my return.— But as Fox is so delicate a person, I thought it a shame to allow him to travel in this cold weather, so I am going to anticipate him, though just at present I can ill spare the time. I called on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spring Rice, about a fortnight since, to thank him for his very considerate kindness in writing to me himself about the Grant.— As long as he remains in office, I am sure I shall have no trouble from government. He was congratulating himself, that the country m〈igh〉t support <hi rend="underline">even the misfortune</hi> of h〈aving〉 a whig ministry, when they were occasiona〈lly〉 able to do such good acts as give you a living.— I never saw a man look more pleased as he said so.—</p>
<p>I find London at this time of the year, most delightfully tranquil, especially as I never call on anyone.—</p>
<p>Good bye | Most truly y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. | Chas. Darwin</p>
<p>Thank you for doing my servants’ business.— I forwarded Prof. Don’s<ref target="#foot.f3"/> parcel.—</p>

It was issued by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4407.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Smith, Elder &amp; Co</ref>., Cornhill, and announced the Treasury grant, with a list of the collections to be described by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3629.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Owen</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4972.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Robert Waterhouse</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1935.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Gould</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_379.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Bell</ref>, and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2560.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Leonard Jenyns</ref>. Twenty numbers were projected (nineteen were published) to appear on the first day of every alternate month.

See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2661.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Freeman 1977</ref>, p. 26. The date of the printed prospectus cannot be identified with certainty.</note>
