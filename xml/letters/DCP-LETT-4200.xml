<p>It would give me real pleasure to resolve your doubts, but I cannot. I can give only suspicions &amp; my grounds for them. I should think the non-viscidity of the stigmatic hollow was due to the plant not living under its natural conditions.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Please see what I have said on Acropera;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> an excellent observer M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. J. Scott of Bot. Garden Edinburgh finds all that I say accurate, but nothing daunted he with the knife enlarged orifice &amp; forced in pollen-masses; or he simply stuck them into the contracted orifice <hi rend="underline">without coming into contact with the stigmatic surface</hi>, which is hardly at all viscid; when lo &amp; behold pollen-tubes were emitted &amp; fine seed capsules obtained.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> This was effected with Acropera Loddigesii; but I have no doubt that I have blundered badly about A. luteola.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I mention all this because as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott remarks, as the plant is in our Hot-House it is quite incredible it ever could be fertilised in its native land.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The whole case is an utter enigma to me.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Probably you are aware that there are cases (&amp; it is one of the oddest facts in physiology) of plants which under culture have their sexual functions in so strange a condition, that though their pollen &amp; ovules are in sound state &amp; can fertilise &amp; be fertilised by distinct but allied species; they cannot fertilise themselves.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Now M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott has found this the case with certain Orchids, which again shows sexual disturbance. He has read paper at Bot. Soc. of Edinburgh &amp; I daresay an abstract which I have seen will appear in Gard. Chron; but blunders have crept in in copying &amp; parts are barely intelligible.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> How insects act with your Stanhopea, I will not pretend to conjecture. In many cases, I believe the acutest man could not conjecture without seeing the insect at work. I could name common English plants in this predicament.— But the Musk orchis is case in point. Since publishing my son &amp; self have watched the plant &amp; seen the pollinia removed &amp; where do you think they <hi rend="underline">invariably</hi> adhere in dozens of specimens; always to the joint of femur with the trochanter of 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. pair of legs &amp; no where else.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> When one sees such adaptation as this, it would be hopeless to conjecture on the Stanhopea till we know what insect visits it. I have fully proved that my strong suspicion was correct that with many of our English orchids no nectar is excreted, but that insects penetrate the tissues for it.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> So I suspect it must be with many foreign species.</p>
<p>I forgot to say, that if you find you cannot fertilise any of your exotics take pollen from some allied form &amp; it is quite probable that will succeed.—</p>
<p>Will you have the kindness to look occasionally at your Bee Ophrys near Torquay &amp; see whether pollinia are ever removed. It is my greatest puzzle.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Please read what I have said on it &amp; on O. arachnites;<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I have since proved account of latter is correct.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I wish I could have given you better information.</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | If the flowers of the Stanhopea are not too old—remove pollen-masses from their pedicels &amp; stick them with a little liquid pure gum to stigmatic cavity. After the case of the Acropera, no one can dare positively say that they would not act.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In his letter to CD of 30 May 1863, Gosse described the difficulties he had experienced in attempting to pollinate the orchid <hi rend="italic">Stanhopea oculata</hi>, noting in particular that what he assumed to be the stigma was not viscous, so that pollinia would not adhere to it.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD described the floral morphology of the orchid genus <hi rend="italic">Acropera</hi> in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, pp. 204–10, noting that, in the specimens he had seen, the orifice of the stigmatic chamber was so narrow that the pollen-masses could ‘hardly be forced in’ (p. 205). As with Gosse’s <hi rend="italic">Stanhopea</hi>, CD considered the possibility that this may have been due to unnatural conditions, but concluded that his experience of orchids grown in hothouses furnished ‘no reason’ to believe this to be the case (p. 209).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">See, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3800.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 11 November 1862</ref>, and this volume, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3997.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 18 February [1863]</ref>.

CD refers to his conclusion that there was a separation of the sexes in <hi rend="italic">A. luteola</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, pp. 206–9), which he later described as ‘a great error’, Scott’s results having convinced him that the species of this genus were hermaphrodite (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Fertilization of orchids’</ref>, p. 153 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 150)).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Before he concluded that there was separation of the sexes in <hi rend="italic">Acropera</hi>, CD had considered the genus to be the ‘opprobrium’ of his work on the pollination mechanisms of orchids, since all the floral parts ‘seemed determinately contrived that the plant should never be fertilised’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, p. 203). For CD’s subsequent explanation of his observations, see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4255.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Friedrich Hildebrand, 28 July [1863]</ref>, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Fertilization of orchids’</ref>, p. 153 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 150).</note>

CD’s hypothesis was that these plants did produce nectar, but secreted it into the intercellular spaces between the inner and outer membranes of the nectary, an arrangement requiring insects to spend more time in the flower in order to extract the nectar by boring through the inner membrane of the nectary. While staying at Hartfield Grove, Hartfield, Sussex, in May 1863, CD made additional observations of the nectaries of <hi rend="italic">Orchis morio</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Anacamptis morio</hi>, the green-wing orchid) and <hi rend="italic">O. maculata</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Dactylorhiza maculata</hi>, the heath spotted orchid), and of the behaviour of insects visiting the flowers, which confirmed his earlier conclusions (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Fertilization of orchids’</ref>, pp. 142–3 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 140), and the dated observational notes in DAR 70: 176–7).

One of CD’s objectives in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref> was to demonstrate that cross-fertilisation was the ‘main object’ of the ‘contrivances’ by which orchids were pollinated (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, p. 1), noting in his conclusion to the book that <hi rend="italic">O. apifera</hi> was the only species in which he had observed ‘special and perfectly efficient contrivances for self-fertilisation’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, p. 359). CD had carried out extensive but inconclusive observations designed to establish whether the pollinia were ever removed by insects in this species (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, pp. 66–70). Gosse lived at Babbacombe Bay, near Torquay, Devon, where CD had made some of these observations (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, p. 66).</note>
