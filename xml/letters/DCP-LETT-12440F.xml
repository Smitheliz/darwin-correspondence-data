                    <p>I must just drop you a line or two to let you know how we are getting on; though we are so isolated here, and get so little news from England, that I am afraid I must fill my letter by nothing more than our own personal affairs. I send Robertson a short bulletin from time to time, for the information of all friends who have kindly come forward to help us through the winter:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but he tells me he seldom sees you, so I had better let you know occasionally how we prosper, direct. I am glad to say that I am still steadily, though very slowly, gaining health and strength: and I hope when the spring sets in—which it will do here next month—that I shall take a complete turn for the better. Even now, I can walk five miles without the least fatigue, and I have almost entirely lost my cough. I don’t doubt that by next spring I shall be quite well enough to resume work in England, if any should offer. The winter here has been for the most part simply delicious. We had a week’s frost in December, and three days again last week: but with these two exceptions there have been few days when one could not have picnicked in the open air with perfect comfort. For three weeks together in the beginning of January we had perfectly cloudless skies and warm sunlight day after day without intermission: and though the weather is now a little dubious again, we were able yesterday to take out baby,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> and lunch by the seaside in weather like an English July. As a rule, people who come here suffering as I do, do not <hi rend="underline">get better</hi> during December and January, but begin to mend in February: in other words, they simply stand still during the coldest months, and improve as soon as it gets warm again. I therefore look upon the fact that I have been steadily picking up ever since I came here as an indication that Hyères suits me particularly well. The surroundings are extremely pretty, and we find the walks among the hills grow upon one continually, so that we like the place much better the longer we stop in it, especially as we can now take longer walks and climb higher hills than when we first came. Morison<ref target="#foot.f4"/> passed through on his way to and from Italy, and visited us each time; so you will probably have heard all about Hyères and its surroundings from him already. Mrs. Allen,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I am glad to say, is extremely well, and baby is doing capitally: both of which facts are the more gratifying as the whole family was more or less constantly invalided all last winter, so that I counted upon the change for their sakes almost if not quite as much as for my own. I suppose you are now in the midst of the gaieties of the London season, which I hope you are both thoroughly enjoying. If you can find time to write some day, I shall be glad to hear whether you have been doing any fresh scientific work. For myself, I have been completely lazy ever since Christmas, taking an entire holiday, and enjoying my idleness most thoroughly, after at least three years of high-pressure work. I cannot tell you what a relief it has been to me to have this winter free from the pressing anxieties which have weighed upon me so long, and to feel that I could go out and enjoy myself in the bright sunshine of Provence, without being perpetually harassed as to immediate wants. <hi rend="underline">That</hi> has done me more good than the climate or anything else; though the air here is certainly delicious, and the winter the most pleasant I have ever felt anywhere.— We got cards of Miss Hertz’s wedding,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> but have heard nothing else about it. Of course you and Mrs. Romanes<ref target="#foot.f7"/> went.—</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Allen joins me in very kindest regards to you both; and with best remembrances to your mother and sister,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> believe me, | Yours most sincerely, | Grant Allen.</p>
