<p>I was sincerely glad to receive your note &amp; have news of you;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> for I often think of old days at Cambridge, when I took long walks with the expectant senior wrangler &amp; when he instructed me in Engravings.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I thank you cordially for your kind invitation; but my health has been so bad for several years that I have been unable to attend the British Association, &amp; have no hopes for this year.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> In fact for the last two years I have led the life of a hermit, seeing no one &amp; going nowhere; &amp; doing nothing but two or three hours work daily on my good days at natural History. I am become that most wretched &amp; despicable object, a confirmed valetudinarian. I have much, very much, to be thankful for in life; but everyone has his heavy drawbacks &amp; my own health &amp; even more that of my children is our sore drawback. For years we have had one or other of our children invalids. But I have said enough &amp; more than enough.—</p>
<p>Again I thank you sincerely for your kind remembrance of me, &amp; with hearty good wishes, remain | My dear Whitley | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
