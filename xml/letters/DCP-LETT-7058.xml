<p>Miss Gourlay answers me about that case of face hiding Uncle Ch wanted in detail, but there 〈is〉 almost nothing to say. She does not specially look after that class of women but had a little school for the lowest class of child〈r〉en &amp; of course some of the〈se〉 fall into that way of life.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> This was a case of this kind. it was at the Lock Hospital she saw the girl, or rather did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> see her, for she was in bed &amp; as Miss G approached pulled the clothes over h〈e〉r face, &amp; in spite of all her efforts to draw them off, would not allow her to do so, —so she cd not see any part of her face nor get any 〈ans〉wer from her.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Afterwards on coming out she came to Miss G for help &amp; counsel, but took offence because she gave her too thick &amp; coarse a pair of 〈bo〉ots. That fact is irrelevant but I mention it to shew it was only shame made her hide her face.</p>
<p>I am writing on the sofa, after a bad day. I am so glad to hear of the departure from Tromers.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I think Caroline <hi rend="underline">is</hi> more of a person than R. but as you say it is a great subtraction to have to do without eyes.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
