                        <p>My father is going off tomorrow morning for a rest of a month &amp; asks me to write to you—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> He thanks you for your letter which has amused him much (as it did me)   he says you should publish it in Nature.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> From a letter lately received from Fritz Müller I know there are some stinging plants 〈(〉Dalechampia) in Brazil, &amp; from the way in which he spoke of the European stinging nettle I think it doesn't grow there. I sent his letter to nature &amp; it will soon come out.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He thinks plants protected by stinging hairs from ants, or by milky acrid juice, are specially well fitted for pasture for caterpillars. Try a sloth with stinging nettles. I believe the protecting ants keep the sloths from the Brazilian <hi rend="underline">Cecropia peltata</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> My father thinks the guinea pig theory very probable. He has shown (I think in Animals &amp; Plants) that the guinea pig is distinct from the Apereæ of La Plata: the wild parent of guinea pig is unknown<ref target="#foot.f5"/>   My father will write about crossing if he has anything to say.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                        <p>I shall be delighted to do anything to help your Kew work. I am going to S’hampton in a few days so I fear I cannot look you up as you kindly suggest, I will some day however.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                        <p>My father thought there might be something in the ‘veneration’ theory.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The religious or feudal feeling seems to me to give a nervous system to a community; not only by connecting all parts of the society by something that 〈they〉 feel to be powerful. But it seems 〈to〉 have the explosive or intensify〈ing〉 power of nervous tissue. If 〈one〉 thinks of Cromwells Ironside〈s as〉 an organism &amp; compare them 〈 〉 an organism with a body of 〈  〉 one feels how the theocratic feeling “The Lo〈rd is〉 on our side” gives such contr〈  〉 force to the Puritan organism tha〈t〉 the Royalist one is smashed.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

                <note xml:id="foot.f8">No previous reference to ‘veneration theory’ has been found in letters; however, Francis, CD, and Romanes may have discussed it when Romanes visited Down on 30 May 1877 (Emma Darwin’s diary (DAR 242)).
