<p>My dear Sir</p>
<p>I am very much obliged to you for your kindness in writing to me &amp; for sending me the pamphlets.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> If you can at any time find out about the relative size of the eyes of the Cave Rat, it would be a very great favour.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>You cannot tell how much your paper on Gestation has interested me.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> How facts do beat the wildest imagination! The case of the frogs has interested me particularly, because some time since I read up what I could find on subject, thinking it a good case against my notions, from absence of transitional states; but now your case is something on the road. But the unfortunate male fish with the load of eggs in their mouths exceeds everything;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; what a curious fact about the foreign eggs in the mouths of some.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It is quite a pity that there are not fish of the same group with cuckoo-like habits; your fact would so well have explained how the habit might have arisen.—   Speaking of transitions M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> MacDonnell of Dublin writes to me that he has made some curious discoveries on the electrical organs of the Rays,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> being led thereto by trying to make the case of the Electrical organs, already so very difficult to me, still more unpleasant; but as I understand him his new facts help my views considerably.—</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear that you are collecting facts on the “Bull-dog” fish: I suppose &amp; hope you will bring in about the Nâta cattle.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am now at work in bringing out a Corrected Edition of the “Origin” &amp; I will do myself the great pleasure of sending you a copy when it is published: I could not resist giving briefly your Hog case.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> By the way I have received another analogous fact in case of Horses.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I once saw several years ago D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ackland, &amp; was charmed with him: I am pleased to hear that he defended me against so redoubtable an opposer as Agassiz.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I was rather surprised that the latter did not attack me with more skill.—</p>
<p>Will you kindly forward the enclosed to Prof. Silliman <hi rend="underline">by any</hi> <hi rend="underline">opportunity</hi>: the note is merely to thank him for so kindly writing &amp; giving me information.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Pray believe me, My dear Sir, with sincere thanks &amp; respect | Yours very truly. | C. Darwin</p>
<p>If you ever write again to me, can you refer me to any paper on the Rattle of Rattle-snake; I want to see some account of the tip of tail in the young before the skin has ever been moulted; &amp; the relation of the rattle in the old to the act of moulting. I want to see what relation there is to the tail 〈of〉 Trigonocephalus, the habits of which I mention in my Journal as Vibrating its tail.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
