                    <p>Many happy new years to you &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin and all your party. I think you will be amused with a few extracts from Bishop Stirlings youngest daughter’s letter, who has gone out with him this time; as it gives an amusing account of semi civilised Fuegians.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>“We heard from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. W. a story of our name sake “Stirling”. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bridges was pitching into them all rather strongly one day in his sermon, and Stirling stood up and said “I came here to worship God, and not to be lectured by you”—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>“One or two at the Station have quite large pieces of land, which they are converting into gardens, Stirling is far ahead of any, and takes great pride in his. He has now 12 cows, including calves, and two pigs, so he is quite a rich man, I like him very much; his wife is “Louisa”. and one of his little children “Gertrude”. He said he was pleased to see “Mees” as he called me, as he wanted to see the girl his “little Gerty” was called after”—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>“A few outsiders came over yesterday in their Canoes, among them the leader of the Mapacie long ago”—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>“There are several nice men living here, and the boys who have grown up here look nice manly lads.”</p>
                    <p>“They are very fond of biscuits. Eleanor—“Joe’s” wife—has not been well and papa asked her if he took her any of the biscuits he had given him. He looked quite reproachful as he answered that “he always took it home to her”; and we found that when he had six given him he only eat one, and took five to her”—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>“This morning, one family brought a bucket of milk for sale; and Stirling some butter which he got Louisa to make, because papa asked him if they had any”. “The orphanage children look very jolly”. “James Sulivan<ref target="#foot.f7"/> is a splendid little chap, the jolliest boy here”.</p>
                    <p>“The Eldest orphan girl is to be married tomorrow, she is about sixteen, she is said to be fond of dressing up in M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Whait’s clothes.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Once one of the girls found a stocking, so they took it in turns to wear the one stocking. They always choose who shall sit at the head of their table at meals”—</p>
                    <p>“We went to the Sunday school which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Laurence<ref target="#foot.f9"/> was taking, sometimes one or two of the married men come to it if the room is not too crowded. They sang hyms in English very nicely, and repeated texts, and then translated them into their own language”.</p>
                    <p>“Papa wanted to get two boys for his boat, but found it difficult, as all the nice ones had wives; one wanted to come very much, but as he had a wife papa did not like to take him. Presently he came running &amp; said. “I quick find man not bad, take care of wife”, which meant that Stirling would let her live with him &amp; his wife while he was away: on that “Barry Loring” and his wife would do the same;<ref target="#foot.f10"/> and his wife told him he might go”—so he is coming”—</p>
                    <p>“The other boy is from Lennox Island, a nice small little fellow who does not speak English except “yes”, “Sailor”.— “One of the men who is to be married tomorrow said “he was ashamed to go to church because he had not got any “<hi rend="underline">pants</hi>” to go in “using that expression”.</p>
<p>“This morning we went to the wedding. The bride looked very nice, she was dressed in a pretty blue and white print. The bridegroom too looked very nice. The were both shy, as there were about 78 as a congregation to see the performance.”—</p>
                    <p>“This morning we watched Willie,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> and James Sulivan, sawing wood they did it splendidly”— “The Indians are very sarcastic if displeased at any thing; before leaving Ushuwia the Bridges<ref target="#foot.f12"/> gave away many old clothes, and flour, and one man was discontented because he thought he ought to have more. They had given him less because he was not so deserving, so he shouldered his bag of flour and trudged off saying it was really so heavy, and so large that he could hardy carry it”. When they were off a “splendid” glacier on their way to Sandy point—which from their position I think must be one near Mount Darwin she describes hearing the noise several times of avalanches, sounding like peals of thunder.</p>
                    <p>The Bishop was preparing to hop from Sandy Point to Falklands in a boat sent out from England taking her with him. The boat is decked but only 30 feet long. He had her built for work at Falklands, and sent out by steamer to meet him in Straits: I urged him to send her direct to Falklands as there was great risk if she had heavy weather crossing. I think he goes in her instead of A. Gardiner Yawl<ref target="#foot.f13"/> because he would not send men in her without showing his confidence by going himself with them. Of course she might go often safely, if carefully handled, but she is too small for very heavy weather</p>
                    <p>I am sorry to say I have had a sad account from Mellersh of his health. He went to live at Brighton for his daughter’s health, and was soon very ill with bad liver and an abscess in one lung, and suffering in one leg from sciatica.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> He had been near death for some time, but has been better lately.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bridges has had to return from Ushuwia through breaking down entirely in health.</p>
<p>with our united kind regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin and your family | Believe me dear Darwin | yours very sincerely | B. J. Sulivan</p>
                    <p>I am reading with great interest your G. Fathers life which Mrs. Langton has lent me.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
