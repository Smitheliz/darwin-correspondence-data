<p>Surprised and pleased JBI liked his "big book" [<hi rend="italic">Variation</hi>].</p> 
            <p>Luckily, naturalists do not seem to think he has committed suicide with the work.</p>
            <p>CD wants to turn over the school accounts to John Robinson [curate of Down]. Writes of other parish news.</p>
            <p>Will vote in person for Sir John Lubbock.</p>

<p>I am much obliged for yr kind &amp; pleasant letter, &amp; am equally surprized &amp; pleased that you have liked my big book—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I thought that it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have been too dull for any one but a professed naturalist.</p>
<p>Many thanks for yr notes especially for the case of the pointer, which I think you told me of before, &amp; I have often puzzled myself in trying to remember how I heard it.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Luckily for me naturalists do not seem to think that I have cut my throat in the suicidal manner which you suppose, for I know of one great convert thro’ this book in England, &amp; I am assured that there are many in Germany.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Whenever you like you can send me the balance on the Nat. school acct due from Mr Horsman, but I do not care when as I have already had to advance more than that sum.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I fear there will be much difficulty this year about the school funds as both Mr Stephens<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; Horsman neglected the school &amp; it was found much out of repair, &amp; has cost a good deal.</p>
<p>We have returned from the I. of Wight only about 10 days ago, &amp; I have not seen, tho’ I have called on Mr Robinson who has also been away.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I shd like to hear your opinion whether I might safely pass over the school accounts to him, as it plagues me keeping 3 sets of accounts.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I suppose you can form no opinion how long he will be here. The clergyman also I think w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> best do the begging for the school, &amp; begging there must be.</p>
<p>Lord Cranworth’s death is a great loss to the parish.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I cannot think of any parish news to tell you, except that Mr Smith of Down Court appears in a very delicate state of health.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> We saw Sir John &amp; Lady L. yesterday &amp; both appeared very flourishing. If I possibly can, as I expect will be the case I shall give my vote for Sir John in person, as I think he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> prefer it to my pairing even with such an arch Tory as yourself—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>With both our kind regards to Mrs Innes<ref target="#foot.f11"/> believe me my dear Innes | yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>
