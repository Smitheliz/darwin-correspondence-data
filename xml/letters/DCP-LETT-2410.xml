            <p>His doctor urges CD most strongly not to expose himself to the excitement and fatigue of receiving the [Wollaston] Medal. He will ask Lyell to receive it on his behalf.</p>

<p>I tried my best to put off coming here, but I had such repeated &amp; serious attacks, spending day after day partly in bed, that I had to give up &amp; come here.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am sorry, very sorry to say that the Medical man here urges me <hi rend="underline">most strongly</hi> not to expose myself to the excitement &amp; fatigue of receiving the Medal.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I assure you that this has annoyed me much for my own vanity’s sake &amp; still more for its ungracious appearance. But no one can think that I am insensible to the great honour &amp; mark of sympathy which the Council &amp; you have shown me.— I will ask Lyell to receive the medal for me, if he attends if not, perhaps you will find some one else to receive it for me.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am much annoyed, but it cannot be helped; I held out as long as I could.—</p>

In making the award, Phillips stated: ‘To no one can the Medal which is destined for Mr. Darwin be committed with so much justice as to yourself, who, like him, … have always looked on the phænomena of nature with a comprehensive survey, a minute attention, and a just appreciation of the dignity of our science.’ In accepting the medal on CD’s behalf, Lyell replied: ‘I have been requested by him to acknowledge his gratitude for the high honour conferred on him, which, he says, comes the more unexpectedly because the state of his health has made it impossible for him to attend the meetings of the Society, or to have intercourse with its members as frequently as he could have wished.’ (<hi rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London</hi> 15 (1859), Proceedings, pp. xxiii–xxiv).</note>
