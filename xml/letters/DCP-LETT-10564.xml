                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I should have replied sooner to your last kind and interesting letters, but they reached me in the midst of my packing previous to removal here, &amp; I have only just now got my books &amp; papers in a get-at-able state.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>And first, many thanks for your close observation in detecting the two absurd mistakes in the tabular headings.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>As to the former greater distinction of the North &amp; South American faunas I think I am right.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The <hi rend="underline">Edentata</hi> being proved (as I hold) to have been mere temporary migrants into North America in the Post-Pliocene epoch, form <hi rend="underline">no part</hi> of its <hi rend="underline">Tertiary</hi> fauna. Yet in South America they were so enormously developed in the Pliocene epoch that we <hi rend="underline">know</hi>, if there is any such thing as Evolution &amp;c., that strange ancestral forms must have preceeded them in Miocene times.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mastodon</hi> on the other hand, represented by one or two sp. only, appears to have been a late immigrant into S. America from the North.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>The immense development of Ungulates (in varied families, genera, &amp; species) in North America during the whole Tertiary Epoch is however the great feature, which assimilates it to Europe &amp; contrasts it with S. America. True <hi rend="underline">Camels</hi>, hosts of Hog-like animals, true <hi rend="underline">Rhinoceroses</hi>, &amp; hosts of ancestral <hi rend="underline">Horses</hi>, all bring N. America much nearer to the Old World than it is now. Even the <hi rend="underline">horse</hi>, represented in all S. America by <hi rend="underline">Equus</hi> only, was probably a temporary immigrant from the N.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>As to extending too far the principle (yours) of the necessity of comparatively large areas for the development of varied faunas, I may have done so, but I think not.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> There is I think every probability that most islands &amp;c. where a varied fauna now exists <hi rend="underline">have been</hi> once more extensive,—e.g. N. Zealand Madagascar,— Where there is no such evidence (e.g. Galapagos) the fauna is <hi rend="underline">very restricted</hi>.</p>
<p>Lastly as to want of <hi rend="underline">references</hi>; I confess the justice of your criticism.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> But I am dreadfully unsystematic. It is my first large work involving much of the labour of others. I began with the intention of writing a comparatively short sketch,—enlarged it, and added to it, <hi rend="underline">bit by</hi> <hi rend="underline">bit</hi>; remodeled the tables, the headings, &amp; almost everything else, more than once, &amp; got my materials in such confusion that it is a wonder it has not turned out far more crooked &amp; confused than it is. I no doubt ought to have given references; but in many cases I found the information so small &amp; scattered, &amp; so much had to be combined &amp; condensed from conflicting authorities, that I hardly knew how to refer to them or where to leave off. Had I referred to <hi rend="underline">all authors consulted</hi> for <hi rend="underline">every fact</hi>, I should have greatly increased the bulk of the book,—while a large portion of the references would be valueless in a few years owing to later &amp; better authorities. My experience of refering to references has generally been most unsatisfactory. One finds, nine times out of ten, the <hi rend="underline">fact as stated</hi>, and <hi rend="underline">nothing more</hi>; or a reference to some <hi rend="underline">third work</hi> not at hand!</p>
<p>I wish I could get into the habit of giving chapter &amp; verse for every fact &amp; extract, but I am too lazy &amp; generally in a hurry, having to consult books against time when in London for a day.</p>
<p>However I will try &amp; do something to mend this matter sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. I have to prepare another edition.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I return you Forel’s letter.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> It does not advance the question much, neither do I think it likely that even the complete observation he thinks necessary would be of much use;—because it may well be that the <hi rend="underline">ova</hi> or <hi rend="underline">larvæ</hi> or <hi rend="underline">imagos</hi> of the beetles are not carried <hi rend="underline">systematically</hi> by the ants, but only <hi rend="underline">occasionally</hi> owing to some <hi rend="underline">exceptional circumstances</hi>. This might produce a great effect in distribution yet be so rare as <hi rend="underline">never</hi> to come under observation.</p>
<p>Several of your remarks in previous letters I shall carefully consider. I know that, compared with the extent of the subject, my book is in many parts crude &amp; ill-considered;—but I thought &amp; still think, it better to make <hi rend="underline">some generalizations</hi> wherever possible, as I am not at all afraid of having to alter my views in many points of detail. I was so overwhelmed with zoological details, that I never went through the Geological Soc. Journal<ref target="#foot.f11"/> as I ought to have done, &amp; as I mean to do before writing more on the subject.</p>
<p>With best wishes | Believe me | Yours very faithfully | Alfred R Wallace <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

The Pliocene is the younger epoch of the Neogene period; it formerly included the Gelasian stage, which is now included in the Pleistocene epoch. The Miocene is the older epoch of the Neogene period.
