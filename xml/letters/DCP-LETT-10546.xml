        <abstract>
            <p>Forwards for publication an article by Dr Richardson [apparently not published] showing the necessity of experiments on living animals. Hopes it will make women, "who from the tenderness of their hearts and from their profound ignorance are the most vehement opponents of all such experiments", pause.</p>
