<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lubbock<ref target="#foot.f2"/> told me yesterday of a fact, observed, I believe, by a friend of yours, which interests me particularly; &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> much obliged if you could get me a little more information on the subject, namely the act of cross impregnation in some Balanus.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>The points on which I so much wish for more information, are.— Which was the species; if not known could I see a specimen of the kind. Was the probosciformed penis inserted into more than one individual? For about how long time was it inserted? Was it inserted deeply &amp; at which end of valves? Especially did the recipient individual continue during the time exserting its cirri? Did it keep its opercular valves widely open for the reception of the organ? I am anxious to know whether the recipient was a willing agent or adulterer, or whether it was a case of rape by act.— If the recipient was in full vigour, I think it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be impossible to insert anything without its consent. Were the specimens under water at time?<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Who was the observer that I might quote his authority.</p>
<p>I hope you will kindly forgive all this trouble, for I am really very anxious on this point— Perhaps the simplest plan w<hi rend="subscript">d</hi>. be to forward this note to your friend &amp; back up my request.</p>
<p>I have been very glad to notice what famous progress you are making in your Researches.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
