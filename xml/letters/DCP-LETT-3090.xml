            <p>Thanks GM for his excellent criticisms. His observations on the classification of minerals force him to "own that classification may be closely like that due to descent yet have no relation to it".</p>
            <p>Asks whether GM has observed any cases of "bud-variations".</p>

<p>I am much obliged for your striking note. Your remarks on the races of man are interesting; but I have been particularly struck with your observations on the classification of mineral bodies. The idea had crossed my mind in a very vague &amp; feeble manner: it is so difficult to be honest that I fear that I must have unconsciously banished the idea as disagreeable. I see now the full force of the difficulty &amp; I will make a note not to forget this subject. I must own that classification may be closely like that due to descent &amp; yet have no relation to it. I am grateful for your excellent criticism.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I am very sorry to say that at present I do not feel inclined to subscribe to the testimonial to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newman. I have not a shade of feeling against M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newman; on the contrary I have much respect for his labours. But to t〈he〉 best of my judgment, it seems hardly a case for a testimonial. If one is given to him; I think there are others with at least equal claims— This is my only objection. I will, however, talk with some other naturalists, &amp; I hope my objection may be got over.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Dear Sir | Yours sincerely obliged | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | As you have been so great an observer, I ask two questions for <hi rend="underline">remote</hi> chance of your having facts.— Have you sown seed of weeping trees &amp; what were seedlings?</p>
<p>Have you observed any remarkable cases (excluding mere variegations of leaves) of branch or bud sports, (or as I shall call such cases “<hi rend="underline">bud</hi>-variations”) in leaves, flowers, or fruits.— e.g. nectarines on peach-trees—provence Roses on Moss-roses.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Do not, pray, answer unless you have any facts.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
