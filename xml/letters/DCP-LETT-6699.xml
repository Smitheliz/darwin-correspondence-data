<p>Observe the above address, for I have moved into more comfortable &amp; roomy quarters. I regret exceedingly to learn 〈of〉 your accident, but must nevertheless congratulate you on its being no worse.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> As for the mandrills, I saw the other day at Antwerp adult male, female, and their offspring about 3 weeks old (&amp; remarkably large), but the grown ones were so deep in clean straw that I could not have observed their extent of bareness, even had I tried to do so. This, by the way, was an excellent device to conceal the too demonstrative and gorgeous coloured nudities of the mandrills. There is a young one 〈    〉 in the Regent’s Park collection, &amp; also a juvenile drill. I will endeavour to ascertain what you desire as soon as I can manage it, but the next private day at the <hi rend="underline">B.M.</hi> is Tuesday, before which I cannot get to examine any of the contents of the cases in the public rooms.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Have you seen the just-published portion of the <hi rend="underline">Procs. Z. S.</hi>? It contains a paper by Gray on the <hi rend="underline">Canidæ</hi>, in which are some remarks on natural selection which will amuse you somewhat.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I have just received this weeks <hi rend="underline">Land &amp; Water</hi>, &amp; in the Paris correspondent’s letter (he is the Hon. H. Bingham) you will see some notice of an article on hybrids in the <hi rend="underline">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi>, which letter must be worth your looking over.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I doubt if you will recognise me under the occasional signature of “Caviller”, writing about the <hi rend="underline">Sequoia</hi>;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> but I did send a review for publication this week on a manufactured book of travels, entitled “the Ruined Cities of Zulu Land”, which I have been demolishing unmercifully so much so that I fancy the general editor (Glass) hardly likes to offend the publisher, Chapman &amp; Hall, by putting it in!<ref target="#foot.f6"/> However, I will shew it to Chapman myself, for I suspect that he has been taken in by those fictitious travels, as the reviewer in last week’s <hi rend="underline">Athenæum</hi> was decidedly, &amp; there is a letter from the author in this week’s <hi rend="underline">Athenæum</hi> which bears out my view of the matter.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I believe that it will appear yet. You will have seen the first part of my review of Wallace’s new book, which I was obliged to write somewhat hastily, &amp; I have yet to follow it up as I of course mean to do.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Yours very truly, | E. Blyth</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">No letter has been found in which CD told Blyth of his accident, which occurred on 8 or 9 April (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-6706.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to A. R. Wallace, 14 April 1869</ref> and n. 12).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">No letter to Blyth has been found in which CD enquired about mandrills.

Blyth had visited Antwerp in 1868 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 16, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-6469.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Edward Blyth, 20 November 1868</ref>). Blyth also refers to the gardens of the Zoological Society in Regent’s Park, London, and to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8646.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">British Museum</ref>. CD suspected that the hairlessness of the faces and buttocks of some monkeys was due to sexual selection (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 2: 376–7).

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In his article in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London</hi> (J. E. Gray 1868), <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1959.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Edward Gray</ref> commented (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 510): <quote type="quote"> How any one can think that the differences between varieties of domestic animals are such as zoologists would use to distinguish genera and species, is a mystery that I cannot understand; and the theory that the variation produced by breeding and weeding, or selection as it is called, is to be regarded as the origin of the difference between natural species, is more astonishing, and can only have arisen for want of careful study of the subject. There are some minds so constituted, even among the well educated, who believe in animal magnetism, metallic tactors, table-turning, phrenology, spiritualism, mesmerism, the great pyramid, natural selection, and mimicry of animals—and some even two or more of these theories in succession, or at the same time. </quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The article in <hi rend="italic">Land and Water</hi>, 17 April 1869, p. 255, referred to Armand de Quatrefage’s articles on CD’s theory (Quatrefages de Bréau 1868–9). H. Bingham has not been further identified.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In <hi rend="italic">Land and Water</hi>, 17 April 1869, p. 255, Blyth argued that the genus <hi rend="italic">Sequoia</hi> was identical with the genus <hi rend="italic">Wellingtonia.</hi></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Blyth refers to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8140.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Walmsley 1869</ref>, published by Chapman &amp; Hall. Glass has not been further identified.</note>
