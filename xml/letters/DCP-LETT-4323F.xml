<p>I believe it is months since I have written to you but I have had a good 〈d〉eal of writing on my hands.</p>
<p>On Saturday Mr Engle–went up to consult D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brinton (phys. to Guy’s H.) on your father’s behalf.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He brought back a prescrip. &amp; after he has tried it some little time we shall have Dr. B. down to see him.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He has a great rash come out on his shoulders partly encouraged by a compress &amp; I believe it will be of use to him. He has walked a little further every day &amp; yesterday accomplished twice round the sand walk—</p>
<p>He got so weak at Malvern after you left us he could not walk a step but from one room to another.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I forgot to tell you that Mrs Acland called after you left.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I thought her pleasing &amp; pretty but Hen. w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not allow the prettiness.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I went to Bromley yesterday in Reeves’s fly as Billy has entirely struck work &amp; lay flat down in the yard the last time he was requested to draw.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I heard at Nash’s of the melancholy death of poor Frances Wells whom you thought you saw at Malvern<ref target="#foot.f8"/> She was dressed &amp; going out to dinner when she was suddenly taken ill &amp; died in an hour’s time. It must have been the heart I suppose. I picked up A<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Eliz. at the station &amp; she is come home as fresh as a lark, but they had 16 rainy days which is not what one goes abroad for.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Lizzy comes on Saturday.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Last evening there was a brilliant fire to the South. We settled it to be that timber yard &amp; carpenter’s near the Westerham road but it turned out to be much further off a farm near Tatsfield &amp; a very extensive fire   I hope the poor man is insured.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Oddly enough early this m<hi rend="superscript">g</hi> before light two stacks at Mr Solomon’s were burnt down— I don’t think it can be an incendiary. Mr S. is insured.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Hen. goes next week to Everleigh for a week— Hope<ref target="#foot.f13"/> assures her she will find it very dull &amp; I think it is possible, but young people like a new place. Mr Huxley writes to Papa that I am to treat him like Vivien did Merlin &amp; shut him up in an oak, he then apologizes that Vivien is not a very proper person, but as Papa does not read Tennyson concludes it does not signify.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> They have been coming to fisticuffs in Australia about Darwin &amp; Huxley &amp;c—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>Horace is about as usual &amp; is gone on the pony this m<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>. with Duberry to look after the fire.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> He does a little reading every day.</p>
<p>Goodbye my dear old man | E. D.</p>
