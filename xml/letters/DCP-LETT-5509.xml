<p>I am very sorry your papers on climbing plants never reached you.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> They must be lost, but I put the stamps on myself, &amp; I am sure they were right. I despatched on the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> all the remaining copies, except one for myself. Your letter of Mar 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> contained much interesting matter,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but I have to say this of all your letters.</p>
<p>I am particularly glad to hear that Oncidium flexuosum is endemic, for I always thought that the cases of self-sterility with orchids in hot-houses might have been caused by their unnatural conditions.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am glad also to hear of the other analogous cases, all of which I will give briefly in my book that is now printing.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The lessened number of good seeds in the self-fertilized Epidendrons is to a certain extent a new case.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> You suggest the comparison of the growth of plants produced from self-fertilized &amp; crossed seeds; I began this work last autumn &amp; the result in some cases has been <hi rend="underline">very</hi> striking, but only as far as I can yet judge with exotic plants which do not get freely crossed by insects in this country. In some of these cases it is really a wonderful physiological fact to see the difference of growth in the plants produced from self-fertilized &amp; crossed seeds, both produced by the same parent-plant; the pollen which has been used for the cross having been taken from a distinct plant that grew in the <hi rend="underline">same</hi> flower-pot.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Many thanks for the dimorphic rubiaceous plant.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Three of your Plumbagos have germinated, but not as yet any of the lobelias.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Have you ever thought of publishing a work which might contain miscellaneous observations on all branches of natural history, with a short description of the country &amp; of any excursions which you might take. I feel certain that you might make a very valuable &amp; interesting book, for every one of your letters is so full of good observations. Such books, for instance Bates’s Travels on the Amazons,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> are very popular in England.</p>
<p>I will give your obliging offer about Brazilian plants to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker, who was to have come here to day, but has failed.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> He is an excellent good fellow, as well as naturalist: He has lately published a pamphet, which I think you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to read, &amp; I will try &amp; get a copy &amp; send you.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
