<p>Flattered by JBJ’s discussion of coral reefs [in <hi rend="italic">Voyage of H.M.S. "Fly"</hi> 1 (1847): 347–8]. CD has always thought his <hi rend="italic">Coral reefs</hi> "too bold and speculative", so he is gratified "when anyone who has had opportunities of observation does not give his verdict against it".</p>

<p>Pray accept my thanks for your coloured map of N.E. Australia:<ref target="#foot.f1"/> it is the very thing I was wishing to have the other day, when I was reading your chapters on the Coral Reefs.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have not yet been able to get a copy of your work to go through with it, but I have read carefully all you say on Coral Reefs &amp; been very greatly flattered &amp; pleased.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I admire your boldness about this being a reef-building age &amp; Lyell &amp; myself agreed there was much probability in it. I have always felt that my coral-reef book was too bold &amp; speculative &amp; therefore you will not easily imagine how gratified I am when anyone, who has had opportunities of observation, does not give his verdict against it. The Barrier is certainly a grand feature; but you must have found the coast geology with its everlasting granite very dull: I remember that I used to hate granitic districts. How I wish that fate &amp; your Captain had led you to examine the scattered reefs between the Barrier &amp; N. Caledonia; I have always felt much curiosity about them. I daresay you know M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crawfurd:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> he was speaking to me the other day with much pleasure &amp; interest about the ethnographical part of your book &amp; on this he must be a good judge—</p>
<p>Pray believe me, my dear Sir, Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
