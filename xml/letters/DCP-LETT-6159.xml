<p>I am about to become a candidate for the Sherardian professorship of Botany in this University to which the President &amp; Council of the College of Physicians are electors &amp; which will now very shortly be filled up. It would seem that the limits within which the choice of the electors is by law confined are such as to exclude several persons whose Botanical reputation would render their claim to the office paramount, &amp; that therefore general scientific ability &amp; reputation will probably have some weight with the electors.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> If you should consider, from your acquaintance with my writings that I should be likely to fill the office with credit &amp; not without advantage to the University, I should feel very much indebted to you if you would kindly give some testimony in my favour</p>
<p>I trust you will excuse my applying to you on the subject remembering that by the help of such testimony only can a man not already well known hope to obtain an appointment of this kind, and also that it would be of the greatest advantage to me to obtain the support of your recommendation should you feel at liberty to give it me.</p>
<p>I am dear Sir | Yours faithfully | Gilbert W. Child. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
