<p>The sight of your hand writing did me much good. It would have greatly rejoiced me to have been able to run down to Down for a day, as M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin kindly asked me to do, but I am obliged to be careful at this time of year, for fear of being laid up, and I felt I ought not to delay getting to Winter Quarters.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> As you ask me how I am, I am glad to say much better than I have been for some months, &amp; quite hope to be able to get about thro the winter. I was very ill a few months ago, and hardly thought I should get over it.</p>
<p>I get very stiff and old in my feelings of body, and childish in my mind I think. I do not think I was ever more <hi rend="underline">young</hi> in mind— in fact I have a very enjoyable existence, &amp; I know few I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> exchange with. There now.</p>
<p>I wish you could give yourself a little rest, but I know you cannot. In cælo quies, in terra nulla.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I hear <hi rend="underline">sad</hi> tales about your Book about to come forth.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I suppose you are about to prove man is a descendant from Monkeys &amp;c &amp;c Well, Well!— I shall much enjoy reading it. I have given up that point now. The three main points of difference to my mind—were that Men drink, smoke &amp; thrash their wives—&amp; Beasts do not.</p>
<p>But alas my faith is overthrown entirely. The Lady Monkey from the Andamans—drinks &amp; smokes like a Christian; &amp; evidently the Gentleman w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> thrash, if not kill the Lady, if he had an opportunity.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I always look at Books as I do Newspapers. I am not bound to tye my mind to that of the writer. There are points in your unrivaled Book “The Origin of Species”—which I do not <hi rend="underline">come up to</hi>— but with these few expressions omitted, I go with it completely. I do not think even <hi rend="underline">you</hi> will persuade me that my ancestors ever were Apes— but we shall see.</p>
<p>I have no <hi rend="underline">religious</hi> scruples about any of these matters. I see my own way clearly thro them— —but I see many points I cannot get over, which prevent my going “the whole Hog” with you.</p>
<p>In a few years—if not sooner—we shall know a great deal more than we do now.— We are sadly cribbed <hi rend="underline">here</hi>, and ones mind feels the impossibility of grasping what one longs to do. Well, well! (as a friend of mine always says in a difficulty) let us do <hi rend="underline">our</hi> best, &amp; hope for better things. I must run over &amp; see you some day. Why not you &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin run over here, when you have finished your Book— you can study my little Apes &amp; Apesses—</p>
<p>Kindest regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin &amp; thanks for her note—</p>
<p>Always yours Affec<hi rend="superscript">ly</hi> | W D Fox</p>

She was described in <hi rend="italic">Land and Water</hi>, 24 July 1870, p. 57, by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_300.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Abraham Dee Bartlett</ref>, the superintendent of the Zoological Gardens, who thought she represented a new species, which he proposed to call <hi rend="italic">Macacus andamanensis.</hi> In April 1870 a letter was received from the Andaman Islands pointing out that there were no monkeys indigenous to the Andaman Islands, and that the few that existed there had been brought from Burma (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London</hi> (1870): 220). In June 1870, Bartlett secured a male ‘Andaman monkey’ for the society; it was identified by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Blyth</ref> as identical with a species that he had named <hi rend="italic">Inuus leoninus</hi> (now <hi rend="italic">Macaca leonina</hi>, the northern pigtail macaque). The female, ‘Andaman Jenny’, had become well-known to visitors to the Zoological Gardens for smoking and performing other tricks. (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London</hi> (1870): 663–4.) The male is illustrated in the plate in <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London</hi> (1870): facing p. 664. The macaque in the background is presumably Andaman Jenny.</note>
