<p>I have directed Murray to send you a copy of my book on the Origin of Species, which as yet is only an abstract.— I fear that you will be inclined to fulminate awful anathemas against it.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I assure you that it is the result of far more labour, than is apparent in its present highly condensed state.—</p>
<p>If you have time to read it, let me beg you to read it all straight through, as otherwise it will be unintelligible. Try not to condemn it utterly, till you have finished it &amp; reflected on the recapitulation. Not that I am so foolish as to expect to convert anyone, who has long viewed the subject from an opposite point of view. I remember too well how many long years my own conversion took. The utmost which I hope, is that you may see that more can be said on the side of the mutability of specific forms, than is at first apparent. If indeed your own observations have made you at all sceptical on this subject, then my Book may produce some effect.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Hooker, whose studies make him, I think, one of the most competent judges in Europe, has completely given up species as immutable creations.</p>
<p>Pray forgive me for troubling you with this note, which does not require any answer &amp; pray believe me | Dear Phillips | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
