                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I send you by this mail a paper I have drawn up on a species of Bonatea I discovered here last spring, &amp; which I believe to be new.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> My friend M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Owan of Grahams town informs me that he has looked through all the available literature he has, &amp; that he cannot find any description corresponding with the specimen I sent him.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I sent also some notes on the subject to my friend, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Trimen of Cape Town &amp; he thought it a pity that I should not publish in some English Journal an account of the same.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I had originally intended merely drawing up an account for the Port Elizabeth Natural History Society &amp; botanists &amp;c in the Colony.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I send you a slightly modified paper, which if you think it worthy of further publication I will leave in your hands for the Linnean Society.</p>
<p>I have taken the liberty of proposing the name “Darwinii” if you will permit me to offer this humble return for the stimulus which your works have given me in the Study of Natural History.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am now busily engaged in examining the Asclepiids &amp; have already made some drawings of dissections   I have a vast collection of insects belonging to various orders, but principally Hymenoters covered with the pollinia of different species. So far as my observations go I believe the impregnation of this order to be very simple, &amp; in no way are the contrivances so wonderful as in the Orchids.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have now a very extensive collection of Insects, most however unnamed. Two most singular moths of which the larva cases resemble most perfectly the thorns of the “Acacia horrida”, are, I believe, discoveries of my own. These cases are not, as at first sight they appear, empty thorns, but most beautiful fabrications of the insects themselves, &amp; are so deceptively like the real thorns that they would have entirely escaped my notice had I not seen them move.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I believe that I have discovered four more species or varieties of Rhopalocera most from the Karoo, but have not yet been able to describe them to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Trimen.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. T. has asked me to accompany him on a short tour to Natal &amp; I write by next post to him to enquire when he starts,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> as I am just about making a month excursion to more thoroughly examine the Bushman caves mentioned by Barrow &amp; Burchell in the Tarka Mountains, as also some recent beds near the G<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Fish River.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I hope to be able to obtain before many months the head of a Bushman murderer, but it is difficult to convince the authorities of the interests of Science.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I have long been on the look-out.</p>
<p>Should I accompany M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Trimen, to Natal I shall probably return home with him in May to England, as my friends have long been pressing me<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I enjoy this country so much that I do not like to leave it for ever, but again home ties, after over 4 years, influence one’s feelings much</p>
<p>I shall endeavour to send you a copy of the “G<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Eastern” with a letter by me signed ‘Gogaje Man’, a name by which I am well known out here,<ref target="#foot.f13"/> &amp; I do so because I think D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Brown’s parting letter to the colonists a gross insult.</p>
<p>On his journey to Colesberg, he himself informed me he had collected no plants, &amp; when I shewed him a species of “<hi rend="underline">Disperis</hi>” of which I wanted to know the specific name, he did not even recognise it as an orchid.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>So far as D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Brown’s Blue Books are concerned they are simply compilations from other people’s works, &amp; I do not know of a single original observation in any of his Colonial works.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>As D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Brown has received a salary equal to that of a Civil Commissioner in this country I think</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">A natural history society was formed in Port Elizabeth in 1866; meetings were held in a building that also housed the Town Hall, Library, and Athenaeum Society (personal communication, Margaret Harradine, Port Elizabeth Municipal Libraries). Bedford lies inland, almost directly north of Port Elizabeth, which is on Algoa Bay, on the south-eastern coast of Cape Colony. The area near Algoa Bay was settled by the British in 1820 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2248.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">EB</hi></ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In the manuscript of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8222.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Weale 1867</ref> (see n. 1, above), Weale proposed the specific name ‘Darwinii’ for the <hi rend="italic">Bonatea</hi> orchid, in honour of the ‘great naturalist’ from whose works he had ‘derived so much enlightenment &amp; incitement to prosecute the study of living beings’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">In a letter that has not been found, Weale evidently wrote to CD about the family Asclepiadaceae; CD replied that there was still much to be discovered regarding its pollination, and that he once saw a hymenopter from America with its tarsi covered with pollen from an <hi rend="italic">Asclepias</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 13, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4828.xml" resp="#automat">letter to J. P. M. Weale, 6 May [1865]</ref> and nn. 5 and 6). Weale later published a paper on pollination in the Asclepiadaceae (Weale 1870).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The moth that Weale refers to is an unidentified species of the family Psychidae, whose members are now commonly known as bagworms. CD referred to Weale and his observation of the caterpillars’ cases ‘on the mimosas in South Africa’ in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 1: 416. Weale later published a paper on the thorn and foliage imitators found on <hi rend="italic">Acacia horrida</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8228.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Weale 1878</ref>); he mentioned the caterpillar he had described to CD, without giving its scientific name, on page 185.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Trimen had recently completed publication of his three-volume work on South African butterflies, <hi rend="italic">Rhopalocera Africæ Australis</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7821.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Trimen 1862–6</ref>). Weale later published on the Rhopalocera; see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8227.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Weale 1877</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">In March and April 1867, Trimen visited Natal, collecting insects along the South Coast and as far inland as Pietermaritzburg and Noodsberg (Gunn and Codd 1981, p. 351).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Weale refers to the accounts by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_296.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Barrow</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_728.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William John Burchell</ref> of their respective travels in South Africa (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_386.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. Barrow 1801–4</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1077.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Burchell 1822–4</ref>). Barrow mentioned ‘Bushman’ caves and rock drawings on the east side of the Tarka Mountains, north of Algoa Bay (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_386.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. Barrow 1801–4</ref>, 1: 239–41, 307–8). For eighteenth and nineteenth-century European perceptions of indigenous South Africans, and contemporary meanings of the term ‘Bushman’, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2165.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dubow 1995</ref>, pp. 20–32; the peoples known to many nineteenth-century Europeans as ‘Bushmen’ are now considered to be members of the Khoisan peoples. Barrow also described the Great Fish River and some adjacent hot springs (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_386.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. Barrow 1801–4</ref>, 1: 184–91, 307–8); the Great Fish River drains into the Indian Ocean north-east of Port Elizabeth. In an 1865 letter written to the <hi rend="italic">Natural History Review</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8221.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Weale 1865</ref>), Weale also mentioned his intention of visiting some caves (see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 13, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4828.xml" resp="#automat">letter to J. P. M. Weale, 6 May [1865]</ref> and n. 7).</note>

Judging from Weale’s 1867 correspondence with CD, it is unlikely that Weale also travelled to England in 1867.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f13">Weale’s letter of 5 January 1867 appeared in the 10 January 1867 issue of the <hi rend="italic">Great Eastern</hi>, a newspaper published in Grahamstown. Another letter of his of 12 January 1867 appeared in the 19 January 1867 issue. See n. 14, below. It is not known whether he sent either letter to CD.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f14">Weale refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_7116.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Croumbie Brown</ref>, who had returned to the United Kingdom late in 1866 after his appointment as colonial botanist was terminated, evidently owing to budget constraints. Brown’s parting letter in the 1 January 1867 issue of the <hi rend="italic">Great Eastern</hi> stressed his work on ‘the natural history, botanical characters, and economic uses of the trees, shrubs, and economic herbs of Southern Africa’; he also noted the minimal expense to the government required for his work and associated travel. According to a testimonial and a notice in the <hi rend="italic">Great Eastern</hi>, 8 January 1867, pp. 2 and 3, the termination of Brown’s appointment was controversial. Weale’s two letters to the <hi rend="italic">Great Eastern</hi> (see n. 13, above) were intensely critical of Brown’s botanical knowledge and skill. Weale also accused Brown of preaching rather than collecting specimens, and of extravagant spending.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f15">Brown promoted the study of botany while in South Africa as colonial botanist; however, his own publications during this time were limited to government reports, in which he dealt with agricultural problems, forestry, and soil erosion. He later published books and papers primarily on forestry (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_970.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. C. Brown 1977</ref>, p. 465, Gunn and Codd 1981). Blue books contain the official publications of the British Parliament and Privy Council, and the term is extended to other official publications (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5936.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">OED</hi></ref>). Weale criticised Brown’s blue books in the <hi rend="italic">Great Eastern</hi> of 10 and 19 January 1867 (see n. 14, above).</note>
