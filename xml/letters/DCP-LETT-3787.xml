<p>My cat Greysy deserted her 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> kitten Bullsig when it was a month old, I suppose because she had no milk, as it was always thin &amp; she neglected it so that we heard its remarkably loud mews from the cellar over the house. Bullsig always wished to play with his mother whilst she hated &amp; repulsed him; till the night before her confinement when she let him get into the basket prepared for her &amp; touzle her as much as he liked, though he didn’t try to suck her. We saved the kitten she had next day &amp; ever after he used to suck her &amp; stay in the basket at the same time with his younger brother. She was now a very good mother, &amp; kept them very fat.—</p>
<p>My kitten Miss Legge I took from its mother when she was a month old &amp; cd not eat meat, so that it was a great deprivation. At Hartfield where we were,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> there was an old cat &amp; kittens &amp; about 2 days after we got there she adopted this cat &amp; sucked it with the others. She had this mother for a fortnight &amp; then nearly 3 weeks interval till we came to Shanklin where there were two old cats giving milk &amp; 3 kittens.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> She took to both these cats &amp; played with the kittens. One day I observed her snowzling in the stomach of the kittens, &amp; constantly beginning to purr as soon as she thought she had found the tit. She did not leave off till its whole stomach was quite wet.—</p>
<p>our Ilkley<ref target="#foot.f4"/> cat used to suck its own stomach when it was happy just like a child does its thumb. It did it a great part of the day, &amp; used to purr over it as if it was so good.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD’s annotations suggest that Henrietta’s account of these incidents was intended as possible evidence for a planned treatment of instinct; however, her testimony on these points was not referred to by CD in any publication. In her manuscript autobiography (DAR 246: 11–12), Henrietta recalled that, as a child, she would sit ‘for long hours’ watching her cats, and ‘sympathising with the cat’s admiration of her kittens’.</note>
