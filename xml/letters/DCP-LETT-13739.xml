<p>In a forthcoming lecture GCW will dispute Haeckel on <hi rend="italic">Protista</hi> and his statement that spontaneous generation is necessary to complete evolution as a doctrine. Wishes to confirm his understanding that CD has nowhere expressed himself on the "origin of life", and has considered only the manner of succession.</p>

<p>In a lecture I am about to give on the Threshold of Evolution, in which I dispute, <hi rend="underline">in toto</hi>. Haeckel’s statements concerning the “Protista”, I am anxious to show that a statement put forward by him &amp; others—that ‘Spontaneous generation, as necessary to the completeness of Evolution as a doctrine”—has nowhere received your sanction.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Should you not consider the question an objectionable one, would you kindly inform me if my interpretation of your published views is, to this extent, a correct one? I would not, of course, think of mentioning that I had your authority for denying the statement, or that I would have even addressed you at all on the point without your express sanction.</p>
<p>It has alwas been my opinion that you had intentionally left the question of the ‘Origin of Life’ uncanvassed as being ‘ultra vires’ in the present state of our knowledge, &amp; dealt only with the manner of its Succession.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I restrict myself, in my small way, to the attempt to prove, as I believe I shall be able to do beyond reach of doubt, that the Protista furnish no trustworthy evidence, one way or the other; &amp; that their very existence, as an independent group of organisms, is a fiction, resulting from hasty &amp; imperfect observation.</p>
                    <p>I will with your permission send you a copy of my lecture as soon as it is in print.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Hoping, meanwhile, that you will excuse me for troubling you under the circumstances, | I remain | Yours faithfully | G. C. Wallich.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2048.xml">Ernst Haeckel</ref>’s kingdom Protista included various single-celled organisms such as rhizopods and diatoms, as well as a division called Monera, a taxon of unicellular organisms without nuclei or organelles; in his phylogenetic tree, it was depicted as the central kingdom with Plantae and Animalia on either side (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3261.xml">Haeckel 1866</ref>, 1: 203–6; 2: plate 1). In the first part of his <hi rend="italic">Biologische Studien</hi> (Biological studies; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3274.xml">Haeckel 1870–7</ref>, 1: 60), Haeckel stated that the oldest original forms of all Monera, simple structureless protoplasmic clumps, had arisen by spontaneous generation (<hi rend="italic">generatio aequivoca</hi>). Wallich had countered Haeckel’s views in an article, ‘The threshold of evolution’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11731.xml">G. C. Wallich 1880</ref>), published in <hi rend="italic">Popular Science Review</hi>, April 1880. His lecture ‘On the fallacy of the materialistic origin of life’ was read at the Victoria Institute, 17 April 1882, but not published in full (see <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Transactions of the Victoria Institute, or Philosophical Society of Great Britain</hi> 16 (1882–3): 344). A report of the lecture appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi>, 18 April 1882, p. 5.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6019.xml"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> 6th ed.</ref>, p. 98, CD had referred to spontaneous generation as an unproven belief.</note>
