<p>I enclose a copy of some notes Langstaff has made from observation since receiving your letter to me. He does not know that they are of least use, but thought it just worth while sending you. I return you your letters so that you can see what you said in them.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>As to business, I am going over to see P at his house in a day or two when I have great hopes we shall get over the first difficulty as to money; as I had a talk with them last week and we very nearly came to terms. H. is away on leave, so that P. must be quite up to work.</p>
<p>I told A. that in your opinion, he made too much of the come down for him, &amp; that everyone would simply look at it in the way of business, &amp; I think it relieved him.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am going over to Embley tomorrow for dinner, &amp; probably shall meet D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hooker.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The Park will be looking delicious.</p>
<p>I think I am improved by my stay at Malvern, but I am not the thing yet, tho’ not much amiss.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Langstaff will be very glad to observe anything else.</p>
<p>He has now had many opportunities of watching for blushing on the body, but has not seen a trace of it even with profuse blushing in the face.</p>
<p>Your affect son | W E Darwin</p>
<p>I have ordered the clips to be sent you.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Wednesday</hi></p>
<p>I have had to keep back this letter till I could get Langstaff to translate some of his writing.</p>
<p>I will take a trip to Swanage the first day I can get—on a Sunday I could not see the <hi rend="italic">[</hi>interiors<hi rend="italic">]</hi> probably<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
