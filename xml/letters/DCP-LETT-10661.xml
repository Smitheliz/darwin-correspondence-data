<p>I send you by book post an odd volume of a Japanese printed picture book which I think will interest you because it contains two pages on which the various expressions of the human countenance are drawn with considerable vigour.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I imagine the figures are intended to represent countenances on which the conditions which usually only accompany the various emotions laughter, suspicion, disgust &amp;c, are from habit or senile or other states of the facial muscles and tissues more or less constantly present and which are thus grotesque. It is very possible that you have seen the book before. It is one which is commonly bought by Europeans in Japan and from which many illustrations have been copied into English works on the country. It is complete in 14 volumes.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have three copies of the volume which I send you and shall be very glad if you will accept of this one if you care for it.</p>
<p>I formed a large collection of Japanese illustrated books and manuscripts when I was in the country and amongst them I have one on Physiognomy with a series of rough figures of the various shapes of eyebrows and of eyes and maps of the face with the various regions depicted.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have also a general work on Necromancy, in which physiognomy and palmistry are treated of with figures of the various classes of countenances of men and women and of the various arrangements of the lines on the palm.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I would send you these if they would interest you.</p>
<p>I enclose a photograph of a Falkland Island stone stream which you may care to have.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have a duplicate copy.</p>
<p>Hoping you will excuse the liberty I have taken in writing to you | I remain yours truly | H. N. Moseley late naturalist on board H.M.S Challenger. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

Hokusai’s manga were published in fifteen volumes. Some of Moseley’s Japanese books and manuscripts were donated to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, after his death. The Bodleian collection includes a fourteen-volume set of Hokusai’s manga, published in Nagoya in the late Edo period (Izumi Tytler, Bodleian Japanese Library, personal communication).</note>
