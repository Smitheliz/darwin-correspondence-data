<p>I hope I have not acted wrongly in sending your most interesting letter to “Nature” for publication.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It seemed to me a shame to keep such interesting facts to myself. If your letter is printed, as I do not doubt will be the case, I will send you a copy.</p>
<p>The little bodies produced by Ceropegia resemble those on the leaflets of the “bull’s horn” acacia, which plant they have living at Kew, &amp; I intend to get a specimen for my son &amp; self to observe.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Now unless you intend to follow out this subject, I should be very much obliged if you could send me some seeds of the Ceropegia; or would it be possible to send me in a letter enclosed in bladder or tin-foil a few shoots, which if the plant is a climber, might possibly keep alive so as to be propagated.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>In your last letter you spoke as if you would no longer be able to observe facts in Natural History, but I am convinced that as long as you are alive you will continue to make new &amp; brilliant observations.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Many years ago I suggested to you to publish a sort of Natural History Journal and account of the country, &amp; I believe that you would thus make a book of extraordinary interest—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In his letter of 25 December 1875 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 23), Müller had enclosed specimens of the small white bodies (now known as Müllerian bodies) found on the cushion-like structure (now called the trichilium) at the base of the petiole of leaves of <hi rend="italic">Cecropia</hi> (the embauba or trumpet tree). CD misread the genus name (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10391.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Charles and Francis Darwin to W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, 14 February [1876]</ref>). In 1874, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref> had sent CD a specimen of bull-horn acacia (typical species are <hi rend="italic">Acacia cornigera</hi> or <hi rend="italic">A. collinsii</hi>) from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; CD had recognised the appendages remarked on by Hooker as the small lipid-rich food bodies on the tips of leaflets that were described by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_383.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Belt</ref> in <hi rend="italic">The naturalist in Nicaragua</hi> (Belt 1874, pp. 218–20; see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 22, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9548.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 15 July 1874</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9550.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 16 July 1874</ref>). They are now known as Beltian bodies.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">No record that Müller sent any seeds or shoots has been found.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10155A.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter of 12 September 1875</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 23), Müller had written that he might be forced to abandon natural history. He had not been paid the small monthly stipend that had allowed him to continue his scientific work, and his expected appointment to a government-sponsored post in the national museum was stalled because of a ministerial crisis. By the time Müller wrote his letter of 25 December 1875 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 23), his situation had improved thanks to a change in government, and he received a paid appointment as a travelling naturalist in October 1876. For more on Müller’s difficulties with the provincial government at this time, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8290.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">West 2003</ref>, pp. 185–90.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In his letter of <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5509.xml">22 April [1867]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 15), CD had suggested that Müller should write a book of ‘miscellaneous observations on all branches of natural history’, noting that such books were very popular in England.</note>
