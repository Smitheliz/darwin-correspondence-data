<p>We were so much delighted to get your Capital letter which I relished much, as it recalled old scenes on board the Beagle.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am very sorry that the S.E. Trades were so bad, for they were to us Heaven on Earth.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have often intended writing a scrap to you before, but my bothering correspondents seem steadily to increase in number, and I think in folly, for I have just answered two precious fools. I have been working very hard about the Droseraceæ, and now see day light., for I have only one other very long chapter to write out for the first time, and then will begin the tedious work of making sentences ship-shape, and choosing the best words.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Murray’s sale occurred the other day and 2070 copies of my books were sold, including 1350 of the new Edit of the Descent which quite satisfies me—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>We go up to Henrietta’s next week, and I shall be very glad of a few days rest.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>As far as I can judge Frank write a very valuable essay on capillary circulation, which is an important subject as bearing on inflammation, which common as it is, is very little understood<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Farewell my dear Leonard— the Lord have mercy on us to think that you were once a pouter with long curly hair</p>

When on board the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi>, CD participated in the ‘most disagreeable operation’ of having his face rubbed with paint and tar before he was ‘shaved’ with a saw (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 1, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-158.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to R. W. Darwin, 8 February – 1 March 1832</ref>). Leonard was travelling to New Zealand as part of the scientific expedition to observe the transit of Venus.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD had begun writing up his research on <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> (sundew) at the beginning of April 1874 (‘Journal’ (Appendix II)); it was published as <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4097.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Insectivorous plants</hi></ref> on 2 July 1875 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2661.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Freeman 1977</ref>).</note>

A total of 2093 books were sold; 2070 is possibly a misreading by the copyist.</note>
