<p>I must thank you for your letter, received about a fortnight ago— It was extremely kind of you to write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lubbock, &amp; I think he was much pleased &amp; flattered at receiving your letter.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am very glad you mentioned your objection to my views on the nature of the three pairs of appendages in the earliest stage of cirripedes;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> by an odd chance I was at the time searching for all sorts of evidence, &amp; had just dissected the larva of an Hippolyte (sent me by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C. S. Bate) &amp; as far as sequence goes, I find M. Joly’s views, that the three natatory pairs of legs are the 3 pairs of maxillipeds, are true for they <hi rend="underline">closely</hi> follow the 2 pairs of jaws &amp; mandibles.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Since my former volume I have gone into the curious case of a S. American cirripede in which the larvæ in all the first stages are typified by an egg-like larva, with the pairs of anterior horns, &amp; posterior horn including the abdomen: &amp; in this case I actually dissected out of the anterior horns the usual prehensile antennæ, with every part perfect. Indeed it is very certain that the larva in the first stage has 2 pairs of antennæ in process of development;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> a mouth as yet without the 3 pairs of gnathites; &amp; the 3 pair of natatory legs, which may be, as in Hippolyte, the 3 pairs of maxillipeds, &amp; Caridina, but which I fully believe are the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> thoracic limbs.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I have entered all these points with care in my present volume; &amp; I cannot say, how I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be gratified if you could ever find time to criticise it. I presume I shall not get it printed for 4 or 5 months, but I will, when printed, of course send you a copy.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It will be more fully illustrated than the last.— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. say that I have found many useful hints &amp; cautions in your great work.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> By the way I have received the duplicate page.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I am not much surprised at your correspondence with A. White having failed: I am told by some of his friends, poor fellow, that he has been for some considerable time, somewhat flighty in his head:<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have long perceived that though very clever, that he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not do much from his fickleness.— There is, I hope, a rising Crustaceologist in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C. S. Bate (to whom I am soon going to lend your Book): he is an <hi rend="underline">ardent</hi> observer, though I apprehend rather rash in theorising, &amp; what is worse in observing: I suspect he trusts to the compound microscope &amp; does not dissect enough, which I believe to be a fatal habit— He is intending to publish with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Westwood, a monograph of sessile-eyed crustaceans of Britain.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Bell is too busy ever I fear to do much;<ref target="#foot.f11"/> he is a delightful, kind-hearted person. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Baird is a very goodnatured man, but rather indolent, &amp; occupied with routine business at the B. Museum &amp; I doubt whether very original,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> and this includes, as far as I know, all the English Crustaceologists; &amp; I have <hi rend="underline">confidentially</hi> given you what I think of them.</p>
<p>Sir C. &amp; Lady Lyell were staying here a short time since: they start in two days time for Madeira &amp; the Canaries, to work out Craters of Elevation or of Denudation; &amp; he is well charged with points to observe.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>To return to Crustacea were you not rather surprised at Milne Edwards new classification in the Annales for 185〈  〉?—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I was astonished at parts &amp; could not at all, understand his reasons:— But I have an unbounded respect for M. Edwards as a Naturalist<ref target="#foot.f15"/> From some old theoretical notions, I was interested by what you say about Crustacea not having been most developed in Tropics:<ref target="#foot.f16"/> should you ever work this out in other branches, either in regard to mere numbers of species, or their rank I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be particularly glad to hear the result. At one time D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker (who is a first rate naturalist, after your own heart) thought that a greater <hi rend="underline">number of</hi> species of plants existed in the warmer temperate lands than under torrid zone; but he now doubts whether there are materials to determine this point.</p>
<p>Believe me, Your’s very sincerely &amp; cordially | C. Darwin</p>

In his general discussion of the classification of Crustacea (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 11), CD compared Milne-Edwards’s and Dana’s views: <quote> In the classification of Crustacea, the relation and number of the segments of the different parts of the body, are viewed both by Prof. Milne Edwards and Mr. Dana, as of the highest importance. I may premise that both these authors divide the Crustacea into Podophthalmia, Edriophthalmia, and Entomostraca; Milne Edwards making a fourth legion, the Branchiopoda, and another division, including Limulus, of equal value to the above four legions altogether; whereas Dana sinks Limulus and the Branchiopoda under his Entomostraca. As far as concerns our present discussion on Cirripedes, the first three divisions, as valued by Dana, will best serve as standards of comparison; but it is not unimportant to our present purpose, as showing how difficult it is to weigh the value of the higher divisions of a Class, to observe the wide difference in opinion of two naturalists, so eminent for their knowledge of the class in question and for their high abilities.</quote></note>
