<p>I had thought of going to you on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. &amp; was only waiting to see my way a little.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I find however that the examinations of Army Asst. Surgeons will prevent me,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; so I shall try &amp; get down on the following Saty. if you are well enough to see me.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am puzzled about the Falconer affair, not what to subscribe, for I have no hesitation in thinking that £1"1. or £2"2 would be ample, adding if necessary afterwards to £5.5.0 the object being to secure a bust only—for which £100 or £150 should be enough. But I like to see these subscriptions confined to definite objects &amp; bodies—as far as possible,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; especially in Falconers case, because I suspect that Botanists will not subscribe with enthusiasm.—for this simple reason, that though he enjoyed for nearly 25 years the most magnificent pay as a Botanist, he did nothing Botanical for it—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> his collections he let go to ruin, his mss he shut up &amp; would let no one see.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> As Superintendent of the Gardens his name was a bye-word in Calcutta &amp; a scandal elsewhere. Poor dear old F. these are very hard things for a friend to say—but so it is— it is impossible to exaggerate the mischief he did. He very nearly brought about the abandonment of the Calcutta Gardens, &amp; to all my appeals at the India House for something to be done for Botany, <hi rend="underline">Falconer</hi> was thrown in my teeth.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> So my idea is that the Geolog. Soc. should form the subscription &amp; confine it to their own Members,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; his friends afterwards subscribe for a copy of the bust if so disposed. I will subscribe to both.</p>
<p>I have not seen Heers paper nor Wallaces,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> for indeed I have been &amp; am hard worked this winter. I look to, &amp; only look to! reading Lyell with great interest.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> There is a good deal of snarling at him since Falconers death.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I do wish that he had only shown himself at the Funeral, but he is far from strong.</p>
<p>How I should like to write the book you want on Botany—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> it has been as you know a dream of mine for a very long period. No one could do it so well as yourself!</p>
<p>Ever Yrs affec | J D Hooker</p>
<p>P.S. I have just heard from Anderson that he has given Scott the Curatorship of the Gardens with £240 a year &amp; house<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4772.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter of 15 [February 1865]</ref>, CD had warned Hooker to visit on any Saturday other than 25 February, when the Darwins expected other visitors.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Hooker was one of the examiners in science for medical officers in the armed services (L. Huxley ed. 1918, 1: 387). Examinations for army medical officers were held at Chelsea Hospital in February and March 1865 (<hi rend="italic">Statistical, Sanitary, and Medical Reports</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Army Medical Department</hi>) 7 (1865): 605–6).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">According to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242), Hooker visited Down House between 4 and 6 March 1865.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD had asked Hooker what would be an appropriate contribution to the fund being raised for a marble bust of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1585.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hugh Falconer</ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4772.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 15 [February 1865]</ref>). For two additional memorials made to Falconer, see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4774.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from George Busk, 20 February 1865</ref>, n.4.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Although Falconer had been superintendent of the botanic garden in Saharanpur, north-west India, from 1832 to 1842, and superintendent of the botanic garden in Calcutta and professor of botany at the Calcutta Medical College from 1848 to 1855 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2063.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>), he became known primarily for his geological and palaeontological research; however, see also nn. 7 and 8, below. A list of Falconer’s botanical memoirs and reports is provided in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2434.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Falconer 1868</ref>, 1: lv–lvi; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1985.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">R. Desmond 1994</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">When Falconer returned to Britain in 1843 (see n. 6, above), he brought back seventy chests of dried plants, which suffered damage from damp on the voyage and in the cellars of East India House, the headquarters of the East India Company, where they were deposited (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2434.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Falconer 1868</ref>, 1: xxxv). In preparing <hi rend="italic">Flora Indica</hi>, Hooker and Thomas Thomson, referring to Falconer as ‘one of the most estimable, able, and accomplished of Indian botanists’, also recorded that his ‘magnificent’ India collection, with ‘voluminous notes’ was the only herbarium of importance to which they could not procure access (Hooker and Thomson 1855, pp. 67–8). However, it is not clear whether the poor condition and inaccessibility of the collection was the fault of Falconer or the East India Company; in 1858, the year after the East India Company was dissolved, Hooker secured several collections for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, from the East India Company’s cellars. These collections had all suffered from long neglect, and included Falconer’s (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1986.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">R. Desmond 1995</ref>, pp. 200–1, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5071.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">McCracken 1997</ref>, p. 154, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1987.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">R. Desmond 1999</ref>, p. 206).</note>

For positive accounts of Falconer’s work in India, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2434.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Falconer 1868</ref>, 1: xxxix–xl, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1984.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">R. Desmond 1992</ref>, pp. 98–100, 223, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5071.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">McCracken 1997</ref>, pp. 8, 20. Hooker felt that the East India Company, which was effectively Falconer’s employer in Calcutta, had treated Falconer far better than he and his colleague Thomson had been treated as collectors and botanists, and that the company had provided insufficient support and recognition of his and Thomson’s labours (L. Huxley ed. 1918, 1: 355–8, 2: 145–6, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1987.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">R. Desmond 1999</ref>, pp. 201, 217–19, 250–1). In 1869 and later years, Hooker still despaired over the support for and progress of the study of botany in India (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3990.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">L. Huxley, ed. 1918</ref>, 2: 17, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1984.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">R. Desmond 1992</ref>, pp. 102, 323, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5071.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">McCracken 1997</ref>, p. 23, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1987.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">R. Desmond 1999</ref>, p. 270). Hooker eventually published the seven-volume <hi rend="italic">Flora of British India</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3808.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hooker 1872–97</ref>)</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Falconer had been a fellow of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1841.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Geological Society of London</ref> since 1842 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4818.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">List of the Geological Society of London</hi></ref>).</note>
