                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>

<p>May I ask if you will kindly favour me with an expression of your opinion as to my fitness to fill the Chair of General and Comparative Physiology at the Royal Veterinary College here.</p>
<p>The Governors have advertised for a Professeur and I am about to become Candidate.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Besides my published researches which have been more particularly devoted to Comparative Anatomy and Zoology my training in Physiology and the branches connected therewith has been ample. Chemistry I studied with vigour for a long time working at analysis organic and organic so as almost to have prepared myself to follow that instead of anatomical pursuits.</p>
<p>I respectively held the Offices of Pathologist to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary—Assistant Conservator Museum Royal College of Surgeons London, Prosector Zool. Soc. and Lecturer on Comp. Anat &amp; Zoology at Middlesex Hospital.</p>
<p>Altogether I have devoted some 20 years to Biology in all its phases and with experience as a Teacher, Experimenter &amp;c shall only be too glad to continue my researches and be the instructor of others</p>
<p>As I have only just learned of the Vacancy, and find the application testimonials &amp;c have to be sent in by Thursday next (4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. April) I shall feel favoured by an early reply</p>
<p>Trusting in your support | I am | Dear Sir | Yours with esteem | James Murie</p>
<p>P.S. I owe you an apology for remissness in answering some questions respecting the elevation of the horses tail &amp;c but as I have had much anxiety of late and the subject a difficult one to reply to—I left it aside for the time being.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Some 2 large Monographs of mine are now printed off and I hope their issue very shortly<ref target="#foot.f3"/>   I regret you have not seen them as I am sure they will please</p>
