<p>Very many thanks for your ten notes, and enclosures: I had seen the Paragraph otherwise I should have been much interested in the death of (as he styled himself) “Comte Thierry, King of Nukahiva and Sovereign Chief of New Zealand”<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I wonder what has become of his wretched wife. I sincerely hope that your allotments will succeed;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> all that I have read in favour of them sounds most encouraging, and I have never been convinced by what has been written against them. I have bought a Farm in Lincolnshire and when I go there this Autumn, I mean to see what I can do in providing any cottage on my small estate with gardens— It is a hopeless thing to look to but I believe few things would do this Country more good in future ages<ref target="#foot.f4"/> than the destruction of primogeniture,—so as to lessen the difference in land wealth &amp; make more small freeholders.— How atrociously unjust are the stamp laws which render it so expensive for the poor man to buy his <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> of an acre,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> it makes one’s blood burn with indignation. Have you seen Lyells Travels?<ref target="#foot.f6"/> He says the poorer classes in Canada complain of the timber duties! so that our Cottages are badly built under pretence to benefit a few rich merchants really no doubt for our own landowners.</p>
<p>Thanks for the slip about the Crag— I am astonished that stones containing 50–60 per cent of Phosphate of Lime are not most valuable.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>A fortnight ago we had born a little boy, our fourth child.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> He is to be called George; &amp; I believe I have pleasant associations with that name from formerly playing with your Boy.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I hope M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Henslow is better.</p>
<p>Farewell. | C. D.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is given as it appears on a copy of the letter in the Cambridge University Library (the original has not been found). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1222.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Darwin</ref> in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4842.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">LL</hi></ref> 1: 343 n. refers to it as of ‘July 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>’, but the reference to George Darwin’s birth (on 9 July) makes that impossible. It does suggest, however, that the original may have been dated simply ‘Friday’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Charles Philip Hippolytus, Baron (not Comte) de Thierry. The report of his death was false. As ‘Sovereign Chief of New Zealand’ he threatened to take by force land which he claimed to own (see <hi rend="italic">New Zealand encyclopaedia</hi>). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1650.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Robert FitzRoy</ref> records that the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi>’s arrival in New Zealand caused alarm because it was mistaken for Thierry’s ship (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5784.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Narrative</hi></ref> 2: 567).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Henslow had begun a scheme to provide the poor country labourers of his parish with gardens by sub-letting small plots to them. He met with strong opposition from the farm-owners. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4193.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Jenyns 1862</ref>, pp. 88–92, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6810.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Russell-Gebbett 1977</ref>, pp. 30–1.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">‘in future ages’ is interlined in the copyist’s hand and was probably also interlined in the original.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Stamp duty payable on a conveyance on sale was made up of a sum charged for the deed and a sum calculated upon the value of the property transferred. For a large sale, e.g., CD’s farm at Beesby, this would amount to about 1% of the selling price, but for a small sale, a <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> acre of land for, say, £20–30, it would be nearer 10%.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Henslow had discovered beds of phosphate nodules in the Suffolk Crag while on holiday. Analysis showed them to be rich in phosphate of lime, which Henslow pointed out made them a useful source of fertiliser. (Henslow 1845b, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4193.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Jenyns 1862</ref>, pp. 201–2 and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6810.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Russell-Gebbett 1977</ref>, pp. 95–6).</note>
