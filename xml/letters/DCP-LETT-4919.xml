<p>I received yesterday your article on Climbers<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; it has pleased me in an extraordinary &amp; even silly manner. You pay me a superb compliment &amp; as I have just said to my wife I think my friends must perceive that I like praise, they give me such hearty doses.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I always admire your skill in reviews or abstracts, &amp; you have done this article excellently &amp; given the whole essence of my paper.— I daresay you are right about the climbing roses; I never thought about spring shoots behaving differently from others.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have had a letter from a good zoologist in S. Brazil, F. Müller, who has been stirred up to observe climbers &amp; gives me some curious cases of <hi rend="underline">Branch</hi>-climbers, in which branches are converted into tendrils, &amp; then continue to grow &amp; throw out leaves &amp; new branches &amp; then lose their tendril character.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am certainly better &amp; have not vomited for above 5 weeks. This is certainly due to not having eaten any thing but toast &amp; meat for the last 2 months. But I cannot recover mental strength &amp; I do no regular work.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have had some flowers crossed for me this summer &amp; have lately been counting seeds.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>You might like to hear that Mitchella behaves exactly like the Cowslip.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Did I ever tell you that a year or two ago I ascertained that Pulmonaria offers a curious case. The long-styled form being absolutely sterile with its own pollen, whilst the short-styled is almost perfectly with its own pollen.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have also ascertained that plants raised from Dimorphic species fertilized by their own pollen, are themselves generally sterile, &amp; are often dwarfs, so that they offer the closest analogy with Hybrids; the first cross &amp; the product both being more or less sterile; this seems to me a very curious fact.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I do not know when I shall be able to publish any of these results, for I have resolved, whenever able to do any thing, to publish my next book.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I have not heard very lately from Hooker, who I believe returns tomorrow to Kew. His illness has been very serious.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> To me the loss of his correspondence has been very great.</p>
<p>My wife has read aloud to me Stephens’s 2 books on Central America.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> What a remarkably pleasant writer he is! &amp; how singularly deficient in the spirit of a naturalist. Who is he &amp; is he still alive<ref target="#foot.f14"/>   we liked his books extremely.</p>
<p>With cordial thanks for all your kindness &amp; you are enough to stimulate a dead man to work.</p>
<p>Yours affect | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The year is established by the reference to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3042.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Gray 1865–6</ref>; see n. 2, below.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD refers to the first of a two-part review Gray had written of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Climbing plants’</ref> in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Science and Arts</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3042.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Gray 1865–6</ref>). The first part of the review was published in September 1865 and the conclusion in January 1866.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Gray described CD’s botanical works as showing ‘a genius for biological investigation, and a power of turning common materials and ordinary observations to high scientific account’, which had not been surpassed ‘since the days of Hunter and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_373.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Bell</ref>’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3042.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Gray 1865–6</ref>, pp. 273–4). Gray referred to the surgeons and anatomists <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2458.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Hunter</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_373.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Bell</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">In his review, Gray noted that CD had difficulty understanding how the shoots of climbing roses could ‘get under a trellis close to a wall’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Climbing plants’</ref>, p. 105). Gray commented that he had observed (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3042.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Gray 1865–6</ref>, p. 282): <quote type="quote"> the strong summer-shoots of Michigan Rose (<hi rend="italic">Rosa setigera</hi> Mx., <hi rend="italic">R. rubifolia</hi> R. Br.), trained on a latticed wall, are strongly disposed to push into dark crevices and away from the light; they would, many of them, pretty surely place themselves under the trellis, and the lateral shoots of the next spring would emerge as they seek the light. </quote> CD added Gray’s explanation in a note to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1458.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Climbing plants</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 184.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD had recently received a second letter from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3070.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Fritz Müller</ref> on Brazilian climbing plants, written after receiving a copy of CD’s <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Climbing plants’</ref> in August 1865 (see letters from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3070.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Fritz Müller</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4881A.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">12 August 1865</ref> and n. 11, [12 and 31 August, and 10 October 1865], and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4885A.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">31 August 1865</ref>; see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4916.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Fritz Müller, 17 October [1865]</ref>). Müller paid particular attention to branch climbers because CD had not observed any among the species he had studied for <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Climbing plants’</ref>. CD added many of Müller’s observations to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1458.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Climbing plants</hi> 2d ed.</ref></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD attributed his improved health to the strict diet recommended by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2601.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Henry Bence Jones</ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4909.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to T. H. Huxley, 4 October [1865]</ref> and n. 3). By ‘regular work’ CD typically meant writing; he was engaged in experimental work at the time (see n. 7, below; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_829.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bowlby 1990</ref>, pp. 378–80).</note>

In 1865, CD conducted crossing experiments with primroses (<hi rend="italic">Primula vulgaris</hi>) and cowslips (<hi rend="italic">P. veris</hi>) grown from seeds he had received from John Scott (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4175.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, [26 July – 2 August 1863]</ref>, and this volume, memorandum from W. E. Darwin, [late February–May 1865], and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4839.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from B. D. Walsh, 29 May 1865</ref>, n. 3). He counted seeds from crosses he made of long-styled purple or red primroses with common wild primroses, and of red cowslips with common cowslips. CD’s notes on these crosses are in DAR 108: 89b–110. He continued crossing experiments on these plants in 1866 and 1867 (notes in DAR 108: 111–24). He reported his findings in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4083.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Illegitimate offspring of dimorphic and trimorphic plants’</ref>, pp. 416–30, and in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, pp. 224–38.</note>
