<p>5. When out of spirits, they evince it in the very same manner as we do.</p>
<p>6. They express contempt by shooting out the lips, and hissing through them, and by turning up the nose. To spit at one, is the highest mark of contempt<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date reflects the minimum time required for Bridges to have received and answered CD’s letter of 6 January 1860. Bridges’s letter, however, could have been written later in 1860 or in 1861. A missionary working with Fuegians, Bridges was based on Keppel Island in the Falklands. The letter was forwarded to CD by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4569.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Waite Hockin Stirling</ref>, the secretary of the Patagonian Mission Society in London (see CD’s annotations).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Cited in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2400.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Expression</hi></ref>, p. 276.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">This information is cited in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2400.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Expression</hi></ref>, p. 318, together with CD’s remark that his own experience of Fuegians during the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> voyage confirmed Bridges’s observations.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Cited in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2400.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Expression</hi></ref>, p. 279.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Cited in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2400.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Expression</hi></ref>, pp. 260–1.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The letter has been cut in two at this point and the two parts subsequently reunited.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">This observation is cited in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 2: 351 n. 62, followed by CD’s comment: ‘I cannot but think that this must be a mistake, unless indeed the statement refers to the few Fuegians who have lived for some time with Europeans, and who must consider us as superior beings.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">The missing section of the letter probably addressed the question posed by CD in his letter of 6 January 1860 relating to the breeding and habits of dogs in Tierra del Fuego. See n. 10, below.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">This remark about dogs was cited in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 39. A second reference to Bridges indicates that the missing portion of the letter contained further information about dogs (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., 2: 207): <quote type="quote"> Hardly any nation is more barbarous than the Fuegians, but I hear from Mr. Bridges, the Catechist to the Mission, that, “when these savages have a large, strong, and active bitch, they take care to put her to a fine dog, and even take care to feed her well, that her young may be strong and well favoured.” </quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">The questions concerned the colour of young pigs and calves in the Falkland Islands. See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2640.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Thomas Bridges, 6 January 1860</ref> and n. 5.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12">This may be the number of one of CD’s portfolios of notes on expression.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f13">The annotations at the end of the letter were duplicated because the letter was at one time cut in two (see n. 7, above). The first remark about Bridges was written on the verso of paragraphs 1–7, which also carries the number ‘29’; the second was written on the verso of paragraph 8. The letter was subsequently glued together again. In 1867, when CD came to work on his notes for <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2400.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Expression</hi></ref>, he attempted to acquire further details about the behaviour of Fuegians from Stirling (see n. 1, above), who was by then the senior missionary on Keppel Island. Stirling was in England in 1866 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5078.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Macdonald 1929</ref>). See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1163.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Calendar</hi></ref> nos. 5330 and 5357.</note>
