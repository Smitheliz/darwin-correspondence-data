        <abstract>
            <p>Has read Dallas’ translation of first part of EK’s essay [on Erasmus Darwin]. Has sent his MS to printer. Is perplexed by duplication. Thinks EK’s essay is better than his. Wishes he had sent all his material to him for a single biography. Best plan may be for EK to incorporate whatever he thinks useful in CD’s material.</p>

                    <p>I received this morning from Mr Dallas a translation of the first part of your M.S.; it seems to me very good, tho’ I have only slightly read it over. Mr Dallas wants much to know, on account of his holidays, when he will receive the second part; so be so kind as to inform us.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>I have this day sent my M.S. to the printers, &amp; they promise that they will soon set up the whole, &amp; when I receive a copy, it shall be sent to you—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am far more perplexed than ever as to what is best to be done. If both the M.S. are printed there will be two distinct biographies of the same man in one volume. I believe that yours is much the best.</p>
                    <p>There would not have been so much difficulty, if your Essay had been left as it first appeared, but I am unwilling to strike out all your biographical part.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I wish that I had sent you all the materials; tho’ there would have been great difficulty in doing this. But as the case now stands, I am almost bound to publish, as so many of my relations have taken trouble to aid me.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>After you have read my uncorrected proof sheets, I shall be anxious to hear what you think will be best to do.</p>
<p>Your best plan would be to intercalate any of my materials which may appear useful to you in your Biography.</p>
<p>I remain my dear Sir | yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
