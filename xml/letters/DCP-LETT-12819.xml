            <p>Surprising thought that diseases of plants should illustrate human pathology.</p>
            <p>Will recommend A. B. Frank’s article in a German encyclopedia, on diseases of plants, to Francis Darwin.</p>
            <p>Gives JP a good case of regeneration in plants – the radicle of the common bean. That plants have little power of regeneration is not difficult to understand by anyone who believes in Pangenesis, "if such a man exists … There is reason to think that my imaginary gemmules have small power of passing from cell to cell."</p>
            <p>Refers to early experiments in which he tried to produce galls in plants by injecting poisons.</p>

                    <p>I am very much obliged for your essay which has interested me greatly.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> What indomitable activity you have! It is a surprising thought that the diseases of plants sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. illustrate human pathology. I have the German Encyclopædia &amp; a few weeks ago told my son Francis that the article on the diseases of Plants would be well worth his study, but I did not know that it was written by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Frank, for whom I entertain a high respect, as a first-rate observer &amp; experimentiser, though for some unknown reason he has been a good deal snubbed in Germany.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I can give you one good case of regrowth in plants, recently often observed by me, though only <hi rend="underline">externally</hi>, as I do not know enough of histology to <hi rend="underline">follow out details</hi>. It is the tip of the radicle of a germinating common bean. The case is remarkable in some respects, for the tip is sensitive to various stimuli &amp; transmits an order, causing the upper part of the radicle to bend. When the tip (for a length of about 1mm) is cut transversely off the radicle is not acted on by gravitation or other irritants, such as contact &amp;c &amp;c, but a new tip is regenerated in from 2 to 4 days, &amp; then the radicle is again acted on by gravitation &amp; will bend to centre of earth. The tip of the radicle is a kind of brain to the whole growing part of the radicle.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>My observation will be published in about a weeks time, &amp; I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have sent you the book, but I do not suppose that there is anything else in the book which would interest you.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>I am delighted that you have drawn attention to galls.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> They have always seemed to me profoundly interesting. Many years ago I began (but failed for want of time, strength &amp; health, as on infinitely many other occasions) to experimentise on plants, by injecting into their tissues, some alkaloids. &amp; the poison of wasps, to see if I could make anything like galls. If I remember rightly in a few cases the tissues were thickened &amp; hardened. I began those experiments, because if by different poisons I could have affected slightly &amp; differently the tissues of the same plant, I thought there w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be no insuperable difficulty in the fittest poisons being developed by insects so as to produce galls adapted for them.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Every character, as far as I can see, is apt to vary. Judging from one of your sentences you will smile at this.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>To anyone believing in my Pangenesis (if such a man exists) there does not seem to me any extreme difficulty in understanding why plants have such little power of regeneration; for there is reason to think that my imaginary gemmules have small power of passing from cell to cell.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Forgive me for scribbling at such unreasonable length; but you are to blame from having interested me so much.—</p>
<p>My dear Paget | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
                    <p>P.S. | Perhaps you may remember that some 2 years ago you asked me to lunch with you &amp; proposed that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> offer myself again, whenever I next come to London, I will do so, &amp; thus have the pleasure of seeing you.—</p>
