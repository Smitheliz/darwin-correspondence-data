            <p>Suggests JSBS’s new machine for observing arterial action be used to test CD’s hypothesis that blushing is caused by thinking intensely about a part of the body and thus releasing the arteries.</p>

<p>I have read the two papers with the greatest interest.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is a grand discovery.</p>
<p>If I understood rightly, you will presently have the machine for enclosing an arm &amp; observing arterial action.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Should you try any experiments with the machine, &amp; if you think the following one worth trying, I should be particularly glad. It is to test (as suggested by my son Frank) my <hi rend="underline">hyperhypothetical</hi> notion on the origin of blushing, namely that thinking intently about any part of the surface of the body tends to relax the arteries in that part.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>You wd probably think of some better scheme than I could; but I may suggest that a man’s arm sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be enclosed &amp; his attention directed intently to his feet; &amp; then that he shd be induced to think as intently as possible about the whole surface of his arm. This might be perhaps best done by some humbug, viz. by asking him to attend to any creeping sensation, or of heat or cold, over the whole surface of the arm, asking him to declare instantly as soon as he felt any such sensation.</p>
<p>Sir H Holland remarked to me long ago, that if you thought intently about any part such as a knuckle or finger, it felt cool as if a breeze were blowing on it, &amp; if my memory does not deceive me, I tried this &amp; found it true..<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
