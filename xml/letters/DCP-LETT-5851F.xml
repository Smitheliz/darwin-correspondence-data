<p>Last August you gave me D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rothrocks address simply “New York”, &amp; to day the letter despatched in September has been returned to me, as “not found”. As I do not like that he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think me uncourteous &amp; ungrateful, will you address &amp; forward the enclosed, though it is not in itself worth sending.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I despatched about 2 or 3 weeks ago the last sheets, Title &amp;c. of my Book. I have become fairly disgusted with it, but yesterday I heard that whole edit of 1500 copies was sold in a week! &amp; a new Edit is to be printed in a fortnight, so urgent is the demand.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Unfortunate people, they clearly do not know what they are eager for. The book has been an immense labour to me &amp; I have the greatest doubt whether it is worth one half or one quarter of the labour. Anyhow it will show the public that I did not speak out without having worked at my subject.— Nearly all the chapters were partially and some fully written before I published the Origin.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> If you can help me about expression, pray give any likely man a reminder.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
