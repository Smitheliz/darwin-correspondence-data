<p>Many thanks for making me F.L.S— I hope there are no red hot pokers &amp; skulls &amp; crossbones at the admittal<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am sorry to see that they are very dawdling about publishing Zoolog: Papers.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Thank you for the Natures<ref target="#foot.f4"/>   I like seeing them very much</p>
<p>Dyer has sent me some Erineum which doesn’t look very hopeful for studying spiral movements, it looks like a mere crustlike lichen growing on a leaf; he doesn’t seem to know much about it but quotes from the Micrograph: Dict that it was thought to be a fungus, but is really an abnormal growth of the epidermis of the trees on which it is parasitic.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Dyer says his life has been a complete scrimmage, &amp; he is just rushing off to examine at Cambridge. When I wrote to thank him I said I was very sorry I had bothered him about the specimens just when he was so busy.</p>
<p>We have had splendid skating here, going on by moon light one night till 8<hi rend="superscript">.</hi>30. We had no snow so it is a delightful clean dry thaw— I and Arthur had a jolly walk yesterday up to the Quarry &amp; saw them loading waggons with the slates M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ruck is selling, he gets about £20 profit from 3 waggon loads; we went through the levels   there are about 400 yds of them.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I hope you are all prospering. | Yrs affec | Frank Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">From 1857, the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> had published separate botanical and zoological journals; by 1876, the botanical journal was being published more regularly than the zoological journal.
