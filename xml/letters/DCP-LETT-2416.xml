<p>I send you some autographs with a list of the men, as you, perhaps, would not know who were who. You will now be well stocked with the autographs of <hi rend="underline">Naturals</hi>.</p>
<p>I made myself very pleasant at home with ghost stories &amp; other plumes borrowed from you.—</p>
<p>I enjoyed my fortnight extremely at Moor Park, but if I were long exposed to the very pleasant temptation of sitting between Miss Craik &amp; you, I wonder what I should not come to believe:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Honeysuckles turning into oaks would be a mere trifle &amp; new species springing up on every Railway embankment.</p>
<p>Will you tell D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lane that I found Etty looking as well &amp; as fat as before her illness.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Pray give my kindest remembrances to all the very pleasant party at Moor Park &amp; believe me with much respect | My dear Miss Butler | Yours Truly obliged | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>Please to tell Lady Drysdale<ref target="#foot.f5"/> that I reached the Station only 14 minutes before the Train started &amp; I should like to know when she will ever have such a triumph as that.—</p>
