<p>I have read your essay with much curiosity &amp; interest, but you probably have no idea how excessively difficult it is to understand.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I cannot fully grasp, only here &amp; there conjecture, what are the points on which we differ.— I daresay this is chiefly due to muddy-headiness on my part but I do not think wholly so.— Your many terms not defined, “developed germs”—“fertile” &amp; “sterile germs” (the word “germ” itself from association misleading to me) “stirp”—“sept” “residue” &amp;c &amp;c quite confounded me.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If I ask myself how you derive &amp; where you place the innumerable gemmules<ref target="#foot.f4"/> contained within the spermatogen formed by a male animal during its whole life I cannot answer myself.— Unless you can make several parts clearer I believe (though I hope I am altogether wrong) that very few will endeavour or succeed in, fathoming your meaning.</p>
<p>I have marked a few passages with numbers,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; here make a few remarks &amp; express my opinion, as you desire it, not that I suppose it will be of any use to you.—</p>
<p>(1) If this implies that many parts are not modified by use &amp; disuse during the life of the individual, I differ widely from you, as every year I come to attribute more &amp; more to such agency.</p>
<p>(2) This seems rather bold, as sexuality has not been detected in some of the lowest forms, though I daresay it may hereafter be.</p>
<p>(3) If gemmules (to use my own term) were often deficient in buds I cannot but think that bud-variations w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be commoner than they are in a state of nature: nor does it seem that bud-variations often exhibit deficiencies which might be accounted for by absence of the proper gemmules. I take a very different view of the meaning or cause of sexuality.</p>
<p>(4) I have ordered Fraser’s Mag. &amp; am curious to learn how twins from a single ovum are distinguished from twins from 2 ova.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Nothing seems to me more curious than the similarity &amp; dissimilarity of twins.—</p>
<p>(5) Awfully difficult to understand.</p>
<p>(6) I have given almost the same notion.</p>
<p>(7) I hope that all this will be altered. I have received new &amp; additional cases, so that I have now not a shadow of doubt.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>(8) Such cases can hardly be spoken of as very rare, as you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> say if you had received half the number of cases which I have.—</p>
<p>I am very sorry to differ so much from you but I have thought that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> desire my open opinion.— Frank is away; otherwise he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have copied my scrawl.</p>
<p>I have got a good stock of pods of Sweet Peas, but the autumn has been frightfully bad; perhaps we may still get a few more to ripen.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The year is established by the relationship between this letter and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10243.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Francis Galton, 5 November 1875</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Galton had sent CD a proof copy of his essay, ‘A theory of heredity’ (Galton 1875b; see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10243.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Francis Galton, 5 November 1875</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Galton used the term ‘germs’ to refer to the hereditary material stored in each organism and transmitted to offspring; he defined ‘stirp’ as the sum total of the germs in a newly fertilised ovum or bud (Galton 1875b, p. 81). According to Galton’s theory, some germs developed, giving rise to all of an individual’s characteristics, such as eye-colour; however, most germs remained dormant. He argued that the developed germs were rendered ‘sterile’ by their activity in the organism, and so exerted little or no influence on offspring; whereas the inactive germs (also referred to as the ‘residual germs’) were concentrated in the sexual elements and transmitted to offspring unmodified (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 82, 88). ‘Septs’ were divisions or aggregations of germs within the stirp (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 89).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">‘Gemmules’ was CD’s term for the material of heredity and development: they were minute granules dispersed throughout an organism and thrown off by its various parts, as well as concentrated in the reproductive organs (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7952.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi> 2d ed.</ref> 2: 374).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">The proof copy of Galton 1875b with CD’s marks has not been found, so that it is not possible to identify what passages CD is referring to.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Galton’s article on twins was published in <hi rend="italic">Fraser’s Magazine</hi> (Galton 1875a). Some of the results of this study are discussed in Galton 1875b, p. 87.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD is probably referring to cases in which injuries to a parent were apparently transmitted to offspring (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10241.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Francis Galton, 4 November [1875]</ref> and n. 4). Galton questioned the evidence for such cases (Galton 1875b, pp. 92–3).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Galton asked CD and other friends to experiment with sweetpeas (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10164.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Francis Galton, 22 September 1875</ref> and n. 6).</note>
