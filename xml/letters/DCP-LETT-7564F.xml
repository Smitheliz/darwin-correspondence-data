<p>Many thanks for yr letter. I am awfully glad about the book £630 is a good lot I suppose<ref target="#foot.f2"/>   I havn’t read the second vol yet, &amp; I havn’t looked about Pouters<ref target="#foot.f3"/> mistake but I shall have more time when I have done dissecting— Pryor says he is sure he can sit on Mivart severely, but I dont know what particular seats he is going to take—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am glad you flummoxed Mivart;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> he is rather absurd about imitations, he cannot see how the rough beginnings &amp; the finishings could come; an animal might start a rough likeness as a defence against one kind of enemy, such as birds perching on trees &amp; dashing off after butterflies— the likeness might be polished up to any extent by the effects of another kind of enemy   About the kangaroos larynx he forgets that marsupials have probably come from Monotremata, in which the milk is made to ooze out by punching the mama’s stomach; when the muscle to the gland began to be developed, it would be feeble &amp; only cause an oozing probably, &amp; with a feeble current of milk, a little sticking up of the larynx wd be of use.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I cant think how he can say that the ancestors of all mammals must have been marsupials or else the progen of marsupials &amp; other mammals must have been an animal having in most respects the ordinary mammalian charactr which certainly an Onithorhynchus has not—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I havnt read the Athenæum,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> which I hear is great book</p>
<p>Salvin is staying with JW, he is a very jolly man<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Mivart argued that CD’s theory could not explain the emergence of various animal structures, such as the baby kangaroo’s elongated larynx, which enabled it to receive milk from the mother without choking (Mivart 1871a, p. 42). As baby kangaroos are unable to suck, milk is injected into their mouths by a muscular movement of the mother’s mamary gland. CD responded to Mivart’s criticism in <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> 6th ed., pp. 189–90; he discussed the origin of mammary glands, using the example of <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus anatinus</hi> (the duck-billed platypus), which has a rudimentary breast, but no nipple. <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus anatinus</hi> is one of the few surviving examples of the order Monotremata (egg-laying mammals).</note>
