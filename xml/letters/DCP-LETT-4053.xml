<p>I have very little to say, but will amuse myself by scribbling a few lines to thank you for information in last note of Feb. 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; to thank you in my dear little man’s name for two precious stamps.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He told me with joyful triumph that in American stamps he equalled all other collections put together in the school. He exchanged a duplicate Blood’s stamp for a whole lot of treasures.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He says there is an envelope of same value as the stamps you put on your letter, which would be of value to him.—</p>
<p>I have one request to make for myself, viz seed of Campanula perfoliata: I have tried in vain at Kew &amp; elsewhere for some.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am very glad you like Bates’ paper;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I expect his Amazonian Travels will be good.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> If you read Lyell’s book, tell me what you think of it;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I (&amp; Hooker) have told him that we regret much that he did not speak more boldly out about Species.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> He answers that his belief in change fluctuates.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> His Book has made me reread your essay; &amp; I admire it as much as ever.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> What a dead hand you are in parrying a lounge &amp; transfixing your adversary! You ask about Sprengels “Dichogamy”:<ref target="#foot.f12"/> he means by this a plant in which each flower first matures &amp; <hi rend="underline">sheds</hi>  its pollen &amp; then has its stigma mature; &amp; much more rarely matures its stigma first &amp; subsequently its pollen: so that these plants are in function monoœcious. I am sure his observations are to large extent correct, &amp; the case is very common.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> In the Primula-like cases the plants are in function Diœcious.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>A couple of days ago I had an interesting letter from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Cruger of Bot. Gardens of Trinidad,<ref target="#foot.f15"/> &amp; he tells me odd facts of native species (&amp; only native species) of Cattleya &amp;c which <hi rend="underline">never</hi> open their flowers, &amp; yet set seed-capsules. Happy man he has actually seen crowds of Bees flying round Catasetum with the pollinia sticking to their backs! I wrote to him to ask him to observe what insects did in flowers of Melastomaceæ;<ref target="#foot.f16"/> he says not proper season yet, but that on one species a small Bee seemed busy about the horn-like appendages to the anthers. It will be too good luck if my study of the flowers in the green-house has led me to right interpretation of these queer appendages.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> By the way, I have just built a hot-house &amp; got some orchids, &amp; it amuses me much.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/> Some plants of Amsinckia spectabilis, at least the seed was so named (small dark orange flowers, elongated hairy leaves) have just begun to flower, &amp; I find in two plants that stigma stands on exact level with anthers; hence I fear they cannot be dimorphic.—<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>Your Mitchellas look healthy: I hope they will not flower very soon;<ref target="#foot.f20"/> for my health (&amp; that of my youngest Boy) has been of late so bad, that we have resolved all to go about middle of April for 6 or 8 weeks to Malvern for Water-Cure for me &amp; change for my Boy.—<ref target="#foot.f21"/> It breaks my heart: I shall never get my present Book on Variation under Domestication finished; yet it interests me much &amp; I am now in middle of long chapter on Inheritance Reversion &amp;c, giving results of my own &amp; other Breeders’ Experiments.—<ref target="#foot.f22"/></p>
<p>Good Night.— | My dear Gray | Yours most truly | Ch. Darwin</p>

These doctrines related closely to CD’s own belief that it was a ‘law of nature … that no organic being self-fertilises itself for an eternity of generations; but that a cross with another individual is occasionally … indispensable’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 97).</note>

In his reply of 29 December 1862 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10), Gray drew on CD’s account of the functional similarity of dimorphic and dichogamous plants, suggesting that CD extend the meaning of the word ‘dichogamy’ to include such cases of dimorphism as that in <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi>.</note>
