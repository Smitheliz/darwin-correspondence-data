<p>You will be surprised to hear that my wife<ref target="#foot.f2"/> and I start on Tuesday next for a four months ramble through France, Italy &amp; Switzerland returning by Rhine if all goes well.</p>
<p>For some time my head has been very shaky, and about two months since I felt it right to have a Medical opinion as to going on working my heart. I was told that I had gone on at least two years too long, that I must cease all work instantly and if possible try the effect of six months rest before deciding whether to give up my app<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> or not.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I had been convinced for some time that there was something wrong about the heart; and the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. said that the fault was there. The action being so defective and the circulation so weak that it did not send blood enough to the brain to nourish it properly.</p>
<p>The Gov<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> very liberally gave me six months leave, and app<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> another officer to do my work for that time. I have been some weeks at Brighton where the Doctor is—and have been waiting in England in hopes of seeing my second boy<ref target="#foot.f4"/> who was returning home after three years in West Indies. He is now paying off at Sheerness and will be home tomorrow—so we shall see him for two or three days.</p>
<p>You will be sorry to hear that Padeby Stewart died at Plymouth last week.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> only three months since I was saying to Usborne<ref target="#foot.f6"/> how very unusual it was to find all our Beagle party (that is the executives) alive and well after 33 years; and now two are gone   Wickham was apparently in perfect health &amp; sitting in the room with his wife when he started up with his hand to his head &amp; fell dead in an instant.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I hope you have kept pretty well lately and that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin and all your party are well.</p>
<p>My wife joins me in very kind regards.</p>
<p>Believe me dear Darwin | Yours very sincerely | B. J. Sulivan</p>
