<p>I have never succeeded in growing Cycnoches.— &amp; I do not recollect ever to have had Mormodes,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> but as this last is one of the aberrant forms of Catasetum, I suspect it follows its habits— You are doubtless aware that Myanthus &amp; Catasetum are <hi rend="underline">identical</hi> though totally unlike.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Twenty years &amp; more ago, I flowered a most beautiful specimen of Myanthus barbatus.—two full spikes of flower, exactly like the plant represented in an early volume of Paxtons Mag<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>It was an <hi rend="underline">imported</hi> plant from Demarara: &amp; I was greatly delighted with it &amp; prized it highly.— Judge of my dismay when the plant flowered the next year, &amp; was a simple &amp; pure Catasetum.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> There could be no mistake for I had no other plant like it. &amp; besides I watched my own plants <hi rend="underline">then</hi> almost day by day.— The transmogrification of that genus is enough to shake my belief in all floral identity.— I regret that I made no drawings of either form—&amp; I cannot recollect any thing definite about the structure of the anther.—</p>
<p>I am spending the winter here &amp; have no access either to my books or my plants—</p>
<p>Soon after I last wrote to you,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> a Catasetum—which had escaped notice up in the roof of my Orchid house flowered, but with only 2 flowers &amp; these had shed their pollen masses before I saw them—so that it was useless to send it to you.—</p>
<p>I wish we were nearer neighbours<ref target="#foot.f6"/> as I should have much pleasure in showing you any thing which I have, though my plants through neglect now of some years standing are not what they once were—</p>
<p>Believe me, Dear Sir | Faithfully yours | John Rogers</p>
<p>PS. | Tropical orchids are very capricious in their growth &amp; often require some slightly peculiar treatment which it is very difficult to find out— One or two species will sometimes flourish, where all others languish, &amp; a slight alteration in the construction of a house will sometimes cause failure where success had previously been uniform—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD was particularly interested in the Catasetidae, which he called ‘the most remarkable of all Orchids’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, p. 211), because their pollinia are violently ejected, thus becoming attached to the insect disturbing the flower. While he had observed this phenomenon in <hi rend="italic">Catasetum</hi>, CD had been unable to obtain mature and undamaged flowers of <hi rend="italic">Cycnoches</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mormodes</hi>, despite many requests to acquaintances (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9 and this volume, second <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3408.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from D. F. Nevill, [before 22 January 1862]</ref> and n. 4).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD had already encountered the remarkable case of trimorphism in <hi rend="italic">Catasetum tridentatum</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3340.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Daniel Oliver, 7 December [1861]</ref>), and he subsequently discussed it in his paper <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7750.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Three sexual forms of <hi rend="italic">Catasetum tridentatum</hi>’</ref>. There he explained that the female and hermaphrodite forms of this species were so different from the male form and from each other as to have been classified in different genera (as <hi rend="italic">Monachanthus viridis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myanthus barbatus</hi>, respectively). <hi rend="italic">Catasetum tridentatum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Monachanthus viridis</hi> are synonyms of <hi rend="italic">Catasetum macrocarpum</hi>, the jumping orchid; <hi rend="italic">Myanthus barbatus</hi> is a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Catasetum barbatum</hi>, the bearded catasetum.</note>
