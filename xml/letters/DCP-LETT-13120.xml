<p>In communicating to you a discovery made by the undersigned, I not only fulfill a duty, but hope to enjoy that humble satisfaction which the awakening interest on your part in one of the most far reaching discoveries of the day, must give to a patient student of Science.</p>
<p>The problem of elementary or original matter from which all substances or materials derive their origin, the force which till the present day has been called Soul, or Spirit, the problem is solved.</p>
<p>I will give my reasons for claiming to have discovered this original or fundamental element. It is generally known under the name Magnetism. This latter element consist of two parts (+ &amp; -) which are inseparable, but which can be concentrated or diffused infinitely, as that no object however small is independent of it.</p>
<p>It is this element which through its power of attraction and repulsion, has not only created all suspended bodies (concentrated) but also moves them, and through its influence so controlls all these bodies that they preserve a perfect equilibrium with one another.</p>
<p>Magnetism is every where.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It is a unity in the Universe, and although its divisibility into molecoles is infinite, there is no object however small which is not subject to a constant polarization, and therefore motion.</p>
<p>I have refrained from naming this magnetic force God, althought it is the Creator, Changer, Resolver of all objects, causes life and perception and eventually destroys all in accordance with simple, natural laws. I leave it to speculative theology to use the element to strengthen, if possible, its faith, and convert to a servant of the Lord, for every master has his servant, why not God?</p>
<p>I would not have ventured to approach you with this communication, if I had not the experience, that Science with but few exceptions, in conjunction with the Press, attempt to smother this discovery by maintaining Silence.</p>
<p>For this reason you will excuse me, If I communicate my discovery to you in this shape but which must offer a strong foundation to your own doctrine.</p>
<p>I send you a few copies of a pamphlet containing in a condensed form my reasons for what I claim, and should you, after its perusal desire to enter more closely into results of my study of magnetism, it would give me great pleasure to communicate them to you.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> For the immediate present, I must await the results which will grow out of this discovery, so that it may not be said as it is so often done, “this we know long ago”.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully Your | Ernst L. Zeuschner. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
