                    <p>I am going to amuse myself by scribbling a bit de rebus scientificibus.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have thought that you might like to read Fritz Muller’s letter. He has sent me seeds— Shall I sow them? By the way I have found the seeds of Dalbergia, which I accused you of losing.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I enclose letters from Hooker &amp; Lawes about the Worms, which I have thought you might like to see: please keep them all..—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have had also an interesting letter from the D. of Argyll, but it is hardly worth taking off the spit.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The worm book is selling well: I heard yesterday that the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> thousand is printing off &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cooke writes that “it is selling like Jack Robinson”.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> We had a very pleasant visit in Cambridge, &amp; every body was most cordial to-wards me, but I saw too many persons &amp; so was rather tired. Bernard was charming on our journey home &amp; sat on my knee conversing, with an old lady, probably a grandmother, listening intently to every word he said.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I have had a long letter from Pfeffer (with his photograph) which I have despatched to Camilla to translate; as we c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> only make out that he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not go on working on the movements of plants., if I intended to do so!!!.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I had a very long talk with Vines (&amp; liked him much). He is not inclined to trust much in Wiesner &amp; says he is finical in his experiments &amp; strongly inclined to oppose everyone. When I told him how I had been vivisected (&amp; recommended him strongly to get Wiesners new book) I saw clearly that he was determined if possible to believe in us.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I discussed with L. Raleigh, George &amp; Horace how to retry some of our experiments, &amp; if you are inclined to try some of them again, I can explain my notions.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I feel pretty sure that Wiesner 〈is〉 wrong in some cases. Some of his views seem to me mere words, such as leaves being at the same time heliotropic &amp; apheliotropic.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> By the way Vines was very much surprised at the behaviour of the roots of Euphorbia when exposed to C. of Ammonia.— He was astonished at the contents of the alternate rows of cells differing in their nature.— He evidently thought the subject worth pursuing. As far as I can yet make out the phenomenon has no connection with the milky juice.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Can you tell me where I can read about the vessels with milky juice? You told me about the tubes going up &amp; down in a marvellous manner.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I have written a very long &amp; cordial letter to Wiesner.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> King of Calcutta says he has despatched a very good specimen in spirits of Dischidia Rafflesiana—which makes pitchers, which catch &amp; drown many ants,, like a Nepenthes. It is a climbing plant like ivy &amp; the strange fact is that it always sends roots from its own stem into its own pitchers into the putrid water.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I have written to Hooker to know whether he knows of anyone who w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be capable of well histo-logising the pitchers; but possibly you might like to undertake the job—<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
                    <p>What a splendid fisher-man you have become.— Your fish was capital eating<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>Goodbye— I am tired | your affectionate Father | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. There has just arrived an Italian pamphlet for you by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Solla</p>
<p>“La Luce e le Piante”—<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>Another letter from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hooker who says why does not Frank undertake Dischidia? He says for years he has wished to see the plant alive, but no one can grow it here.— He has again written to Singapore.<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>

In his book, Wiesner had been critical of some of CD’s experimental protocols, claiming the results in such cases were an artefact of the errors in CD’s methodology (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11461.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Wiesner 1881</ref>, pp. 158–62).</note>

Notes on these species, dated from 28 July to 14 November 1881, are in DAR 62: 2–5, 36–41. One observation that CD mentioned in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13420.xml">letter to J. D. Hooker, 22 October 1881</ref>, was that alternate rows of cells in the fibrous roots reacted differently to immersion in a solution of the chemical, even though they did not appear to differ in external appearance. CD reported his results in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11483.xml">‘Action of carbonate of ammonia on roots’</ref>.</note>

CD hypothesised that there might be a relation between the formation of granules in the cells of roots exposed to carbonate of ammonia and the presence of such vessels or ducts, but eventually concluded this was not the case (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11483.xml">‘Action of carbonate of ammonia on roots’</ref>, p. 245).</note>
