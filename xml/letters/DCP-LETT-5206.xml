<p>I am very proud of your letter—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I thought I might have exaggerated the effect I produced on my audience, &amp; did not like to think too much of it— I do now pray to be another “Single speech Robinson”!<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I wish you could have heard Huxley’s eloge, it pleased me so immensely, &amp; was so much better than all the applause.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I had set my head heart &amp; mind on earning your’s, Groves, Huxley’s, Tyndalls, &amp; the Lubbocks (especially Lady L’!) good opinion, &amp; I cared little for other peoples.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have not seen Tyndall since, nor heard how he liked it.— He came up to me in the forenoon, evidently most anxious for my success, &amp; questioned me about it. When I told him it was a written discourse, &amp; that I intended to <hi rend="underline">read</hi> it, his countenance fell &amp; I saw he was cut.— he turned away first, but came back &amp; with great delicacy &amp; loving kindness gave me some hints; to learn passages by heart &amp;c—(I had done this copiously already) &amp; to put myself en rapport with the audience &amp;c &amp;c. I saw in short that he prognosticated a dead failure, &amp; I spared no pains that afternoon in preparing myself to succeed in his eyes. I hope I did.—</p>
<p>Huxley made a capital President of §D.—&amp; was very conciliatory prudent &amp; amusing too—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I really heard few papers &amp; none of any consequence. Wallaces was no doubt the best in our line.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>As to Grove’s address, I can quite understand your disappointment at the Species part of it—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I only wonder he did it so well, for when I have talked the subject with him, he has shown so little appreciation of its <hi rend="underline">difficulties</hi> that I was rather pleased than otherwise that he thought it needful to discuss it— I knew too that he had left it all to me— indeed he, on accepting the Presidentship, <hi rend="underline">retained</hi> me as champion of the cause.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I wished him at the Devil, but felt flattered at the selection—puzzled as I was then, &amp; am now, to make out why he should have thought me worthy of so responsible a post—on so critical an occasion. I had always a notion that he looked on me as a very weak vessell, &amp; my branches of Botany as mild child’s play. Then too he had no hints or instructions for me   I was to “back him up” &amp; “to carry Darwinism through the ranks of the enemy” after he had sounded the charge: &amp; whether or no his “Continuity” Address<ref target="#foot.f10"/> was well received. In short I was a stink-pot,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> which he was to pitch into the Enemies decks, whether sinking or swimming himself.</p>
<p>The only excursion I went on, was to Belvoir castle, a really grand place, &amp; well worth a visit.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> The pictures &amp; the grounds delighted me.</p>
<p>I am so glad that you are succeeding with Acropera   I should not like you to be beat by any orchid.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>I sent off Seringe to day, &amp; the Drosera shall go soon.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>

He also applauded Hooker’s plan to publish the text of the lecture. For the publication details of Hooker’s lecture, see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5199.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, [28 August] 1866</ref>, n. 3.</note>
