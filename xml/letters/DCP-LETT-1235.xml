<p>As you took such very kind interest about me, &amp; as I owe to so considerable extent my expedition to you, I must report progress. We came here this day fortnight &amp; have got a very comfortable house, with a little field &amp; wood opening on to the mountain, capital for the children to play in.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> We shall stay here at least 2 months, ie to latter end or middle or possibly only to early part of May.— I much like &amp; think highly of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gully. He has been very cautious in his treatment &amp; has even, had the charity to stint me only to six pinches of snuff daily.— Cold scrubbing in morning, 2 cold feet bath &amp; compress on stomach is as yet the only treatment, besides change of diet &amp;c.— I am, however to commence tomorrow a sweating process.— I am already <hi rend="underline">certainly</hi> stronger &amp; perhaps my stomach somewhat better. I was in a much shattered condition before coming here; my hands were becoming tremulous &amp; head often swimming.— I expect fully that the system will greatly benefit me, &amp; certainly the regular Doctors c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. do nothing.</p>
<p>We have a spare bed-room &amp; sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be delighted to see you here, but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> enjoy your visit more towards latter half of April, when I hope to be stronger &amp; less absorbed with my eternal <hi rend="italic">[</hi>short<hi rend="italic">]</hi>, walks bathings &amp;c. all of which make me excessively tired in evening so that I am forced to go to bed at 8<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula>. The only disagreeable part as yet to me, has been the excessive irritation of skin which comes on every evening over whole body.—so that I cannot sit quiet one minute after six or seven oclock.— This no doubt will before long go off. Have you ever been here? It is a curious &amp; nice place &amp; in summer must be very pretty; we have had half our time foggy or hazy, but most fortunate in not having had any rain: I do hope you will come, &amp; that you will find me a ruddy strong man. We have all our servants &amp; governess here.—</p>
<p>My dear Fox | Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
