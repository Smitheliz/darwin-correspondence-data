<p>I am much obliged for your note. The oil-cloth with <hi rend="underline">Bal. crenatus</hi> is very curious, and I would have given a guinea for the specimen 6 weeks ago, before my 2nd vol. was printed off, for it demonstrates what I have printed as my belief, that in Coronula and the Turtle-barnacles,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> the young shell first <hi rend="underline">simply</hi> indents, though surprisingly deeply, (by the gradual growth of the basal edges of the shell), the supporting surface, which at last cracks from being stretched so much, and then the shell continuing to grow outwards and downwards turns up a flap all round. Unfortunately I doubted whether the pressure did not in the case of living supporting animals check the formation of the epidermis, which from seeing your specimen, I believe now to be a superfluous belief.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> On dissolving by acid one of your shells, whilst attached in the very middle, under the basal plate, the same colours, as those all round on the oil-cloth can be seen; and this is the fact which so much interests me. I shall deposit the specimen in the British Museum.</p>
<p>I am extremely sorry to hear of the illness of your children: those fevers are terrible. We had heard how kind you had been to Miss Meek and her sister,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> for which, I am sure, all their friends must feel much obliged to you. I shall come to Liverpool, if I keep well, but my health is <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> fickle:<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I shall have much pleasure in seeing you again.</p>
<p>Till we meet (if I come) believe me yours sincerely | C. Darwin.</p>
<p>P.S. Do take the trouble to read what I have said on the sexual relations of Ibla and Scalpellum;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> the case appears to me very curious.</p>
<p>Would you take the trouble sometime to tell me whether you could help me with the great Balani? I should not want them for 5 or 6 months.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>As I live so retired in the country I am not likely to hear of anyone wanting your House.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Price and CD had been friends and correspondents since their Shrewsbury School days. During CD’s work on Cirripedia, Price had helped him by correcting the Latin descriptions of the species. CD’s Account book (Down House MS) has several entries of payments to Price.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Dated by CD’s reference to planning to visit Liverpool (see n. 6, below) and to having his second volume (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854)</ref>) ‘printed off’. CD recorded completing the final revision of the proofs on 15 July 1854 (‘Journal’; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 5, Appendix I).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Coronula</hi> attach themselves to whales; those of <hi rend="italic">Chelonobia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Platylepas</hi> are generally found embedded in the carapaces of turtles. CD explained the method of attachment of these genera in his descriptions in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854): </ref>135–43, 145–6, and 390–2. Because these parasites were frequently found to be deeply embedded in the skin or carapace of their hosts, some naturalists had supposed they possessed a burrowing mechanism. CD could detect no suitable structure for burrowing in the shell of <hi rend="italic">Coronula</hi>, but for some time he entertained the possibility that the pupa might be able to bury itself deeply. Upon examining a number of specimens still attached to their host, however, he realised ‘that the attachment is as much owing to the upward growth of the whale’s skin, as to the downward growth of the Coronula.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854): </ref>411–12).</note>
