<p>We arrived here last night after a fairly prosperous Journey &amp; having got into a quiet clean little German Hotel we propose remaining en pension for a week &amp; exploring the neighbourhood.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> My wife has been pretty well on the whole. At Dover she did not sleep &amp; she had a bad palpitation &amp;c on ascending the Louvre Stairs.— At Paris we staid a night (good) &amp; took the following <hi rend="underline">night</hi>-express to Basle, where we walked about &amp; proceeded the same afternoon to Zurich by rail without fatigue— There we spent 1<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> days quietly enough with O. Heer,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> an old friend of mine, whose name you know &amp; he recommended us to come here for the rest of our Swiss stay, because of the purity of the air &amp; beauty &amp; interest of the scenery— We accordingly took Rail to Chur (Coir) a most magnificent route, by the Wallen See, &amp; then up the Rhine— At Chur she had no sleep &amp; unfortunately we had to leave by Diligence at 5 next morning for this place, a 15 hours drive.— The first part of the day was intensely hot, the latter, crossing a pass, at 7000 f<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>,—was as cold &amp; a violent fit of Neuralgia was the consequence— We arrived at 8 last night &amp; this morning she is all right again—&amp; will I hope continue so.</p>
<p>The views yesterday were as grand as any thing I have any where seen &amp; except for the little piece called <hi rend="underline">via Mala</hi> on the Splugen, this route beats that hollow,—it is only a few miles East of the Splugen route, of which I caught a glimpse— this, the valley of the Inn, appears to me to combine the beauty of the Tyrol with the savage grandeur of Switzerland in a remarkable degree— In Science I have seen little but Heer’s fossils, he showed me a leaf apparently <hi rend="underline">Dicotyledonous</hi> from the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Lower</hi> Lias in Jura—which please tell Lyell of.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He has a wonderful collection of fossil insects &amp; crustacea from the same, beside which the fossil plants are as nothing, in point of absolute value of characters for systematic determination— I am as always impressed with the identity of physical features &amp; wonderful analogy of <hi rend="underline">biological</hi>, between Alps &amp; Himalaya, the former we can suppose we understand, because physical causes are the same every where &amp; the sequence of these is probably the same in Alps &amp; India— The representation of allied species too we can now (thanks to you) account for largely, but the repetition of forms in plants &amp; animals in no way allied is always a puzzle—especially when accompanied by startling contrasts between allied forms. These latter can best no doubt be accounted for by the <hi rend="underline">indirect action</hi> of physical causes, i.e. Nat. selection &amp; I think there are already many reliable facts to be quoted in illustration of this &amp; that after the <hi rend="underline">course of alternatives</hi> you have administered, I could write a suggestive chapter, comparing the vegetation of Alps Andes &amp; Himalaya, my (never to be begun) book on <hi rend="underline">Plants</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I cannot yet give up my dream of meeting you in Switzerland one day;—if you ever did come here, &amp; I could see you for 5 minutes a day, I should be the happiest man alive. These rocks plants &amp; insects teem with thoughts of you &amp; reminiscences of your writing.</p>
<p>Your Orchid book which I have not read through has suggested to me that Insects &amp;c may have had a wonderful deal more to do with <hi rend="underline">checking</hi> migration than climate or geographics, &amp; that the absence of whole genera may thus one day be accounted for by absence of genera of Insects: in short that the Cat; &amp; Clover story is capable of immediate expansion by any one having sufficient knowledge of Plants Insects &amp; Geography—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I shall be home on 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. so do not write to me. I have seen &amp; heard 0 of Lubbock, Huxley &amp; Tyndall—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>With united regards to you &amp; yours | Ever yr affec | J. D. Hooker.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">No angiosperms had ever been found in rocks older than the Cretaceous system (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 6, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2039.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Charles Lyell, [16 January 1857]</ref>); the Lower Lias is the oldest formation of the Jurassic system. As a long-standing opponent of what he called the ‘Theory of progressive development of organic life at successive geological periods’ (C. Lyell 1853, p. 130), Lyell had rejected the suggestion that the dicotyledonous angiosperms, widely considered to be the most advanced plants, were necessarily absent from the older rocks. While noting the ‘remarkable’ fact that no such fossils had yet been found in the Carboniferous system, he emphasised the great paucity of plant fossils generally from that era. Likewise with the older Secondary rocks he argued that the data were ‘too scanty as yet to affirm whether the vegetation of this second epoch was or was not on the whole of a simpler organization than that of our own times’, and he pointed to ‘the important fact of the co-existence of a large number of angiosperms with cycadeæ’ in the Lower Cretaceous formation (pp. 132–3). However, in noting the absence ‘as yet’ of all signs of dicotyledonous angiosperms from the Jurassic rocks in the fifth edition of <hi rend="italic">A manual of elementary geology</hi> (Lyell 1855, p. 329), Lyell conceded that: <quote type="quote"> The leaves of such plants are frequent in tertiary strata, and occur in Cretaceous, though less plentifully … The angiosperms seem, therefore, to have been at the least comparatively rare in these older secondary periods, when more space was occupied by the Cycads and Conifers. </quote> On Lyell’s non-progressivist views, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_397.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bartholomew 1973</ref>.</note>
