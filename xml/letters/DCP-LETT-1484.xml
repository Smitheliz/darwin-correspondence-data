        <abstract> 
<p>Gratified by what RO says about his book [<hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi>, vol. 1 (1851)]. The anatomical work is the only part he is really interested in; finds the "mere systematic part infinitely tedious"; but will be surprised if he is ever proved wrong on the males of <hi rend="italic">Ibla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scalpellum</hi>.</p>

<p>I will forward by this post the correspondence to Capt. Nelson.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have told him that an abstract will certainly (as I presume) appear which I hope will in some degree satisfy him.—</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how much gratified I am at what you say about the Cirripedia. I really feel rewarded for more labour than you would readily believe it possible could have been bestowed on the work. I have, however, made a mess of it for I got so frightened at the thoughts of all the sessile species, that I have not illustrated &amp; given in nearly detail enough my anatomical work, which is the only part of the work which has really interested me.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I find the mere systematic part infinitely tedious. I can, however, honestly state that all that I have said on the males of Ibla &amp; Scalpellum is the result of the most careful &amp; repeated observations.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> If I am ever proved wrong in it, I shall be surprised.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> But my pen is running away with me,—it is your fault for I have been so much pleased with what you say.</p>
<p>Making out the homologies of the shell &amp; external parts of Cirripedes,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> as I fully believe correctly, (and I am glad to say that Dana admits the view)<ref target="#foot.f7"/> gave me great satisfaction— But I must not bore you with my triumph—</p>
<p>I have been very seldom in London for the last year, when I was last there, I called at the College to see you, but you were just gone out.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Pray believe me in a great state of triump, pride vanity, conceit &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
<p>Yours sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>

In <hi rend="italic">Living</hi> <hi rend="italic">Cirripedia</hi> (1854), however, there is a 120-page discussion of the anatomical characteristics of the Balanidae and illustrations of the larval stages, mouth, thorax, nervous system, and cementing apparatus.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD based his views on the homologies of cirripedes on <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3335.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Henri Milne-Edwards’s</ref> description of the twenty-one segments of an archetypal crustacean (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5457.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Milne-Edwards 1834–40</ref>, 1: 13–14). CD identified seventeen of these twenty-one segments in cirripedes, assuming the four terminal abdominal segments were lacking. This enabled him to make out anatomical features of the Cirripedia which had hitherto been obscure. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851): </ref>25–8, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Appendix II.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1190.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">James Dwight Dana</ref> originally held the view that the peduncle of Lepadidae corresponded to a pair of larval antennae (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1739.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dana 1846</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851): </ref>26 n.). Dana also believed that, analogous to the Crustacea, the inferior pair of larval antennae, rather than the superior, were developed in cirripedes (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1380A.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Dana, [before 29 December 1850]</ref>). CD had apparently convinced Dana that the superior antennae were actually the pair that were developed in the Cirripedia and which later became the prehensile antennae of the adult (see <hi rend="italic">Living</hi> <hi rend="italic">Cirripedia</hi> (1854): 114). Dana presumably also agreed with CD’s view that ‘All that we externally see of a Cirripede, whether pedunculated or sessile, is the three anterior segments of the head of a Crustacean, with its anterior end permanently cemented to a surface of attachment, and with its posterior end projecting vertically from it.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851): </ref>28).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">According to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary, CD was in London from 2 to 5 June 1852, but was unwell for part of the time.</note>
