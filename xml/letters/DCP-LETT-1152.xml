<p>It would give me very great pleasure, if you could spare a day &amp; pay us a visit here. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lyell, Forbes &amp; I hope Owen &amp; Bell<ref target="#foot.f1"/> will come here for a late dinner on Saturday the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; stay till Monday morning. If you can so arrange it, I hope that you will join us.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The best plan of coming here is to leave London Bridge by the 4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. 45’ Train &amp; stop at Sydenham Station &amp; thence take a Fly (if there are 4 of you, the roads are so hilly that it must be a two horse one) to Down.— You will arrive about <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> before seven just in good time for dinner.</p>
<p>Will you be so kind as to show this to Forbes, as I promised to tell him the hour of coming here.</p>
<p>I have not heard yet from Bell; but I believe Owen will come. Might I trouble you for a line in answer</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Will you bring your map of S. America. (if not very large) &amp; we will have a talk over it. Perhaps you had better see first d’Orbigny’s map in Geolog. Soc, without indeed Bone<ref target="#foot.f3"/> has already used his materials.</p>
<p>Tell Forbes to mind that he be not too late for the Train.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Ramsay made the following entry in his diary (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2775.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Geikie 1895</ref>, pp. 130–1) about the visit: <quote> <hi rend="italic">13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> February, Sunday.</hi>— Rose betimes, had a walk in the gardens, and came in to breakfast. Set to work after, and read and thought over Hopkins’s views as shown in <hi rend="italic">Jameson’s Journal</hi>, and when found made a note. After lunch Forbes, Owen, Lyell, and I had a walk in Sir <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3026.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Lubbock’s</ref> park, and saw a number of things pleasant to look upon, in spite of a tendency to drizzling. Nice cosy chat, too, before and after dinner. Darwin is an enviable man—a pleasant place, a nice wife, a nice family, station neither too high nor too low, a good moderate fortune, and the command of his own time. After tea Mrs. Darwin and one of her sisters played some of Mendelssohn’s duets, etc. etc., all very charming. I never enjoyed myself more. Forbes came to my room before going to bed, and gave me a sketch of his coming lecture on generic centres. Lyell is a much more amusing man than I gave him credit for. Mrs. Lyell is a charming person—pretty, lively, and full of faith in, and admiration of, her husband.</quote></note>
