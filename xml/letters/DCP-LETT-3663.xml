<p>My poor Boy rallied last night &amp; is now out of danger. He had recurrent scarlet-fever with every sort of mischief in the glands; &amp; this followed by dreadful erysipelas of head with typhoid symptoms.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The Doctors never saw such a complication of illness. But thank God Port-wine every <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> of hour, night &amp; day, seems to have saved him.</p>
<p>I thank you cordially for taking the trouble of writing at such length: your letter is in many ways of great value to me.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The distinction of the two sorts of Peloria, though so excessively obvious when pointed out, never occurred to me.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I shall now know what flowers to look to. It is quite likely I may make nothing of these peloric gentlemen; but I am contented if I get any result once out of four or five sets of experiments.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Pray give my compliments &amp; best thanks to your Father for his kind information.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The seeds are not ripe, but <hi rend="underline">apparently</hi> I have got some few from a few of the peloric Pelargoniums; but perhaps the seed will prove bad.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Many thanks for references to Bull. Bot. Soc;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> as until within a few weeks I did not see that Peloric flowers would have any bearing on my subjects, I never attended to them. That is a curious case of hereditariness, which you mention: I think Prosper Lucas gives an analogous case.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you are continuing your work on malconformations in Plants.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>With sincere thanks for your valuable aid. Believe me, my dear Sir | Yours sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
