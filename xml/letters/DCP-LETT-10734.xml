<p>I forwarded Balfour’s Certificate to Prof. Ray Lankester as he was with Sir B. C. Brodie, Hawthornden, Torquay.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I signed it myself of course &amp; I hope it has reached you again by this time.</p>
<p>I send you in return Moseley’s Certificate and as I learn from him that you can now sign from personal knowledge I will ask you to put your name as I am sure he would (as I should) like it to stand first in the list of such signatories— Sharpey &amp; Busk I should wish to have as also Carpenter &amp; Wyville Thomson but I will not trouble you for this.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have been intending to ask you for some time back whether you had seen a paper by one of the Smithsonian Institution-Staff, Emil Bessels on the Eskimos <hi rend="underline">die Inuit des Smith-Sundes</hi> in the Archiv für Anthropologie for 1875 B<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. viii. 2. p 111 note &amp; p. 112—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> There are two points given, <hi rend="underline">ll cc</hi> which shew as the author says and more extensively than he means I think <hi rend="underline">eine wirklichen Thierliche Handlung</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Though in no other way <hi rend="italic">[</hi>nice<hi rend="italic">]</hi>, these facts when coupled with such a fact (and I have it from our Deputy for Max Müller the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. G. H. Sayce)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> as that of the Eskimo language being one of the oldest forms of language, &amp; with such another set of facts as the former condition of things in the Miocene period having been what the Germans call Paradisaical &amp; what after such a day as this I should call so too, have I think a considerable significance. I will if you have not the paper at hand, copy the passages &amp; send them to you—</p>
<p>I always feel honoured by any reference you make to me but I cannot think the facts at the bottom of the 469<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. page of the first Volume of your second Edition of “the Variation of Animals under Domestication” are mine— I believe I may have been the first person to draw your attention to Mr Sedgwick’s papers &amp; the little finger’s deformities I have more than once seen hereditarily transmitted though not when artificially produced. These are mentioned on the same page but I have no recollection of the two cases spoken of at the bottom of the page.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
