<p>It has been my desire for some time past, as well as that of my two sisters, to obtain from you, if possible, your autograph, but a lack of courage on my part has prevented the asking of that great favor until now. It is now however for that purpose that I address you, &amp; would respectfully ask if you will be so kind as to <hi rend="underline">write your name</hi> <hi rend="underline">and the date on each of the 3 cards which I beg to enclose herewith</hi>? Will you please do that for us? One is for myself &amp; the others are for each of my two sisters—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>This is the first time I have ever asked for anything of this sort, &amp; have hesitated long before doing so in this instance, but my dear sisters’ frequent &amp; earnest reminders, &amp; my own great desires at last conquered me; hence this letter—</p>
<p>We are fully cognizant of the fact that we are asking a great deal of a gentleman whose time must be as much occupied as yours must be, but we sincerely hope &amp; trust that you will give this request a few moments of your kind &amp; favorable consideration &amp; your compliance therewith.</p>
<p>Both myself &amp; sisters are all ardent admirers of yours, as was my sainted father, which must be our excuse for the making of this request by a youth to a gentleman so much above him— If you will oblige us with the so much desired autograph (&amp; we fervently hope you will) it is our intention to place each of them in handsome little frames and hang them up in our respective rooms where they will always be pleasant to look at as the writing of a gentleman for whom our father’s admiration was so great, &amp; for whom in consequence we cherish such a deep feeling—</p>
<p>In a letter which you sent to a friend of ours some time ago for his collection of letters from distinguished people you signed yourself “Your well-wisher”—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Will you please <hi rend="underline">also add that on each of our</hi> respective cards?</p>
<p>We are <hi rend="underline">especially</hi> desirous of having you add the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">date</hi>. <hi rend="underline">Will you</hi> <hi rend="underline">please not forget that</hi>?</p>
<p>I enclose herewith an addressed envelope for reply—</p>
<p>We shall certainly look anxiously in each incoming mail soon for a reply from you, &amp; sincerely trust you will not allow us to look in vain—</p>
<p>Apologizing for the great liberty I have taken, &amp; with the hope that I may be honored with a reply ere long,</p>
<p>I remain, | Your humble Servant, | James L. Ambrose.</p>
