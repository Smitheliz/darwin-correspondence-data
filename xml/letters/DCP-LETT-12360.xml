<p>I have had a letter marked private from Miss Buckley on the following subject, but please observe that she wishes her name not to be mentioned. She says that Wallace “is not strong &amp; that literary work tires him very much, &amp; the uncertainty of it is a great anxiety to him”. She adds that she knows “that pecuniarily it is of importance to him to get a regular salary”. He lately wrote to her “I want some regular work either partially out-door or if indoor then not more than 5 or 6 hrs a day, &amp; capable of being partially done at home. This I see no probability, hardly a possibility of getting at my age”.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Miss Buckley asks me to consult you, Lubbuck,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; others whether any thing can be done for him. I can see no possibility of obtaining any scientific post for him, with a small regular salary; but it has occurred to me that it might be just possible to get him one of the government pensions. You can judge infinitely better than I can on this head; and will you be so kind as to let me hear what you think. If the presidents of the several leading scientific societies &amp; some dozen other eminent scientific men were willing to sign a memorial stating his claims, Government would perhaps listen to it; especially if any influential man like yourself could say a word in his favour. It seems to me that a fairly strong claim might be made out,— his travels in S. America &amp; the Malay Archipelago for scientific purposes,— his large share in the descent theory,— his grand work on geographical distribution,— Essays on Protection &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If you think at all favourably of the scheme, will you talk it over with any other leading men such as Huxley or Spottiswoode,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> as soon as you meet them. I am in very bad position for doing much, but should feel bound to undertake all the labour, if the plan is considered feasible by you &amp; a few others. I hope &amp; trust that the cause justifies me in troubling you about it.</p>
<p>My dear Hooker | Every yours sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>

While in the Moluccas, Wallace had written an essay on the origin of species through competition for survival and inheritance of useful characteristics and sent it to CD, with the result that CD was convinced to publish his own theory of natural selection, on which he had been working for many years (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1785.xml">C. R. Darwin and Wallace 1858</ref>, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>; see also <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 7).
