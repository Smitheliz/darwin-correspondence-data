<p>In all money affairs it is better to have a memorandum in writing. I thought it so hard a case that your Father should be told that the £200 would be given him &amp; then the offer partially retracted, that I, under these circumstances alone, offered to give the £200, which I have now done:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but I understand that if Miss Davies kept to her original intention, then, as I know perfectly well, you would repay me the £200;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> under any other circumstances, I must freely &amp; cordially give you the £200. This note is ill expressed but is written in a hurry.</p>
<p>My dear Miss Ludwig | yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>

In family letters, the appellation ‘Miss Ludwig’ or ‘Camilla’ refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3035.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Camilla Ludwig</ref>, while ‘Louisa’ or ‘Louisa L.’ is used to refer to her younger sister (<ref target="" resp="#sevans">letter from Emma Darwin to W. E. Darwin, [27 May 1862]</ref> (DAR 219.1: 57)).

CD’s Account book–banking account (Down House MS) records a payment to Miss Ludwig of £200 on 21 December 1862. Next to the entry CD wrote ‘(Class as Invested)’ (square brackets in original). CD’s Account book–classed accounts (Down House MS) records a payment of £10 to ‘Ottocar Ludwig’ on 4 July 1866. ‘Ottocar’ is probably the name of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3035.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Camilla Ludwig’s</ref> father, but he has not been further identified.</note>
