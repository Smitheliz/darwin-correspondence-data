                    <p>Many thanks for all you have done for me.— Keep notes— Why I wish to know about sleeping plants is to give list of Families, as I have observed a good many new cases.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> My Porliera has had no water for some time, but shows no sign of flagging.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have been intending for some time &amp; hope tomorrow to enclose a twig, still on the tree, in bottle with quick-lime, to see effects of locally very dry air.</p>
                    <p>I have been working very hard all the week, chiefly at Thalia, &amp; at last I have made out whole mechanism: it is a wonderful case— the excitement from a touch spreads from 2 filaments over nectar (which filaments are prolongations of a petal or strictly a staminoid) to the pistil, which instantly (certainly as quickly as Dionæa) curls up into a spire, sweeps the bristle to the opposite side of flower, covering it with pollen, &amp; holding it in a special fold or notch. Just as with Catasetum I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> never help jumping when the pollinia were ejected, so here the sudden snap with which the pistil coils up always makes me jump.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have now observed the movements of a score of leaves &amp; of many sleepers, so as to compare the nature of their movements, &amp; it is clear to me that sleep is merely modified circumnutation at a particular time of the day.—</p>
                    <p>You know some leading shoots are always hooked &amp; I have been observing how they straighten themselves: this again is circumnutation with an excess of movement on the under side of the bowed or convex part. Does not Pfeffer call this hynasty &amp; epinasty or some such names? If you can, do talk about this movement of Pfeffer with Sachs;— it does not seem to me to deserve a special name.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>Lastly I have a good case with Acacia retinoides of leaves from which bloom had been removed in February being attacked with black smut.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I hope that you get on with German &amp; profit in many ways from what you see in the Institut.—</p>
                    <p>How nice it will be to have you home again. Bernard is very sweet &amp; pretty.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Ever yours affect | C. Darwin</p>
                    <p>I send Nature<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p> 
                    <p>P.S. Horace suggests that you ask permission to water copiously the plant of Porliera which is out of doors &amp; see if it will then keep awake all day.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p> 
                    <p><hi rend="underline">P.S.</hi> | Very many thanks about Sleepers just received— The great thing is fresh Families. I have a Malvaceous plant, but not genus Gossypium so this w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be valuable fact if it sleeps— Do not waste time abt more Leguminosæ unless you see something remarkable &amp; new—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
                    <p>I do not see that any one (except you occasionally) uses the machine. It is an ugly object in the Smoking Room &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think it a very good thing for me to send it as a present to Sachs   You decide.— I am sure that I shall never endure to have my M.S. copied— Horace does not object to its being given.— All this is written under a mistake— I thought it was <hi rend="underline">Sachs</hi> &amp; I see it is <hi rend="underline">Semper</hi>— Nevertheless I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not at all object to give it to Semper— If you decide so, (I do not care an atom about it) it ought to be cleaned &amp; despatched &amp; packed by makers<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
