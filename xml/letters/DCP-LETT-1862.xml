<p>As I sent you a list of the land-shells picked up at Down when we were last there<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I wish you, in case you have kept it to put ?? to Helix carthusiana which I still think is among them— But the shell which I meant by that name is I find called by Forbes &amp; Hanley Helix Cantiana Mont. as being the prior name—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> In my own list &amp; perhaps in the one I sent you I find I had added this name of Montagues<ref target="#foot.f3"/> as a synonym—, for I had made no mistake about the species which I meant—</p>
<p>I also find amongst them another shell which I suppose to be Helix rufescens? and the Bulimus which I left unnamed must I think be B. obscurus— The Clausilia which I called C. plicatula ought to have been C. nigricans, according to Forbes &amp; Hanley.</p>
<p>I have met with such a remarkably conical variety of Helix aspersa from Charing Kent, in Woodward collection<ref target="#foot.f4"/> that I cannot regard that shell as quite so constant in England as I told you—&amp; as it is reputed to be. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to show it to you as I have got this variety</p>
<p>I have just heard from Woodward that his friend M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C. Prentice of Cheltenham caught that large &amp; most powerful of our water beetles Hydrobius piceus with an ancylus fluviatilis adhering to him! &amp; treating him as he would a stone after the beetle was out of the water.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Here is a new light as to the way by which these sedentary mollusks may get transported from one river basin to another— That species of Ancylus seems to have got into Madeira before Man—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> How far can an Hydrobius fly with a favourable gale?</p>
<p>I hear that when you &amp; Hooker &amp; Huxley &amp; Wollaston got together you made light of all species &amp; grew more &amp; more unorthodox— <ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Heer of Zurich has given us a capital essay on the old Atlantis in a new paper just out on the fossil leaves of Madeira— <ref target="#foot.f8"/> When I go abroad I will lend it to you for now I am always using it.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> He makes out a good case in favour of the old union provided one believes in specific centres. According to any other hypothesis I cannot as yet very well see how to bring the geograph<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>. facts to bear one way or the other— I wish you would publish some small fragment of your data <hi rend="underline">pigeons</hi> if you please &amp; so out with the theory &amp; let it take date—&amp; be cited—&amp; understood. <ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>With my love to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin &amp; the children ever truly Y | Cha Lyell</p>
<p>To encourage you to get up J. E. Gray’s subdivision of the Genus Helix I may mention that Macandrew brought back from the Salvages a Helix allied to (some think only a var of) Helix pisana a British species<ref target="#foot.f11"/> it was named by some one H. Macandrei &amp; by Lowe who had received it first H. ustulata—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Gray enters into his catalogue diag Nanina ustulata Salvages</p>
<p>N—— Macandrei d<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>—ramme making two species, &amp; on being asked why he called them Nanina said, because it is the form which belongs to islands in the <hi rend="underline">Pacific</hi>! He had imagined the Salvages to be in the Pacific otherwise he should have certainly had some other subgenus assigned to it—! some Atlantic genus of Helicidæ!<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>May 2. This letter was not posted yesterday by accident. I went to see poor Curtis the entomologist who being nearly blind by amaurosis was run over 10 days ago by three Cabs &amp; broke a shoulder bone but is doing surprisingly well.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>He told me that a french entomologist brought him a Dytiscus marginalis the large water beetle (which flies about freely) with a small bag of eggs of a water spider under his wings, evidently put there by the parent. It was not a parasitic insect which had done this— He could not look up the case because of his illness &amp; blindness but some day I will get it perhaps—</p>
<p>What unexpected means of migration will in time be found out—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>The multiple creation of Agassiz will one day rank with spontaneous generation but Madeira seems to me to favour the single specific birth-place theory &amp; I long to see your application of any modification of the Lamarckian species-making modification system— Representative forms in closely adjoining islands are great puzzles where the conditions are one would think so nearly the same—<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>

Lyell had evidently heard about the weekend discussions from Hooker and Huxley, for he recorded other remarks from them about species in his ‘Scientific journal’ (Wilson ed. 1970, pp. 56–7). In a letter of 30 April 1856 to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_722.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles James Fox Bunbury</ref>, Lyell stated: ‘When Huxley, Hooker, and Wollaston were at Darwin’s last week, they (all four of them) ran a tilt against species farther I believe than they are deliberately prepared to go. Wollaston least unorthodox. I cannot easily see how they can go so far, and not embrace the whole Lamarckian doctrine.’ (K. M. Lyell ed. 1881, 2: 212). CD made notes, dated 28 April 1856, on his conversation with Wollaston. These are preserved in DAR 197.2, together with further notes dated 8 May 1856. In a letter to Lyell dated 12 May 1856 (F. J. Bunbury ed. 1891–3, <hi rend="italic">Middle life</hi> 2: 391–2), Bunbury expressed surprise that Hooker was unorthodox and commented: <quote> Darwin goes much further in his belief of the variability of species, than I am disposed to do, but even he, I imagine, would not assert an <hi rend="italic">unlimited</hi> range of variation: he would hardly, I conceive, maintain that a Moss may be modified into a Magnolia, or an oyster into an alderman; though he seems to hold that all the different forms of each natural group may have sprung from an original stock, even (for instance) that the Ericas of Europe and of the Cape may have had a common origin: which I am not disposed to believe.</quote></note>

He had sent Lyell his paper (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3481.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Heer 1855</ref>) on the fossil plants of Madeira (see K. M. Lyell ed. 1881, 2: 210–11). To account for the similarity in flora between Madeira and Europe, Heer had suggested that Madeira was at one time connected to Europe and North America. Lyell also entertained the possibility that a land-bridge had previously connected Madeira and Europe (see K. M. Lyell ed. 1881, 2: 212, and Wilson ed. 1970, pp. 92–3).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f10">During Lyell’s visit to Down in April, CD had told Lyell about his theory of natural selection as a mechanism for species change. Although Lyell had long known about CD’s investigation of the species question, there is no evidence that CD had communicated the substance of natural selection before this date. Lyell’s notes on this conversation, dated 16 April 1856 and headed ‘With Darwin: On the Formation of Species by Natural Selection’, cited, among other things, the example of pigeons. He wrote: ‘The young pigeons are more of the normal type than the old of each variety. Embryology, therefore, leads to the opinion that you get nearer the type in going nearer to the foetal archetype &amp; in like manner in Time we may get back nearer to the archetype of each genus &amp; family &amp; class.’ (Wilson ed. 1970, p. 54). In a <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Bunbury, 30 April 1856</ref> (see n. 7, above), Lyell again discussed pigeons in connection with CD’s transmutation theory: ‘Darwin finds, among his fifteen varieties of the common pigeon, three good genera and about fifteen good species according to the received mode of species and genus-making of the best ornithologists, and the bony skeleton varying with the rest!’ (K. M.
