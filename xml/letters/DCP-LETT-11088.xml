<p>Sends thanks for a newspaper abstract; will be pleased to see the paper [probably "Economy as a phonetic force", <hi rend="italic">Trans. Am. Philological Assoc.</hi>8 (1877): 123–34] when printed.</p> 
            <p>Sends his own ["Biographical sketch of an infant"], saying it is of little value, the observations having been made before recent advances in philology.</p>

The newspaper abstract that was forwarded to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4195.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Archibald Henry Sayce</ref> has not been identified, but was evidently a report relating to the 10 to 12 July 1877 meeting of the American Philological Association in Baltimore (for a full report of the meeting, see <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the American Philological Association</hi> 8 (1877): 3–39). After reading CD’s article <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8641.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Biographical sketch of an infant’</ref>, Sayce had written to CD to ask for information on sounds made by infants (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11074.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from A.

Two papers read at the Baltimore meeting concerned language acquisition in children (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10269.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Holden 1877</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10268.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Whitney 1877</ref>).</note>
