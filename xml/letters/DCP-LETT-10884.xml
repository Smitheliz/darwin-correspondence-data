<p>Thanks MN for essay ["Die Congerien", <hi rend="italic">Abh. Geol. Bundesanst. Wien</hi> 7 (1875)]. It is the best case CD has met, showing "direct influence of conditions of life on the organization". A. Hyatt has come to same conclusion: that closely similar forms may be derived from distinct lines of descent. CD did not emphasise in <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> the direct action of environment on modification of species; most of the best evidence has been observed since its publication.</p>

<p>From having been obliged to read other books, I finished only yesterday your essay on “Die Congerien &amp;c”.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I hope that you will allow me to express my gratitude for the pleasure &amp; instruction which I have derived from reading it. It seems to me to be an admirable work; &amp; is by far the best case which I have ever met with, shewing the direct influence of the conditions of life on the organization.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hyatt, who has been studying the Hilgendorf case, writes to me with respect to the conclusions at which he has arrived, &amp; these are nearly the same as yours.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He insists that closely similar forms may be derived from distinct lines of descent; &amp; this is what I formerly called analogical variation.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> There can now be no doubt that species may become greatly modified through the direct action of the environment; I have some excuse for not having formerly insisted more strongly on this head in my Origin of Species, as most of the best facts have been observed since its publication.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>With my renewed thanks for your most interesting essay; &amp; with the highest respect, I remain | dear Sir | yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>

We can also understand the apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared one with another.</quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD was sceptical about ‘direct action of the environment’ contributing to evolutionary change, but he recognised it as a more potent force in the development of the individual organism.
