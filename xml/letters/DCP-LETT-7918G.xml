                        <p>I cannot thank you enough for your letter of Aug 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, which, even if I had not wished much to learn something about the pedicillariæ, would at any time have interested me beyond measure.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is a splendid case of gradation of structure. I wish extremely I could give the whole of the case, but this is impossible from want of space, even if I had the requisite knowledge to do it well; but I must give some of your conclusions &amp; remarks.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Over &amp; over again I have come across some structure, &amp; thought that here was an instance in which I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. utterly fail to find any intermediate or graduated structure; but almost always by keeping a look out I have found more or less plain traces of the lines through which development has proceeded by short &amp; easy &amp; serviceable steps. Rarely, however, have I learnt so fine an instance as this of yours.— I have been very unwell for the last 5 weeks with giddiness &amp; horrid head feelings &amp; have done <hi rend="underline">nothing</hi>: I was not able to read your letter at one time, but now I have <hi rend="underline">just</hi> finished it, &amp; it has served as a more splendid stimulus than any physic, &amp; has enabled me to write myself this note.</p> 
                            <p>Accept my cordial thanks, &amp; believe me | yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
                            <p>I am very much obliged for the beautiful book, “Sea-side Studies”, which I will read as soon as my odious head allows me to read anything.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
