            <p>Carlyle hoped CD had not been annoyed by that forged letter, which was the reverse of his opinion. [Enclosed is a published extract, said to be taken from a Thomas Carlyle letter, which denies CD’s intellect and regrets his influence.]</p>

Ah, it’s a sad, a terrible thing to see nigh a whole generation of men and women professing to be cultivated, looking around in a purblind fashion, and finding no God in this universe. I suppose it is a reaction from the reign of cant and hollow pretence, professing to believe what in fact they do not believe. And this is what we have got to. All things from frog spawn; the gospel of dirt the order of the day. The older I grow—and I now stand upon the brink of eternity—the more comes back to me the sentence in the Catechism which I learned when a child, and the fuller and deeper its meaning becomes—‘What is the chief end of man? To glorify God and enjoy him for ever.’ No gospel of dirt, teaching that men have descended from frogs through monkeys, can ever set that aside.’</hi></p>

That the faith in which he was nurtured at his mother’s knee in the old Dumfriesshire home has not lost its hold upon Mr Carlyle, is made abundantly obvious from such words as these:—</quote></note>

The man and his books</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10179.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wylie 1881</ref>, pp. 328–9). Wylie reported that the so-called letter was actually an account of a conversation Carlyle had had with an American visitor, and that, in spite of the denial in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, which Wylie described as having been written by ‘Mr Lecky, the historian’, the account was verified by other witnesses to the conversation. Another version of the account, citing it as ‘remarks addressed to a visitor’, appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi>, 12 February 1881, p. 245.</note>
