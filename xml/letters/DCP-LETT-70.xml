<p>I returned from Black Game shooting at Maer on Monday, &amp; was most exceedingly glad to find your letter, when I came home: I am very much obliged for your most kind &amp; welcome invitation to Osmaston. And, as by good luck your visit into Yorkshire has been delayed, if it will suit you, I will come there early in September.— I intend going to Maer for the first, &amp; shall stay there about a week, after which I will come through Newcastle to Derby.— I will write &amp; let you know when I can find out about coaches &amp;c &amp;c</p>
<p>But first, to know whether it is perfectly convenient I must have a letter directed to me at J. Wedgwood Esq. Maer Hall <hi rend="underline">Newcastle</hi> <hi rend="underline">under</hi> <hi rend="underline">Line</hi>. You must write nearly as soon as you receive this.—</p>
<p>I am afraid it is almost too late for Entomologizing, but I shall like a quiet week at Osmaston better than anything else: I had so very pleasant a visit the last time I was there; that every thing has a charm to me from Pig Park to your’ Sanctum Sanctorum.—</p>
<p>The Wedgwoods<ref target="#foot.f1"/> whom you saw at Kingscote are staying at Maer. they have been for the last year living with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Sismondi<ref target="#foot.f2"/> near Geneva &amp; there they saw the Ways who have a house there.— They did not see little Albert. his direction is Les Dèlices,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Près de Genève.— If you have any virtue &amp; are not <hi rend="underline">too much</hi> engaged, you will of course immediately write to him.—</p>
<p>You will be surprized to hear that I have been again to Barmouth. my sisters took a sudden freak<ref target="#foot.f4"/> to go to the sea-side so I chaperoned them there. The weather was dreadfully bad so I did not do much amongst the beetles.— We will work gloriously, when I am at Osma〈ston.〉 I shall extremely like going regularly through your collection, &amp; I think I shall be able to name a good many.— I will bring you the duplicates of this summer work, such as they are.—</p>
<p>My Father of course meant to send the Martens as they were as I also did the Dundiver, and we are glad they arrived safe.— My Father is glad to hear that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin is tolerably well: it must have been a terrible blow to her.—</p>
<p>The Owens of Woodhouse, the idols of my adoration, have been staying at Buxton, &amp; are now returned for the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> of September. They give a most amusing account of the state decrepitude to which the Beau Garcons are there reduced.—</p>
<p>But if I begin to talk about Woodhouse &amp; la belle Fanny, I never shall conclude this letter, so believe me my dear Fox, Yours sincerely | Chas. Darwin</p>
<p>My Father sends his best regard to you.— Be sure write soon, &amp; direct to Maer.</p>
