<p>I am afraid my answers are this time not satisfactory; but it is all I can give, and do not know where else I could steal for you.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I was very sorry to hear that you are very unwell; all I can say is “do not work”. You can be satisfied with having set the stone rolling; it will find its proper road whether you try to push it right or left, or whether you leave this part of the business to Messrs Mivart &amp; Wright. Surely the latter cannot be a naturalist! Have you another copy to spare of Wright’s pamphlet, I gave mine to a friend who does not return it.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am going to Oxford tomorrow for a few days to see what I can do for their collection of Reptiles.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>If you know Dr. Murie, ask him for a copy of his restoration of Sivatherium. It will amuse you. There is so much poetry &amp; artistic skill in it that I shall have it framed.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am hard at work at—alas—many things; but my chief work is continuing the examination of <hi rend="underline">Ceratodus</hi>. I have now made out, that it not only has the sexual apparatus of a tailed Batrachian, but also invests its eggs with a glutinous substance as a frog or Salamander.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>With kindest regards | to Mrs Darwin | Yours most truly | A Günther</p>

<p>1, I have not seen the paper on the distribution of nerves in the ear of the Mouse. When I find it, I will let you know, although I am afraid it will be too late for your purpose.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>2, There is no Rodent with a <hi rend="underline">structurally</hi> prehensile tail, more nearly related to <hi rend="underline">Mus</hi>, than <hi rend="underline">Synetheres</hi> (<hi rend="underline">Cercolabes</hi>). But it may be of interest to you that several species of <hi rend="underline">Mus</hi> have a <hi rend="underline">functionally</hi> prehensile tail. I have seen only the other day some living specimens of the Harvest-Mouse (<hi rend="underline">Mus minutus</hi>) in the possession of Prof. Maskelyne. In climbing up vertical reeds, or in moving from one reed to another they use their tail as much as if it were a truly prehensile organ; they wind it round a vertical or horizontal stem, suspend themselves by means of it, but they do not seize an object, except for the purposes of locomotion or sustaining themselves in a certain position.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>3, I know that Dr. Murie makes an Eland of the <hi rend="underline">Sivatherium</hi>; &amp; he will shortly publish a restored figure of it which gives it a broad, long muzzle, like that of the Eland, but not a proboscis.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Macrauchenia has no proboscis, according to the best authorities<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>4, That Galaxias goes down to the sea, is extremely improbable. Of the thousands of fishes received from the Southern Pacific, not one was a Galaxias; whenever <hi rend="underline">Galaxias</hi> was sent, it was sent with other freshwater-forms. In the numerous letters I have received from Tasmania, Australia &amp; New Zealand regarding these fishes, they were always described as truly Freshwater-forms; nothing was ever said or written about their having been met with in the sea.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Yet they are as well known to the colonists as the Trout in Europe. I cannot add anything more than what you find in the Catalogue, with regard to their distribution.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> However, the case of <hi rend="underline">Galaxias</hi> is somewhat strengthened by two well-marked forms of Lampreys being found in Australia &amp; S.W. America. I can vouch for the correctness of the localities, as it has been confirmed over &amp; over again.</p>
<p>a. <hi rend="underline">Mordacia mordax</hi> distinguished by a most formidable dentition is found at Valparaiso and Tasmania (Catal. Fish. VIII. p. 507)</p>
<p>b. <hi rend="underline">Geotria chilensis</hi> from Chile, New Zealand and Swan River (ibid. p. 509).<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Now, you will say the Lampreys enter the sea; nevertheless, it is also true that they do not go far from the mouth of the river which is their true home &amp; place of birth. They are among the very worst swimmers, &amp; to account for their passage across the Pacific, you must assume that they attached themselves to other fish which carried them across. They could not have <hi rend="underline">gradually</hi> made their way across, as they do not spawn in the sea, but in rivers; &amp; their spawn could not live in seawater.</p>
