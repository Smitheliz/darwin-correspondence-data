<p>Thank you very much for your letter.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I must own it has discouraged me a good deal as to the necessity of steel traps.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I believe you are the only person in England who has energy &amp; humanity to visit the traps at midnight &amp; Charles tells me you once carried a toad over the Menai Bridge for fear he should come to a bad end—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I want to ask you to do me a favour. My game keeper friend<ref target="#foot.f4"/> here who is so smooth spoken I suspect he chiefly tells me what he thinks I want to hear, tells me that the animals almost always break the leg in their first frantic efforts to escape— is this true according to your experience?<ref target="#foot.f5"/> But I want you to be so kind as to have a trap wound round with cloth or flannel over the iron teeth so as to see whether it will save much suffering to have the leg only pinched instead of torn with the teeth. I thought if it is true that the leg is broken the animal would suffer nearly as much in whatever way it is held fast.</p>
<p>I am going to send out papers for subscriptions &amp; when I have got as many names as I can I must put it into the hands of the Soc. in Pall Mall, as the awarding the prize will be a difficult matter.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I send you a paper to shew what sort of a beginning we have made &amp; I am more grateful for two 5<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>/ subscriptions than one at £1, for I think the number of names who take an interest in the attempt is what chiefly signifies<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I can give rather a better account of Charles this week but he is never long without attacks of sickness. The water cure seemed to do him harm &amp; D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gully quite owned that he was not strong enough to bear it<ref target="#foot.f8"/>   Since we came home he has consulted D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brinton of Guy’s Hospital &amp; I hope mineral acid is doing him some good<ref target="#foot.f9"/>.</p>
<p>He is wonderfully cheerful when not positively uncomfortable   He does not feel the least temptation to disobey orders about working for he feels quite incapable of doing any thing.</p>
<p>His good symptoms are losing <hi rend="underline">no</hi> flesh &amp; having a good appetite so that I fully hope that in time he will regain his usual standard of health which is not saying much for him. He desires me to remember him most kindly to you &amp; with my very kind remembrances to Mrs Fox<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I am dear Mr Fox yours very sincerely | E. Darwin</p>
<p>I will trouble you with the new paper when it is printed.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I wish you had told us how you are yourself</p>

There is an entry in CD’s Account books–banking accounts (Down House MS) recording the receipt of a subscription towards funding a prize for the design of a humane trap for the destruction of vermin (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, Appendix IX).</note>

CD had formerly received hydropathic treatment from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2020.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">James Manby Gully</ref> at Great Malvern, Worcestershire, but was treated on this occasion by Ayerst, presumably on the recommendation of Gully, owing to Gully’s own ill health (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4178.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from W. D. Fox, [16–22 May 1863]</ref>, and letters to W. D. Fox, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4181.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">23 May [1863]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4292.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">4 [September 1863]</ref> and n. 1).</note>
