<p>I am heartily obliged for your present, but hardly feel worthy of it. I was so very much interested by many things which you told me, that you may be sure I shall read your Lectures;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but I shall not be able very soon, as I have several big borrowed books, which must be returned soon. Will you be so very kind as to remember me, if anything occurs to you, in regard to inheritance at <hi rend="underline">corresponding or rather earlier</hi> ages; &amp; in regard to constitution &amp; complexion.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I wish I could give you any facts on your Chronometry of Life;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am sure I have often met with striking facts; but I have disregarded such facts &amp; <hi rend="underline">deviations</hi> alone would have struck me.</p>
<p>You know of course that the same bird in state of nature further S. or N. lays eggs at different times; &amp; not rarely 2 broods in the S. &amp; only one in N. The degree to which they sit, varies under different temperatures; but I do not mean by this that eggs hatch at different periods.— Some Batrachians of same species are oviparous or ovoviviparous under different climates. The periodical shedding of wool in sheep is no doubt affected by tropical climate. The appearance of second teeth has been greatly affected &amp; accelerated in our domestic quadrupeds. Certain breeds of fowls, acquire their perfect plumage slower than others, so that after the down they are apt to be almost naked.</p>
<p>I see Youatt does not seem to doubt that period of breeding has been accelerated with the general early maturity of our improved cattle.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Tessier gives 321 days as longest period &amp; 240 as shortest period of gestation in cattle.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I do not suppose these rough remarks will be of any interest to you, but I send them for mere chance</p>
<p>Pray believe me, with very many thanks | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>Cocks can be distinguished from Hens, earlier in some breeds than others.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">It is not known what present Paget had given CD. The discussion that CD refers to may have taken place at the 16 December 1858 meeting of the Philosophical Club of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4110.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Royal Society of London</ref>, which CD and Paget both attended (see Royal Society, Philosophical Club minutes). The ‘Lectures’ were probably Paget’s <hi rend="italic">Lectures on surgical pathology</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6139.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Paget 1853</ref>). There is a heavily annotated copy of the first volume of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6139.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Paget 1853</ref> in the Darwin Library–CUL (see <hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi> 1: 658–61); it is not inscribed, so it is unlikely to have been the ‘present’ that CD refers to. Volume 1 of the two-volume work dealt with hypertrophy, atrophy, repair, inflammation, mortification, and specific diseases; volume 2 dealt with tumours. CD read the first three chapters and the last chapter of the first volume in early 1859 (see CD’s reading notebooks (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 4, Appendix IV, 128: 24), and his annotations in the back of the volume at CUL).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Paget delivered his lecture ‘On the chronometry of life’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6141.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Paget 1859</ref>) at the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_7845.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Royal Institution of Great Britain</ref> on 8 April 1859. The lecture was intended ‘to illustrate the law that the processes of organic life are regulated with a regard to time, as exact as that which is observed by them in respect of size and weight and quantity of material employed in them’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6141.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Paget 1859</ref>, p. 117).</note>
