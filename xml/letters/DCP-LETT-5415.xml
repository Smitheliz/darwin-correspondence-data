<p>I much regretted that I was unable to call on you, but after Monday I was unable even to leave the house.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> On Monday evening I called on Bates<ref target="#foot.f2"/> and put a difficulty before him, which he could not answer, and, as on some former similar occasion, his first suggestion was, “You had better ask Wallace.” My difficulty is, why are caterpillars sometimes so beautifully and artistically coloured? Seeing that many are coloured to escape danger, I can hardly attribute their bright colour in other cases to mere physical conditions. Bates says the most gaudy caterpillar he ever saw in Amazonia (of a Sphinx) was conspicuous at the distance of yards from its black and red colouring whilst feeding on large green leaves.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If anyone objected to male butterflies having been made beautiful by sexual selection, and asked why should they not have been made beautiful as well as their caterpillars, what would you answer? I could not answer, but should maintain my ground.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Will you think over this, and some time, either by letter or when we meet, tell me what you think? Also, I want to know whether your <hi rend="underline">female</hi> mimetic butterfly is more beautiful and brighter than the male?<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>When next in London I must get you to show me your Kingfishers.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>My health is a dreadful evil; I failed in half my engagements during this last visit to London.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Believe me, yours very sincerely, | C. Darwin.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In a note dated 18 February 1867, CD wrote that Bates had observed a caterpillar of the sphinx moth (family Sphingidae). CD had been considering this general question as early as 1861 (see DAR 81: 5). CD discussed colourful caterpillars and gave more detail of Bates’s observation in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 1: 415–16. Wallace and Bates had travelled together in the Amazon River basin (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2063.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">For CD’s interest in sexual selection, see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5410.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Fritz Müller, 22 February [1867]</ref> and n. 8. See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5374.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Alfred Newton, 21 January 1867</ref> and n. 8. The first extant letter from CD to Wallace concerning CD’s belief in the importance of sexual selection is the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4510.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to A. R. Wallace, 28 [May 1864]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 12).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5280.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter of 19 November 1866</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 14), Wallace told CD that he had a metallic-blue female <hi rend="italic">Diadema</hi> that mimicked a metallic-blue <hi rend="italic">Euploea</hi>; he also wrote that the male <hi rend="italic">Diadema</hi> was dusky brown. In his paper ‘On reversed sexual characters in a butterfly’ (A. R. Wallace 1866a, p. 186), Wallace suggested the name <hi rend="italic">Diadema anomala</hi> (now <hi rend="italic">Hypolimnas anomala</hi>, the Malayan eggfly); he pointed out that it was the female of the species that mimicked the male <hi rend="italic">Euploea midamus</hi> (blue-spotted crow). CD mentioned the case in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 1: 413. CD also discussed mimetic butterflies with Wallace when he was in London later in November 1866 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5371.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Alfred Newton, 19 January [1867]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD and Wallace evidently had a discussion on the differences between the sexes in kingfishers when CD was in London in November 1866 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5517.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to A. R. Wallace, 29 April [1867]</ref> and n. 6). In 1862, Wallace had returned from eight years in the Malay Archipelago and had since organised his extensive collections (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 12, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4378.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from A. R. Wallace, 2 January 1864</ref>, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8126.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. R. Wallace 1905</ref>, 1: 385–405). Wallace’s kingfishers were displayed in his Bayswater exhibition (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5634.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from A. R. Wallace, [19 June 1867]</ref> and n. 3, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8126.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. R. Wallace 1905</ref>, 1: 404).</note>
