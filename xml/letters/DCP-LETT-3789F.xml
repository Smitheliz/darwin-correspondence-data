<p>I have got the Lythrum, and send it you in 3 different envelopes to prevent mistake. I was in a great fright that I should not be able to get any short P. as I went one day, and could not find any tho’ I hunted most carefully. I suppose it had all been gathered as I found plenty of broken stems, but I found 2 or 3 plants of both L.P. and MP. so I went next day, and had another hunt, and at last found a plant marked: it unluckily did not grow in a clump with the other sorts but by itself.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have got branches of all three sorts, if you want any thing done in the way of counting. The S.P. are not quite so ripe as the others, but I dare say they will do.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>What horrid bore your exzema has prevented your going to Cam.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I want to know what you think about this frog discussion for Sanders, as he has been having a battle with Sir H. James about them.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Sir H. says there is not the slightest doubt that frogs have been found in stones, or coal &amp; he explains it by saying that the spawn has got in through a crevice, and that the frog has been bred there, and lived years perhaps; Sanders holds out that the whole thing is humbug.</p>
<p>I have got to shew the Burnaby’s<ref target="#foot.f6"/> my microscope, so I should most obliged if you would send me 6 or so of your best objects   I send a little case in which they will travel perfectly safe and please tell me anything you can think of I can catch or find to shew them.</p>
<p>You all seem very jolly and well which is a good job. I dont know whether I shall get to Down before Christmas but I shall see.</p>
<p>I see there are only 19 more days for the exhibition, so that I must look sharp if I mean to see it again, which I do.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I have just finished Orley Farm, and send it back and am very sorry it is over, though it hardly could have gone on any longer. I think Felix far too lucky<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

<p>I have just made an object of a bit of Zostera pulled apart to shew the threads, and put under glass slip with Canada Balsam.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

Some men of science had tried to debunk the story (‘The frog in the block of coal’, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 16 September 1862, p. 7), but others maintained the veracity of the account (see, for example, ‘The battle of the frogs’, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 24 September 1862, p. 7).
