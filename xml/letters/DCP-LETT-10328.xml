<p>I venture to send you by to-days post a paper on our singular pitcher plant (Darlingtonia californica) which I read a few evenings since before our Academy of Sciences.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Accompanying it are some well dried specimens of the plant itself, both leaves &amp; flowers, &amp; an admirably colored photograph of a group of Darlingtonia, which I trust may prove of some interest to you. The latter will at any rate give you a good idea of the perfection to which Photography has been brought in San Francisco.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I must ask you to excuse the few typographical errors in the text, which I had no opportunity to correct until too late. In my entomological studies, I have long sought for the chance to observe the species captured by Darlingtonia, &amp; you will I am sure think that I have been tolerably successful. If you think you could cultivate the plant, I shall be very happy to forward living specimens to you in the spring, though I know that it has been in cultivation in England, &amp; probably D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hooker has it growing in abundance.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It would be interesting to know if in its new home, the habit of entrapping insects is continued, &amp; to the same extent as in its own habitat—</p>
<p>I take this opportunity of saying, that if you have no other &amp; better correspondent on this coast, I shall always be happy to place myself at your disposal, &amp; to aid as far as my ability will allow me, any investigations you may wish to make—</p>
<p>Believe me, Dear Sir, | Your faithful Servant | Hy. Edwards— <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
