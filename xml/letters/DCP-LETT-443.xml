<p>I have been very long in answering your kind letter: but now I have some news to tell you, which, I am sure will please you, as holding out to me, the best chance of happiness, mortal man can boast of in this world.—</p>
<p>It can be nothing else, but that I am going to be <hi rend="underline">married.</hi> The lady is my cousin Miss Emma Wedgwood.— <hi rend="underline">you</hi> will approve of marrying a cousin:<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; if you knew what a good dear little wife, the lady will surely make, you would approve still more, &amp; congratulate me, heartily, on my good fortune.—</p>
<p>We are to be married in the end of January, &amp; intend living in London, at least for some years, until I have wearied the geological public with my newly acquired cacoethes scribendi.— I have a busy, &amp; therefore a happy life before me, with a comfortable, though rather humble, fireside to spend my evenings, &amp; the evening of my life by the side of, that is, if I have the luck to live so long.— My future wife is a very good musician, so that I m〈ea〉n to acquire first rate taste in music, &amp; nothing less than symphonies of Beethoven shall go down.—</p>
<p>I am glad to find from your letter that science is not so much at a discount with you as formerly: although I believe it was always rather more theoretically so, than practically.— I am glad to find, you wondered properly at Glen Roy.— I cannot get people to be half enough astonished at it.— I saw nothing in my perigrinations to the Antipodes, nearly so curious in physical geography.— I do not doubt they are old sea-beaches: &amp; many most curious inferences may be, I believe, deduced from the fact.— This is a marvellous world we live in, &amp; I never cease marvelling at it. But just at this present time I marvel more at the prospect of having a real, live, goodly wife to myself than at all the hundred wonders of the world.</p>
<p>I am very much obliged for your kind invitation northward.— I fear it will be long before I shall be able to bend my steps that way: I often regret, how little I see of my good old friends: but the recollection of them &amp; of Cambridge days &amp; of our long walks often gives me real happiness. Heaviside flourishes at Heyleibury:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I was astonished the other day by being hailed by a Revd. Prof. of that College, as <hi rend="underline">President</hi>: which was explained to me by being informed that Heaviside had stated over what a noble club—I had once Presided.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Good bye, my dear Whitley, | Most truly yrs, C. Darwin</p>
