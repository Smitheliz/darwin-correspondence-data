<p>I think I mentioned that I had a few stuffed birds, &amp; as they would be of much more use to you than to me, I have taken the liberty of sending them to the “<hi rend="underline">Osmaston Museum</hi>” &amp; hope they will arrive safe.— I have also sent a few insects, a Carabus with 6 punctures—taken at Maer, &amp; another Leistus of a light brown colour.— Tell me what you think of these insects, also of a common black (but new to me) carabus.— N.B. The Terne was shot on Maer pool last September.—</p>
<p>So much for Natu History, &amp; excepting that I have been doing little else, &amp; therefore my letter must be as stupid as I myself am. I staid two days at Maer, where I left orders about your birds, &amp; on Monday returned to sweet home. Home is doubtless very sweet, but like all good things one is apt to cloy on it; accordingly I have resolved to go to Woodhouse for a week. This is to me a paradise, about which, like any good Mussulman I am always thinking; the black-eyed Houris however, do not merely exist in Mahomets noddle, but are real substantial flesh &amp; blood. Formerly I used to have two places, Maer &amp; Woodhouse, about which, like a wheel on a pivot I used to revolve. Now I am luckier in having a third, &amp; I hope I need not say that third is Osmaston: I must say, although for the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> time, &amp; although you doubtless would elegantly term it humbug, I do not know when I have spent 3 pleas〈anter〉 weeks. Would you be so kind as to present to your sister Emma, a few franks, which I have rummaged out, &amp; I hope some few of them will be new. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Joseph splendid example was before me, he indeed gave original sonnets, I alas must be contented with my minor contribution</p>
<p>I hope, when you write, you will give me a most minute account of every thing alive &amp; dead about Osmaston Remember me to your sister Julia &amp; tell her how much amusement I received from her permission of peeping, &amp; far from being able to forestall her in the article of news her letter afforded me as much pleasure as it did Catherine</p>
<p>Remember me most kindly to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Fox &amp; most tenderly (it is your own term) to the rest of your family &amp; believe me my dear old Fox | yours sincerely | Chas. Darwin</p>
<p>I want to know the name of a butterfly, which you have got, its wings are <hi rend="underline">most wonderfully jagged</hi>, &amp; of a reddish colour, after an immense chase with all the servants in the house I at last captured it—</p>
<p>Look over your butterflies &amp; you will soon perceive what I mean—</p>
