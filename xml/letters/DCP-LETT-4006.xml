<p>Many thanks for your note of Jan 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The enclosures were forwarded.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The maize seed has proved a treasure; for besides seeing the kinds, a young man at Edinburgh will experiment on the mutual fertility of some of the varieties.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Pray thank, when you see, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Scudder about pollinia (from whom I have since received a pamphlet):<ref target="#foot.f5"/> that was very good remark about attachment possible only to eye or proboscis; &amp; these are only two parts where I have seen attachment.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Thanks, also, about highness &amp; lowness of oak-tree:<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Hooker was pleased (to whom I mentioned your remark) about the “commonwealth” of Plants.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> When I send my Linum paper you will see about L. Lewisii.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>If you have time to read you will be interested by parts of Lyell’s Book on Man:<ref target="#foot.f10"/> but I fear that the best part, about Glacial period, may be too geological for anyone except a regular geologist.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> He quotes you at end with gusto.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> By the way he told me the other day how pleased some had been by hearing that they could purchase your pamphlet.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> The “Parthenon” also speaks of it as the ablest contribution to the literature of the subject.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> It delights me when I see your work appreciated. The Lyells come here this day week,<ref target="#foot.f15"/> &amp; I shall grumble at his excessive caution: I feel sure that he admits almost fully the modification of species by variation &amp; selection; &amp; yet, though writing at length on subject, is afraid to say so; &amp; he will not serve as guide to anyone.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> The public may well say, if such a man dare not or will not speak out his mind, how can we who are ignorant, form even a guess on subject.— Lyell was pleased, when I told him lately that you thought that language might be used as excellent illustration of derivation of species; you will see that he has <hi rend="underline">admirable</hi> chapter on this—<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>I received a little while ago the correspondence between Loring &amp; Field:<ref target="#foot.f18"/> I cannot tell you how it has interested us all: it is so real; &amp; it so curious to see two able &amp; honest men differing so enormously. of course I side chiefly with the Englishman; but I never so well understood your horror of Disunion. It is very natural that you sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. dread becoming split up like Germany; but to us it does not seem quite so horrible. I think both correspondents underrate the very general belief entertained for many years in England, that your Government delighted in making us eat dirt, &amp; that we had eat dirt about Boundary Line, Right of Search, Vancouver Is<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> I believe that this has greatly checked all sympathy with you; &amp; made the whole country fire up, when, as we thought, you had passed our swallowing powers in the Trent affair.—<ref target="#foot.f20"/> after finishing the above Correspondence; I read Cairns excellent Lecture, which shows so well how your quarrell arose from Slavery.<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>It made me for a time wish honestly for north; but I could never help, though I tried, all the time thinking how we sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be bullied &amp; forced into a war by you, when you were triumphant. But I do, most truly think it dreadful that the South, with its accursed Slavery, sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. triumph, &amp; spread the evil. I think if I had power, which thank God I have not, I would let you conquer the border states, &amp; all west of Mississippi &amp; then force you to acknowledge the Cotton States. For Do you not now begin to doubt whether you can conquer &amp; hold them? I have inflicted a long tirade on you.—</p>
<p>The Times is getting more detestable,—but that is too weak a word,—than ever.<ref target="#foot.f22"/> My good wife wishes to give it up; but I tell her that is a pitch of heroism, to which only a woman is equal to.. To give up the “Bloody Old Times” as Cobbett used to call it, would be to give up meat drink &amp; air.—<ref target="#foot.f23"/></p>

In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3897.xml" resp="#automat" cert="medium">letter to Gray of 2 January [1863]</ref>, CD expressed doubt about the view of the French botanist Jules Emile Planchon (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6320.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Planchon 1847–8</ref>, p. 175) that <hi rend="italic">Linum lewisii</hi> was only a variety of <hi rend="italic">L. perenne</hi>, and noted Planchon’s observation that <hi rend="italic">L. lewisii</hi> was trimorphic, bearing ‘on the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> plant flowers with long, &amp; short &amp; equal (to anthers) pistils’. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7887.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Two forms in species of <hi rend="italic">Linum</hi>’</ref>, pp. 82–3 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 104–5), CD argued: <quote type="quote"> now that we know the meaning of reciprocal dimorphism, [<hi rend="italic">L. lewisii</hi>] surely deserves specific honours.... According to Planchon, the same plant bears some flowers with anthers and stigmas of the same height, and others with styles either longer or shorter than the stamens; so that the same individual plant is trimorphic. This, as far as I know, is a unique case. From analogy we may pretty safely predict the function of the three kinds of flowers: those with stigmas and anthers of the same height will be self-fertile; those with these organs of unequal height will require reciprocal fertilization. </quote> CD sent Gray two copies of the paper, which was read before the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> on 5 February 1863, on 18 April 1863 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4110.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 20 April [1863]</ref>).</note>

Quoting from the pamphlet, Lyell enthusiastically embraced Gray’s argument that there was no inconsistency between natural selection and natural theology (C. Lyell 1863a, p. 506): <quote type="quote"> The whole course of nature may be the material embodiment of a preconcerted arrangement; and if the succession of events be explained by transmutation, the pereptual adaptation of the organic world to new conditions leaves the argument in favour of design, and therefore of a designer, as valid as ever; ‘for to do any work by an instrument must require, and therefore presuppose, the exertion rather of more than of less power, than to do it directly.’ </quote></note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f19">The United States and Britain had been involved in several border disputes, focusing particularly on Canada’s borders with the United States, and including a dispute over the position of the boundary in the San Juan de Fuca Strait between Vancouver Island and United States territory to the south, a dispute which was not settled until 1871 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_129.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">H. C. Allen 1954</ref>, pp. 391–415). The ‘Right of search’ was the granting of reciprocal rights between nations to search ships for slaves, following agreements to bring an end to the international slave trade. Although the United States government subscribed to the ban on the slave trade, it consistently maintained the full freedom of the seas and refused to concede the right of search, even in the face of British pressure. Following the outbreak of the Civil War, in an effort by the Union to influence British opinion in its favour, and because the representatives from the southern states no longer occupied positions in the legislature, a right of search was finally ratified in Washington in April 1862 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7342.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Soulsby 1933</ref>).</note>
