<p>You will be weary of notes from me about the little book of yours.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is lucky for me that I expressed, before reading no VI, my opinion of its absolute excellence, &amp; of its being well worth wide distribution &amp; worth correction (not that I see where you could improve), if you thought it worth your valuable time. Had I read no VI, even a rudiment of modesty would, or ought to, have stopped me saying so much.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Though I have been well abused, yet I have had so much praise, that I have become a gourmand, both as to capacity &amp; taste; &amp; I really did not think that mortal man could have tickled my palate in the exquisite manner with which you have done the job.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> So I am an old ass, &amp; nothing more need be said about this.— I agree entirely with all your reservations about accepting the doctrine,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; you might have gone further with further safety &amp; truth. Of course I do not <hi rend="doubleUnderline">wholly</hi> agree about sterility.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I hate beyong all things finding myself in disagreement with any capable judge, when the premises are the Same; &amp; yet this will occasionally happen.</p>
<p>Thinking over my former letter to you,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I fancied (but I now doubt) that I had partly found out cause of our disagreement, &amp; I attributed it to your naturally thinking most about animals, with which the sterility of the hybrids is much more conspicuous than the lessened fertility of the first cross.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Indeed this could hardly be ascertained with mammals, except by comparing the product of whole life; &amp; as far as I know this has only been ascertained in case of Horse &amp; ass, which do produce fewer offspring in lifetime than in pure breeding. In plants the test of first cross seems as fair, as test of sterility of hybrids. And this latter test applies, I will maintain to the death, to the crossing of vars. of Verbascum &amp; vars, selected vars, of Zea.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> You will say go to the Devil &amp; hold your tongue.— No I will not hold my tongue; for I must add that after going for my present book all through domestic animals;<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I have come to conclusion that there are almost certainly several cases of 2 or 3 or more species blended together &amp; now perfectly fertile together. Hence I conclude that there must be something in domestication,—perhaps the less stable conditions,—the very cause which induces so much variability,—, which eliminates the natural sterility of species, when crossed.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> If so, we can see how unlikely that sterility should arise between domestic races. Now I will hold my tongue.—</p>
<p>p 143. ought not “Sanscrit” to be “Aryan”?<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>What a capital number the last N.H. Review is.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> That is a grand paper by Falconer.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I cannot say how indignant Owen’s conduct about E. Columbi has made me.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I believe I hate him more than you do,<ref target="#foot.f16"/> even perhaps more than good old Falconer does. But I have bubbled over to one or two correspondents on this head, &amp; will say no more.—<ref target="#foot.f17"/> I have sent Lubbock a little Review of Bates’ paper in Linn. Transact. which L. seems to think will do for your Review.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/> Do inaugurate a great improvement, &amp; have pages cut, like the Yankees do;<ref target="#foot.f19"/> I will heap blessings on your head. Do not waste your time in answering this.—</p>
<p>Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is established by the reference to T. H. Huxley 1863a (see n. 2, below), and by the relationship between this letter and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3878.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to T. H. Huxley, 28 December [1862]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10; see nn. 3 and 7, below). CD wrote ‘Dec.’ in error.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Between 10 November and 15 December 1862, Huxley delivered six lectures at the Museum of Practical Geology in London. The lectures were transcribed by the shorthand writer J. Aldous Mays and published in six parts by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2113.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Robert Hardwicke</ref> in 1862; they were subsequently bound together and sold as a separate volume (T. H. Huxley 1863a). Huxley sent the first three parts with his letter to CD of 2 December 1862 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10); for CD’s comments, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, letters to T. H. Huxley, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3848.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">7 December [1862]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3866.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">18 December [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3878.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">28 December [1862]</ref>. CD’s annotated copies of the six parts of T. H. Huxley 1863a are in the Darwin Library–CUL (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi></ref> 1: 425).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3878.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to T. H. Huxley, 28 December [1862]</ref>. Huxley’s sixth lecture was entitled: ‘A critical examination of the position of Mr. Darwin’s work, “On the Origin of Species,” in relation to the complete theory of the causes of the phenomena of organic nature’ (T. H. Huxley 1863a, pp. 133–57).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">In the last lecture of the series (see n. 3, above), Huxley examined CD’s method of inquiry in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, and concluded (T. H. Huxley 1863a, pp. 156–7) by comparing CD’s work to that of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1170.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Georges Cuvier</ref> (Cuvier 1817) and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_225.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Karl Ernst von Baer</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_298.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Baer 1828–37</ref>): <quote type="quote"> Mr. Darwin’s work is the greatest contribution which has been made to biological science since the publication of the ‘Règne Animal’ of Cuvier, and since that of the ‘History of Development,’ of Von Baer. I believe that if you strip it of its theoretical part it still remains one of the greatest encyclopædias of biological doctrine that any one man ever brought forth; … it is destined to be the guide of biological and psychological speculation for the next three or four generations. </quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Huxley argued that CD had yet to demonstrate sterility between the offspring of hybrids to prove the role of natural selection in speciation (T. H. Huxley 1863a, pp. 146–9, and n. 6, below); Huxley added that he ‘provisionally’ accepted CD’s general hypothesis (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 151–2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">For Huxley, CD’s views would not be ‘beyond the reach of all possible assault’ (T. H. Huxley 1863a, p. 147), until CD could demonstrate: <quote type="quote"> the possibility of developing from a particular stock, by selective breeding, two forms, which should either be unable to cross one with another, or whose cross-bred offspring should be infertile with one another. </quote> Only then, Huxley argued, would artificial selection have proved the role of natural selection in the origin of new species (see T. H. Huxley 1863a, pp. 146–50, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, Appendix VI).</note>

CD and Huxley had been debating the significance to natural selection of hybrid sterility since January 1860 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, Appendix VI).

            <note xml:id="foot.f12">T. H. Huxley 1863a, pp. 142–3. Huxley contrasted the doctrines of special creation and descent by modification, illustrating his point by references to the fossil record, homologies in the parts of animals, and the derivation of languages from pre-existing languages. In the passage to which CD refers, Huxley had written that the English and Greek languages were derived from Sanskrit.
