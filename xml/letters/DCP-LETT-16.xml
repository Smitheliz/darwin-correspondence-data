<p>As I suppose Erasmus has given all the particulars of the journey I will say no more about it, except that alltogether it has cost me 7 pounds— We got into our lodgings yesterday evening, which are very comfortable &amp; near the College— Our Landlady, by name M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Mackay, is a nice clean old body, and exceedingly civil &amp; attentive— She lives in “11 Lothian Street Edinburg”<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; only four flights of steps from the ground floor which is very moderate to some other lodgings that we were nearly taking— The terms are 1£—6<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> . for two very nice &amp; <hi rend="underline">light</hi> bedrooms &amp; a nice sitting room; by the way, light bedrooms are very scarce articles in Edinburg, since most of them are little holes in which there is neither air or light. We called on D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hawley<ref target="#foot.f3"/> the first morning, whom I think we never should have found had it not been a good natured D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. of Divinity who took us into his Library &amp; showed us a map, &amp; gave us how find him: Indeed all the Scotchmen are so civil and attentive, that it is enough to make an Englishman ashamed of himself—</p>
<p>I should think D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Butler or any other fat English divine would take two utter strangers into his library and show them the way! When at last we found the Doctor &amp; having made all the proper speeches on both sides we all three set out and walked all about the town; which we admire excessively; indeed Bridge Street is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw, and when we first looked over the sides we could hardly believe our eyes, when, instead of a fine river we saw a stream of people—</p>
<p>We spend all our mornings in promenading about the town, which we know pretty well, and in the Evenings we go to the play to hear Miss Stephens,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> which is quite delightful. She is very popular here, being encored to such a degree that she can hardly get on with the play— On Monday we are going to Der F<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> (I do not know how to spell the rest of the word)— Before we got into our lodgings we were staying at the Star Hotel in Princes St. where to my surprise I met with an old school fellow whom I like very much; he is just come back from a walking tour in Switzerland, and is now going to study for [his degree?].</p>
<p>The introductory lectures begin next Wednesday, and we were matriculated for them on Saturday: we pay 10<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. &amp; write our names in a book, &amp; the ceremony is finished; but the Library is not free to us till we get a ticket from a Professor—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>We have just been to church and heard a sermon of only 20 minutes. I expected from Sir Walter Scott’s account, a soul-cutting discourse of 2 hours &amp; a half—</p>
<p>I remain Y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. affectionate son | C. Darwin.</p>

The <hi rend="italic">St. James’s Gazette</hi> passage on CD’s borrowing reads: ‘They included Good’s “Study” [<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2907.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Good 1822</ref>] (with which his list opened), Pemberton on Viscera [<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6230.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Pemberton 1806</ref>] (which Erasmus also took out), Young’s Philosophy [<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8563.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Young 1807</ref>], Fleming’s Zoology [<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2544.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Fleming 1822</ref>], Kerr [?<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4332.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Kerr 1792</ref>] and Foster [not identified], two volumes on entomology, Wood on Insects [<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8479.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wood 1821</ref>], Brook’s Conchology [<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_961.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Brookes 1815</ref>], and Newton’s Optics [<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5861.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Newton 1704</ref>]… What may be called the only lay work he took out was Boswell’s Johnson [<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_808.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Boswell 1791</ref>], which he seems to have read all through, carrying off a volume at a time.’ (16 February 1888, p. 5). In the following session (1826–7), however, CD did not pay the library deposit and borrowed no books at all (17 February 1888, p. 7) He paid his fees for two classes ‘Practice of Physic’ and ‘Midwifery’ and attended <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2536.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Robert Jameson’s</ref> lectures in Geology and Zoology, which he remembered as having been ‘incredibly dull’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_261.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi></ref>, p. 52).</note>
