<p>I waited till to day for the chance of a letter, but I will wait no longer: I must most sincerely &amp; cordially congratulate you on having finished all your labours. I think your place a <hi rend="underline">very good</hi> one,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> considering by how much you have beaten many men, who had the start of you in reading— I do so wish I were now in Cambridge (a very selfish wish however, as I was not with you in all your troubles &amp; misery) to join in all the glory &amp; happiness, which dangers gone by can give.— how we would talk walk &amp; entomologize— Sappho should be the best of bitches &amp; Dash of dogs: there should be “peace on earth—good will to men” (which by the way, I always think the most perfect description of happiness that words can give) I was very sorry to see Holdens name amongst what I suppose to be the plucked men,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; amazed to see Pulleins name no where.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>It would be superfluous to thank you for the Newspaper, as I am sure you must know how very anxious I was hear the issue. I believe (?) we have some bets pending about M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Philpot<ref target="#foot.f4"/> (who it seems has astonished the knowing ones) &amp; about yourself, which must remain in doubt till I go to Cambridge &amp; look at my betting book.— I received the swan about a week ago, &amp; should have written to acknowledge &amp; thank for it before; only that I thought it better to wait till the examination was over. We have not yet eat it &amp; it is probable it will keep sometime longer.—</p>
<p>My Father has had a bad fit of the gout together with a good deal of fever. he has been confined to his bed for a week.— he was very much pleased with the Hooper &amp; as he said himself, if we had thought for a month we could not have made two more acceptable presents than the Deaths head &amp; swan.—</p>
<p>I think it is probable we shall get for you both the common &amp; Pine Marten, the latter alive, which I should think you would like, as th〈ey〉 are very interesting animals to keep tame, so an Irish gentleman tells me.—</p>
<p>Now for Entomology.— a beautiful Agonum with dark blood red elytra.— a small Elaphrus; an insect like the Pederus ripalis,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> only with a white mark on each elytron.—cum paucis aliis.— in your next letter tell me how you get on in the science.— My life is very quiet &amp; uniform, &amp; what makes it more so, my lips have lately taken to be bad,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> which will prevent my going to Edinburgh.— my Studies consist of Adam Smith &amp; Locke, in the latter of which I suppose you are an adept, &amp; I hope you properly admire it— About the little Go<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am in doubt &amp; tribulation. I have had very little shooting. I went to Woodhouse for a week, &amp; on the first day &amp; first shot one of the young Owens<ref target="#foot.f8"/> cut his eye so badly with a Copper Cap; that he has been in bed for a week.— I think I never in my life time was half so much frightened: I am sure I have written enough about myself &amp; my own concerns: make a handsome return tell me every thing about yourself. I am exceedingly anxious to know what steps you have taken about the Curacy? where you are going? how long you intend staying at Osmaston &amp; the Larches?<ref target="#foot.f9"/> in short do give me an outline for the 2 or 3 next months. I hope you will write to me directly Erasmus is in Rome &amp; likes it very much. he wants me to join him in Geneva. he intends wintering next year in Paris</p>
<p>Remember me kindly to Whitley if you see him, Pullein &amp; Hore, &amp; believe me | My dear Fox | Yours most sin | C. Darwin.</p>
<p>if you do not get the Curacy I do not know when we shall meet again Qære. How much of this is legible?</p>
