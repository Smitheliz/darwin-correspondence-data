<p>I remember hearing the late professor Dicks of Edinburgh<ref target="#foot.f2"/> say in a lecture at the Veternary college there that he once knew an instance of a fully developed tooth being found in the testicul of a horse that I thought a very singular place for a tooth to grow in perhaps the very last member of the body where one would have expected it.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I have often remarked the great fleetness of hares in countries where greyhound coursing is much followed. I have lived in places where few or no greyhounds were kept and the hares though not more numerous were so slow that they were not unfrequently caught by the sheep dogs in a <hi rend="italic">[fore]</hi> course while when tried with greyhounds they made no sport   but in countries where many greyhounds are kept where the landlord of each village public house has his coursing dog &amp; where dogs are constantly being excercised and tried they do not catch one hare out of three they are sliped at so fleet do they get by being bred by natural selection from the strongest &amp; fleetest sires &amp; dams.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have now Sir jotted down the few things that come into my mind while I read your book   if they are of the least use to you as confirmatory evidence I shall be glad to think it a little return for the pleasure received by me from your writings</p>
