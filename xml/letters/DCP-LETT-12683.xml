        <abstract>
            <p>Appreciates what CD says about his writing on two diverse subjects. Argues for value of "interdisciplinary approach". Has CD seen the pamphlet, "Physics and ethics" which he co-authored with an anonymous friend?</p>

                    <p>I thank you for your frank and open expression of views in your last letter.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I can appreciate that there may be an appearance to justify a prejudice as to writing on several subjects in my case. But I think it will be—so far—admitted that as science progresses, it becomes all the more difficult to separate into distinct branches— that Ethics (for instance) cannot in the present day be treated apart from Physics: and minds are so differently constituted that each must (I think) try to do his <hi rend="underline">best</hi> &amp; hope to be judged by results, irrespective of connecting circumstances. But I venture to think (if I may be allowed the opinion) that a spirit of exclusiveness may tend sometimes to be carried too far. Thus (as an example), the modern Vortex-Atom theory might be thought at first sight an exclusively mathematical subject. But it has its <hi rend="underline">physical</hi> side.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Mental capacities (as is known) tend to develop in grooves. A man therefore (possibly) might be competent to do something on the <hi rend="underline">physical</hi> side of this theory, <hi rend="underline">because</hi> his capacity did not run high in the mathematical direction. Yet I can well imagine that a non-mathematician who attempted to suggest anything in regard to this theory (however carefully he might have thought it out) would run the risk of being considered <hi rend="underline">à priori</hi> presumptuous. Yet I think he should not withold what he has to suggest on that ground. The essential fact of the borders of all subjects encroaching on each other, gives (as it seems to me) an occasional chance for an outsider to step in and say a word with advantage—and may it not be beneficial sometimes for minds of extremely diverse capacities all to be brought to bear on one and the same subject: their sum being then equivalent to (the rare instance of) one mind developed in a large number of directions at once.</p>
<p>As regards experimental work, I quite appreciate what you say as to the value of this, &amp; have already (under drawbacks) given some time to it. From the exceptional nature of my career and the great disadvantages I have been under through the effects of religious dogma (which I can well imagine it may be difficult to realize), I do not expect to achieve much; but what satisfaction I have will be that of doing original work to the best of my capacity. I hope you will excuse these particulars and not think that I wish to draw you into a correspondence on personal matters which can be of very little interest to you.</p>
<p>Your’s truly | S Tolver Preston</p>
                    <p>P.S. I do not know if you may have seen (through Prof Tyndall perhaps) the pamphlet <hi rend="underline">Physics &amp; Ethics</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If so, I should merely like to say that the strong <hi rend="underline">materialistic</hi> stand-point taken up there is more apparent than real. But, as a fact, I was not so much concerned in the preparation, excepting in the <hi rend="underline">Ethical</hi> portion of it. Those who are unaware of the time and thought expended by my friend<ref target="#foot.f4"/> on this pamphlet, might perhaps think the critical tone adopted in places somewhat bold.</p>
