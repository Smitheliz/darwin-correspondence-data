<p>The case of the bees not entering the bottles seems very curious, &amp; I will mention it to Lubbock, who is by far the best judge &amp; observer of the minds of insects now living in the world.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Wasps have been as extraordinarily rare here, as they appear to have been common with you.— The criticism about the hexagons made by queen wasps is a very good one:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I well remember thinking over this case, &amp; how I wriggled out of the difficulty, I cannot remember. I do not believe that I was so dishonest as not to notice it: at least if I did do so, it was momentary forgetfulness, as I collected wasps &amp; hornets’ nests &amp; studied the different kinds of nests in the B. Museum, &amp; knew well that the Queen commenced her comb, all by herself.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> There is really not a scrap of news to tell you. Poor M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Parslow is dead &amp; she is a great loss to the village, as she was wonderfully kind to any sick &amp; poor person.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I go on working in my usual manner &amp; do what I can. I have occasionally attended for many years to the habits of worms, &amp; next month a little book on them by me will be published, &amp; as some parts may possibly interest you (for you ought to have been a regular naturalist) I will send you a copy as soon as it is published.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>My brother, Erasmus, whom you may in old times have seen here, has lately died; &amp; I am glad to say that his last illness was very short &amp; without any severe suffering.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Farewell my dear Innes | yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>I see that I have forgotten to take black-edged paper.</p>
