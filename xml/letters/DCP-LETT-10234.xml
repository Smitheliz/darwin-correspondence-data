            <p>Encloses an invitation to give evidence to Vivisection Commission. Satisfied with way things were going, but E. E. Klein’s evidence that he is utterly indifferent to pain of animals has done great mischief.</p>

<p>The inclosed tells its own story— I have done my best to prevent your being bothered—but for various reasons which will occur to you I did not like to appear too obstructive and I was asked to write to you—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The strong feeling of my colleagues (and my own I must say also) is that we ought to have your opinions in our minutes— At the same time there is a no less strong desire to trouble you as little as possible—and under no circumstances to cause you any risk of injury to health</p>
<p>What with occupation of time worry &amp; vexation, this horrid Commission is playing the deuce with me— I have felt it my duty to act as Counsel for Science and was well satisfied with the way things were going</p>
<p>But on Thursday when I was absent at the Council of the Royal Society, Klein was examined and if what I hear is a correct account of the Evidence he gave—I may as well throw up my brief—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am told that he openly professed the most entire indifference to animal suffering—and said he only gave anaesthetics to keep animals quiet!</p>
<p>I declare to you I did not believe the man lived who was such an unmitigated cynical brute—as to profess &amp; act upon such principles—and I would willingly agree to any law, which should send him to the treadmill—</p>
<p>The impression his evidence made on Cardwell &amp; Forster<ref target="#foot.f3"/> is profound: and I am powerless (even if I had the desire which I have not) to combat it— He has done more mischief than all the fanatics put together—</p>
<p>I am utterly disgusted with the whole business</p>
<p>Ever | Yours | T H Huxley</p>
<p>Of course keep the little article on Species. It is in some American Encyclopedia published by Appleton<ref target="#foot.f4"/> And best thanks for your book.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I shall study it some day &amp; value it as I do every line you have ever written— Don’t mention what I have told you outside the circle of discreet Darwindom—</p>

<p>I have just come from a meeting of the Vivisection Commission at which your letter was read,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> and, by the desire of my colleagues I write to you to say, that considering the great weight which would be attached to your opinion by the Public they hardly feel justified in abstaining from asking you to state them in person, unless they are distinctly assured, that such an exertion on your part, would be injurious to your health</p>
<p>I understand that, should you be able to appear before us you will be troubled with as few questions and detained for as short a time as possible; and the Commission will be glad to consult your convenience with regard to the time of your coming<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
