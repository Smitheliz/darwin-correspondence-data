            <p>CD agrees entirely with EK’s proposal. Has collected a good deal of material. Useless to hunt for correspondence between Dr Darwin and Samuel Johnson. They met only once and hated one another. Dr Darwin is said to have taken Henry Brooke, who published a poem entitled "Universal beauty", as a model.</p>

                    <p>I entirely agree with all you propose.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I should not think of striking out anything that you might write, but would alter my own notice in accordance with what you may write. My materials are increasing a good deal, and I hope that I shall be able to give some sort of picture of what the man was. I am quite indifferent as to who publishes the German edition &amp; it is entirely your affair. Pray understand that you will have to decide whether my preface or preliminary notice is worth translating.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I am sure that you need not hunt for any correspondence between my grandfather &amp; D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johnson, for I have always heard that they met only once &amp; then hated each other.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> In the only catalogue of English books which I possess there is no entry of ‘Blackmore on Beauty’. Henry Brooke published in 1789 a poem entitled ‘Universal Beauty’ I could borrow this book (but could not send it to you) &amp; if you desire could search whether there is anything about D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eras Darwin in it. My son has just told me that he saw, (he thinks in the Biographie Universelle) that Eras Darwin was supposed by some to have taken Brooke for a model.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Krause had proposed finishing the revisions to his essay on Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802) (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10668.xml">Krause 1879a</ref>) before <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1179.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Sweetland Dallas</ref> started translating the work into English (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11961.xml">letter from Ernst Krause, 30 March 1879</ref>).

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Krause had assumed that CD would like the German edition of Krause’s work on Erasmus Darwin to be published by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2732.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Eduard Koch</ref>, who was publishing a German edition of CD’s works (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11961.xml">letter from Ernst Krause, 30 March 1879</ref>; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2661.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Freeman 1977</ref>).
