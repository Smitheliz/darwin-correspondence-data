<p>I now beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> which I would have done sooner; but I thought it better for me previously to to write Prof. Balfour &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Nab as to their giving me testimonials.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I accordingly took the liberty of enclosing your letter within my note to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Nab so that he might be better able to judge as to testimonial required: I enclose what I have received from him;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> it grieves me to do so; as I know well that it is very different from that which he would readily have drawn out for me, had I accepted the situation offered me at Darjeeling by Prof. Balfour last autumn;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> and certainly the few months which I was with him afterwards ought not to have occasioned such depreciatory implications. In common justice at least, if he really considered me less attentive to my duties in the Gardens in the later months of my service, he ought only to have inserted a clause to that effect: instead of tacitly implying a continued carelessness to the practical deportment of my duties while under him. Fortunately he can lay nothing to my charge as to want of probity or sobriety, and I sincerely trust that the odium which he would convey as to want of energy in practical duties will not lower me in your estimation.</p>
<p>In my own mind—and I cannot help saying it to you—I think he does me an injustice: indeed I would very fainly return his note to him. I thought it better, however, to send it first to you, that you might clearly know his opinion of me before proceeding further in the following out of the suggestion of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker’s.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I also enclose the testimonial which Prof. Balfour has favoured me with.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I will not trouble you with sending any others at present; but I may state that I have very satisfactory recomendations from clergymen &amp; gentlemen of my own neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I need scarcely say that I should like very much to be enabled to follow out the suggestion of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hookers, as I have no prospects whatever of anything turning up for me in this country. I must add however, that my relatives could do little in the way of assisting me with money; so that for the present I would have to rely on the kind and generous assistance you have proffered.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I have wrote to a friend who has had to do with sending out gardeners to India as to cost of outfit &amp; passage, &amp; I will let you know the sum which he thinks would be necessary.</p>
<p>I will be glad to hear from you again soon: I can only feebly express my sincere thankfulness for the great kindness you are doing me, and the continued interest you take in my welfare</p>
<p>I have the honour to remain | Sir | Your obed<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. servant | John Scott</p>

<p>Mr John Scott was connected with the Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh for some years, and I have much pleasure in certifying that he was zealously devoted to the prosecution of botany.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> He was diligent and sober, and enjoyed excellent opportunities of becoming practically acquainted with plants, both as regards their structure and physiology and their cultivation. He made some valuable observations and experiments, the results of which were published in the “Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal” and in the Transactions of the Botanical Society.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
