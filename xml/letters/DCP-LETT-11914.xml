                    <p>We received your circular yesterday morning &amp; were surprized at its contents. You are wonderfully good to all of us—and that is more than the money.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> As to myself I don’t know that I shall want to do anything with it except invest it. At any rate the loss of my fellowship will make <hi rend="underline">no</hi> difference to me now, tho’ I hardly think it would in any case.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>We came here this morning in a most tedious train which took 2<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> hours for 30 miles. We went along a fertile plain all the way, which is however I think very malarious— Here we are close under the mountains which have still got snow on them from the late bad weather.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Yesterday was the most lovely day I ever saw &amp; tho’ the Sun was very hot the air was cool. Today it has been overcast &amp; dead calm, with a sweltering heat like the inside of a hot house. About 5 o’clk this evening it turned quite cold &amp; we are now sitting before as good a fire as can be made out of wood. Tomorrow we are going to drive to a gorge in the mountains about 10 miles away, which is said to be beautiful, and where also are wild monkeys in the woods.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>This town looks commonplace &amp; dirty, with straight streets because it is continually being destroyed by earth-quakes &amp; has been so restored by the French. The hillside is channelled by extraordinarily deep ravines &amp; geology seems to go on so fast that the grass has’nt time to grow much on the sides of them. This &amp; the half-snowed covered hills makes it look rather dismal. The most interesting part of the place is the fact that it is almost entirely Arabic. A good many of the women are dressed from head to foot in scarlet with only one eye visible, which is different from the Algerians who show both eyes.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> From here we are going to Hammom Rira about 30 miles further on thro’ the mountains. It is a hot mineral baths &amp; said to be a pretty place.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> We, or at least Frank, will return to Algiers on Friday (7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.) to sail on Saturday.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I am much too unwell to feel at all in humour for touring but I was sure that if I did’nt go now I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>’nt go at all</p>
                    <p>I return to the M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>L’s to stay 2 or 3 weeks more<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
