                    <p>I ought to have seen the place about Akebia &amp; Stauntonia, also I should think your explanation is quite as good as Sachs, or rather better as it explains the appearance without assuming any new cause.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I had so few Helvingia to work with I couldn’t try whether anything comes out of them.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Sachs gave me all the berries on the bush but it was too late. The difference in rate of drying is very well marked. Also 3 of the cleaned ones which I have wetted by squirting water over them have mould growing on them. Sachs said they tried some experiments about the growth of mould on fruit, by sowing mould spores on fruit &amp; they found that the mould grow far better on the fruit grapes &amp; apples which has been wiped. He seems to think it very important to make out whether water dissolves anything out of leaves, but he thinks the way of weighing would be no good, as not being delicate enough— He says that if you water a plant with lithium solution &amp; then put the leaves in water the lithium comes out. I have tried here with a tobacco plant &amp; it is quite easy to do &amp; lots of lithium came out.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He thinks it would be a good way of trying cleaned &amp; bloom leaves, though not absolutely convincing as you don’t know whether the lithium is in a natural state in the cell sap.</p>
                    <p>He says he has found dew alkaline which he supposes is from the potash coming out, &amp; thinks that also worth trying. I had thought of the lithium way with bloom &amp; cleaned, but thought it too imaginary a way. He suggests a a way of testing whether nitrogenous stuff comes out, to infect the water in which cleaned &amp; bloom leaves have soaked with a drop or two of bacterial fluid.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I wish I had thought of this before, as I have had very little to do for the last 10 days &amp; I might have tried it. There is a wild Lactuca here that has leaves which slew so that the edges are up &amp; down a vertical as they grow up, I find it has nearly as many stomata on the upper as on the lower side like an Australian tree.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It has bloom on both sides. I will bring some seed as it might do for comparison somehow with sleepers as its leaves are vertical. I think one might test the nitrogen in water from cleaned leaves with Drosera<ref target="#foot.f7"/>   I have given your message to Sachs &amp; he seemed much pleased &amp; said that he was much obliged, &amp; that Down was the first place he would wish to go to, if he manages to come through London<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date range is established by the relationship between this letter and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11639.xml">letter to Francis Darwin, 3 August [1878]</ref>, and by the reference to Francis’s planned arrival at Leith Hill Place (see n. 9, below). In 1878, the Thursday following 3 August was 8 August.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><hi rend="italic">Akebia</hi> (the genus of chocolate vine) and <hi rend="italic">Stauntonia</hi> are in the family Lardizabalaceae, formerly a division of the Menispermaceae. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4143.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Julius Sachs</ref>, having observed corkscrew-like contraction of shoots of <hi rend="italic">Menispermum</hi> (the genus of moonseed), had suggested that it would be easy to show the similarity of twining and tendril-bearing climbers (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-11638.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Francis Darwin, [before 3 August 1878]</ref>). CD suggested that the contraction was more likely to be connected to slow growth or ill health (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11639.xml">letter to Francis Darwin, 3 August [1878]</ref> and n. 2). </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Francis was conducting experiments on <hi rend="italic">Helvingia rusciflora</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Helwingia japonica</hi>); he was evidently attempting to determine whether any substance might be exuded from the petals (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11623.xml">letter from Francis Darwin,  [21 July 1878]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Francis was trying to work out the function of bloom, the waxy or pruinose coating on some leaves and fruit, and was experimenting with the berry-like drupes of <hi rend="italic">Helwingia</hi>. Sachs had developed the lithium method for determining rates of transpiration in plants (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10625.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sachs 1878</ref>, pp. 163–6).</note>            
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In 1872, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_999.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ferdinand Julius Cohn</ref> had described the role of bacteria in putrefaction; he had determined that bacteria split up albuminous compounds into ammonia or nitric acid and other products, and assimilated the ammonia. Water with a nitrogeneous solute to which a few drops of bacterial fluid had been added would become cloudy and later form a bacterial precipitate (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10684.xml">Cohn 1872</ref>, pp. 45–6). Sachs evidently assumed that bacteria would multiply in the presence of nitrogenous compounds in the water in which the leaves had been soaked. </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6"><hi rend="italic">Lactuca</hi> is the genus of lettuces. Francis evidently refers to <hi rend="italic">Lactuca serriola</hi> (prickly lettuce or compass plant); the upper leaves twist round to hold their edges upright in sun. Australian tree genera such as <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi> and  <hi rend="italic">Acacia</hi> typically have stomata on both upper and lower leaf surfaces.</note>          
            <note xml:id="foot.f7"><hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> is the genus of sundews.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">CD had extended an invitation to Sachs to visit him at Down (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11631.xml">letter to Francis Darwin, 25 July [1878]</ref>). </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">The letter has not been found. Leith Hill Place was the home of CD’s sister, Caroline Sarah Wedgwood, and her family; the Darwins visited there from 7 to 12 August 1878. Francis planned to join them on Thursday 8 August; he returned to Down on 12 August (<ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242)).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1739.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Frankland</ref> often assisted CD with chemical aspects of his research; he had perfomed several experiments on CD’s behalf when CD was working on <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4097.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Insectivorous plants</hi></ref> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vols. 21 and 22).</note>
