                    <p>I have a favour to ask you, which I hope you will not refuse. You have more than once kindly noticed my past anthropological work (Descent of Man. 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> ed. <hi rend="superscript">page</hi> 40) and though at one time I may have been opposed to the theory of Natural Selection, I have long since in my public lectures acknowledged the theory.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have given you my support, &amp; do not ask you to buy it.</p>
                    <p>During the last few years I have been very poor, and subject to a variety of troubles. Owing to the bankruptcy of my wife’s brother,<ref target="#foot.f2"/>  I lost some savings I had accumulated from newspaper work.But since in 1877 I had typhoid fever, I have become very weak, &amp; during the time of my illness I lost most of my press engagements. I have now sold off most of my books, and am in a great state of pecuniary distress &amp; privation, though in the cheapest lodgings, &amp; free from debt. I have made an effort lately to lecture at the British Museum, but in spite of the favourable notices of the press (there was one in the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> of Tuesday)<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I regret to say that no one paying has come to the lectures. I had relied on this course at least recouping the money I had advanced for advertisements. It is hard to lecture to no audience at all. Could you lend me five pounds till some brighter days come for me?<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am translating Fau’s <hi rend="underline">Anatomie Artistique</hi>, which will be paid for some day, when finished.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> My lectures at Westminster Hospital, though always duly delivered, have never paid, as there are very few medical students who care to work up the subjects of Comparative Anatomy; and Zoology is entirely above their level. I give lessons in Latin, Spanish, &amp; French to pupils, and should be always glad to have more. You have been very successful as a literary man. Perhaps the influence of South America has been of some effect in this. For my part, I have never quite shaken off the <hi rend="underline">calentura</hi> which has left acute ague, which has now lasted ten years.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Try to help me if you can. If I should again win back my old position on the press, I shall repay you some day. But in any case, you will have the consciousness that you assist one who has always respected the greatest Biologist of this century.</p>
