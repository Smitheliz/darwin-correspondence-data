                    <p>I was sorry to hear on my return from Scotland that I had missed the pleasure of a call from you,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> and also to hear from Mr. Teesdale to-day that you had returned to Down, owing, he fears, to the alarming condition of Miss Wedgwood.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I trust, however, that her state of health may not be so serious as he apprehends.</p>
                    <p>On my way South I stayed for a couple of days at Newcastle, to give two lectures on Mental Evolution, and hence my absence when you called.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I stayed with Mr. Newall, who has the monster telescope, and ‘as good luck would have it, Providence was on my side,’ in the matter of giving us a clear sky for observing, rather a rare thing at Newcastle.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>You will be glad to hear that our season’s work at the ‘Zoological station’ has been very successful. A really interesting research has been conducted by Ewart and myself jointly on the locomotor system of Echinoderms, he taking the morphological and I the physiological part.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> When next I see you I shall tell you the principal points, but to do so in a letter would be tedious.</p>
                    <p>I think it is probable that Mivart and I shall have a magazine battle some day on Mental Evolution, as I think it is better to draw him in this way before finally discussing the whole subject in my book.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
