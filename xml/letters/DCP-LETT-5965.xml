                    <p>I watched today a child of about 5 very gradually change from cheerfulness up to the very verge of squalling, and then back again by up &amp; downs to cheerfulness, so that I saw the change come over its face at least 3 times. it was a plump face so that the contraction of the depressor quite wrinkled the skin on each side of the chin, &amp; the contraction of little Zygomatic cause quite a deep little groove on each side of the nose, so that it was an easy face to observe. I am perfectly certain that the depressor began acting first, and left off acting last; and after it had contracted a good deal so as to be in a good horse shoe the zygomatics began acting strongly, but I could not be certain that they pulled up the corners at all, I do not see that that is necessary to determine, because I saw that they both could act perfectly together, for directly the child felt it was in the order for crying there came another contraction simultaneously of the depressores &amp; of the Zygomatics   I do not think the child actually made a noise, and the mouth was of this shape<figure rend="inline width15">

roughly. The child seemed at first to be rather wishing to cry for pity, and afterwards when scolded to try to stop.</p>
<p>I could not watch the eyebrows but I saw tolerably another boy (of about 4) in same way beginning crying &amp; I am pretty sure the eyebrows became oblique, at all events the eyebrows were not lowering &amp; there was a contraction at inner corner of each, but I will look again<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
