<p>I have got safely through the work, I will not say to my own satisfaction—but after all it does not much matter.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The book wont live—I doubt whether a work of travels can be made to live—unless like your Journal it is also a work of science—or unless like Eothen it is a collection of witty essays.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I thought afterwards that what I said at lunch the other day<ref target="#foot.f3"/> <hi rend="underline">seemed</hi> to show an indifference to painstaking in style: but my opinion (such as it is) is really quite the other way. For my own part I find it so difficult to make a paragraph read well, that I have always had a pleasure in finding out that the great masters of style only did what they did by means of transposition—erasure &amp;c.— All such cases I have noted down &amp; can mention a few from memory— Pascal wrote one of his short Lettres Provinciales—seven times— Balzac had 16 proofs of the Peau de Chagrin—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He is considered the best modern French writer so far as style is concerned— Rousseau is another case— item Dickens &amp; Macaulay. In short it seems to be a rule to which there are few exceptions Thackeray seems to have been one—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am down here not for the cure, but merely for air &amp; water— I know a lady in this neighbourhood who told me that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Rayner took non-patients,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> and that there was always plenty of croquet going on—so here I have come in preference to making visits, and going through heavy late dinners &amp;c.—</p>
<p>I hope that you were none the worse for your trip to London which certainly gave pleasure (to my knowledge) to a great number of your friends &amp; disciples—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I met an American young lady in London the other day—an old friend of mine—&amp; we spoke of Chauncey Wright— Oh, she said, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wright thinks that there is no country like England; &amp; I believe he thinks that there is no man like M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin. Here she made une petite moue<ref target="#foot.f8"/>—probably not liking your theory— One young lady with whom I correspond was shocked to hear I was a Darwinian— <hi rend="underline">Me</hi> a monkey indeed! she said— However in her last letter she said she was pretty nearly converted for she sat next at dinner to a naval man who described the Fuegians to her—their habit of eating missionaries raw &amp;c.—&amp; her opinion seems to be now precisely what you express in your Conclusion—that if we must own them for our ancestors, we can go a little lower down without feeling the drop.</p>
<p>I dont write this to inveigle you into a correspondence— I know how much you have to do in that way, and beg you wont trouble to answer this letter. But if you can spare me a few lines, after you have read my book I shall be very glad to have them   You will receive a copy in a fortnight or less—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Yours very truly | Winwood Reade</p>
