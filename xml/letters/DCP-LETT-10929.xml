<p>I can assure you that I was astonished when I read the list &amp; read it over again as I could not believe my eyes that you were omitted.— I was truly grieved.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Long before you were proposed I have had many talks with the President<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; others on their principles of selection, &amp; I could clearly see that age &amp; general position in scientific society (such as being a Professor &amp;c) had great weight.; also, (&amp; this perhaps is quite fair) having been proposed during several years; youth in itself appears to be a disqualification however much &amp; good work may have been done.— I am thoroughily convinced that the Council endeavour to the utmost to act honestly without any personal feeling, according to such principles as they think ought to guide them.— I can solemnly declare that though I have spoken about your Medusa work to many persons, no one has ever doubted about its <hi rend="underline">high</hi> value.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I wish that I had cut the list of the 15 names out of the Times, for I cannot remember them. I saw that age, &amp; patronage of Science &amp; position had done much.—</p>
<p>Finally let me most earnestly beg you not to withdraw your name, whether or not you care about being elected; for all would say that you had withdrawn through ill-temper &amp; would otherwise sneer at you.— According to my judgment the Council has made a gigantic mistake.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | If you agree (&amp; for Heaven sake do so) to have your name resuspended, I believe that as your proposer I must write to the Assistant Secretary.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I wish that you could sometime find out whether this is the case.</p>
