<p>I do hope you will excuse my not writing before I took my degree.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I felt a quite inexplicable aversion to write to any body.— But now I do most heartily congratulate you upon passing your examination; &amp; hope you find your curacey<ref target="#foot.f2"/> comfortable; if it is my last shilling (I have not many) I will come &amp; pay you a visit.—</p>
<p>I do not know why the degree should make one so miserable, both before &amp; afterwards; I recollect you were sufficiently wretched before, &amp; I can assure I am now; &amp; what makes it the more ridiculous, is I know not what about.— I believe it is a beautiful provision of nature to make one regret the less leaving so pleasant a place as Cambridge.—&amp; amongst all its pleasures, I say it for once &amp; for all, none so great as my friendship with you.—</p>
<p>I sent you a Newspaper yesterday, in which you will see what a good place I have got in the Polls.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> As for Christ did you ever see such a college for producing Captains &amp; Apostles.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> There are no men either at Emmanuel or Christ plucked.— Cameron<ref target="#foot.f5"/> is gulfed,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> together with other 3 Trinity scholars!— My plans are not at all settled, I think I shall keep this term, &amp; then go &amp; economize at Shrewsbury, return &amp; take my degree.— A man may be excused, for writing so much about himself, when he has just passed the examination. So you must excuse.— And on the same principle do you write a letter brim-full of yourself &amp; plans.— I want to know something about your examination: tell me about the state of your nerves.—: what books you got up, &amp; how perfect? I take an interest about that sort of thing as the time will come, when I must suffer.— Your tutor Thompson begged to be remembered to you, &amp; so does Whitley.— If you will answer this; I will send as many stupid answers as you can desire.—</p>
<p>Believe me dear Fox | Chas. Darwin.—</p>

He was always cheerful &amp; good tempered &amp; much beloved by his school-fellows. He was not a great proficient in the school studies, but was always busy collecting beetles, butterflies &amp;c. He spent some time, most evenings, with a blow-pipe at the gas-light in our bed-room At Cambridge I used to read Shakspere to him in his own rooms &amp; he took great pleasure in these readings. He was also very fond of music, though not a performer &amp; I generally got an order for him for Kings Coll. Chapel on Sunday evenings.’ (DAR 112: 14).</note>
