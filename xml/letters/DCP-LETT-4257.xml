            <p>Describes the similarity in plumage changes between Japanese and Chinese birds on the one hand and British and continental birds on the other. Suggests the changes are due to the warm gulf streams around both islands.</p>

<p>I have just received your’s of yesterday, and am very sorry to hear that you are again suffering, and that I cannot have the pleasure of meeting you again before I leave.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I trust however to see you at Newcastle.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I shall not neglect to send you copies of all the papers I have published in England in connection with Natural History &amp; Formosa,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> and if you are interested on Chinese topics, (which are normally distasteful to the British mind), I will present you with a copy of my work on the China war.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>You are doubtless aware of the cosimilarity of tendency to change of the Japanese as compared with the Chinese birds with the British birds as compared with those of the European continent. The causes are probably due to the influence on the respective atmospheres produced by the Gulf streams of the Pacific and the Atlantic. Whatever the causes the facts are pretty patent. The differences in plumage of several Japanese birds from allied forms on the main has been often noted, but the strongest in point is in the case of the Wagtails. You are acquainted with the instance of the Grey-backed Wagtail (<hi rend="underline">Motacilla alba</hi>, L) in England acquiring a black back—the <hi rend="underline">M. Yarellii</hi> Gould.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> In eastern Asia the same thing occurs in other forms of this group. The grey-backed wagtail of Eastern Siberia, Amoorland, and China, in Japan acquires a black back. The black-backed race was procured and noted by Pallas as a Kamtschatkan variety of <hi rend="underline">M. albeola</hi> (Zoograph. Ross. Asiat. Vol I. p. 507),<ref target="#foot.f6"/> and has been wrongly referred by modern authors to <hi rend="underline">M. lugubris</hi> of western Siberia. In Formosa however where the influence of the gulf stream is strongly felt in the prevalence of rainy weather, the grey-backed is the resident form; though in winter the black-back also occurs, as it does during that season on the China Coast. There is a marked distinction between the two birds, sufficient to distinguish them at first sight; but in my large series of specimens I have one undoubted grey-back with marks here &amp; there of black on its back.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="underline">Budytes</hi> group in the east are affected in a similar way to what prevails in Europe. In China, south of Shanghai, the Yellow Wagtail moults in summer into the plumage of typical <hi rend="underline">B. flavas</hi>, L. North of Shanghai it adopts the plumage of <hi rend="underline">B. cinereocapilla</hi>. In India &amp; Siam that of <hi rend="underline">B. melanocephala</hi>. In Japan that of <hi rend="underline">B. rayi</hi> of Great Britain. In Formosa similar to <hi rend="underline">B. rayi</hi> but with brown instead of yellow cheeks.— In Java &amp; the Archipelago with black cheeks—<hi rend="underline">B. melanotis</hi>. Thermally considered the lines of latitude coincide of the areas of the respective forms in the east &amp; west.— <hi rend="underline">Climate</hi> in these cases must therefore have something, if not all, to do with the cosimilarity of change. But there are many other like subjects, which will doubtless prove of interest to you have been considered at some length in the different papers I have written, &amp; the shortest way therefore to communicate them to you will be to send you the papers, which I will not fail to do, as soon as they come to hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I remain, with hopes for your speedy recovery to health &amp; strength. | Your’s ever truly, | Robert Swinhoe</p>
<p>P.S. I trust you will have no objection to send me a Photograph of yourself in return for mine which I now enclose.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I would esteem it as a great favour. Kindly sign your name at the foot of the <hi rend="underline">Carte</hi>. R S.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In 1863, the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was held in Newcastle-upon-Tyne from 26 August to 2 September (<hi rend="italic">Report of the 33d meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, held at Newcastle-upon-Tyne</hi>, p. l). Swinhoe gave a paper at the meeting entitled ‘Ethnology of the island of Formosa’ (see Swinhoe [1863b] and [1863c]).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Swinhoe was an amateur naturalist who had served with the British Foreign Office in the Far East since 1854, latterly as Vice-Consul of Formosa (now called Taiwan). He returned to London on leave in September 1862, bringing with him a large collection of specimens. During his leave, he lectured widely on his collections, publishing many articles before his return to Formosa late in 1863 or early in 1864 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3313.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">P. B. Hall 1987</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6763.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Royal Society catalogue of scientific papers</hi></ref>). Swinhoe issued reprints of many of his papers in 1863; these were apparently circulated in two bound collections, copies of which are in the Darwin Library and Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL, and in the British Library (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_706.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">BLC</hi></ref>). There are copies of Swinhoe [1863b–g], bound in a publisher’s case binding with the title on the spine ‘Formosa | R. Swinhoe’, in the Darwin Library–CUL; the volume is inscribed to CD, and is annotated (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi></ref> 1: 797). There are copies of Swinhoe [1863h–o], stitched into a single paper wrapper, in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL; the collection is inscribed to CD, and is annotated.</note>
