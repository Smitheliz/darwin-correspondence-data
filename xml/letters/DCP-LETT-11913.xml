                    <p>How you will laugh at the above, and think it a proof of my dotage— to send them.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> They however so exactly express my thoughts, when I enter my little study, and see your dear Fathers happy face, as Caroline coloured the lithograph for me— years, years ago, when she and dear Susan &amp; Catherine filled your old Shrewsbury home, and when you and I, were really in “lifes young day”—as happy as creatures could be.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> By your Fathers lithograph, (which is as <hi rend="underline">like</hi> as a daughters loving hand could make it)— I have your Sons Photograph of you, as you now are—no longer in lifes young day, but looking very grave and sedate—widely different from a fellow photo–of you which I always call you “in your rollicking days”—sitting on your chair, just beginning to feel your strength.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Well! Well! We are both old fellows now, but somehow I fancy that last Photo: must have made you older and graver than you really are. I shall try to get a half hour with you this Summer, if I can manage it and you will have me. I am just emerging from my Winter Chrysalis having kept the house all the winter, and feel rather like the Imago creeping out of it with my wings undried and rather shivery.</p>
                    <p>But as <hi rend="underline">my</hi> Narcissus obvallaris (our earliest daffodil) began to shew colour yesterday—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I quite hope for 8 months flutter (with other Butterflies this Summer. But, what a fool you will think me—and a nuisance to boot—if I go on in this way.</p>
                    <p>My reason for writing is to ask for a few lines from you telling me how you have past thro’ this trying winter, and how your excellent little wife is. I hope also your children are better than in the last account you gave me of some of them.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I hope we shall induce W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi> and his wife to come to us for a few days soon, when the spring opens a little. I like so much the little I have seen of him, that I should much like to see more. I fear they have no children, as I have never heard of any—but for all that, they may have some.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>What are you about now? for I feel sure that you are busy about something. I have all your Books within a yard of my Study Chair always, &amp; dip into them with much satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>We get smaller and smaller, in our numbers. I have only three daughters left now,—and one of those leaves us this Summer.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Our seven boys join us in the holiday Season—but they are only ephemerals.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I am just reminded (by a <hi rend="underline">scratch</hi>) that I have a most lively family that I am now watching—A lot of Harvest Mice (M: Messorius). They are <hi rend="underline">very</hi> pretty little creatures—quite distinct from any group of English Mice— Their tails prehensile and reminding one of a Monkey in a small way, they are always <hi rend="underline">feeling</hi> with the extremity &amp; catch hold of a wire or straw beautifully.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> These with a flock of Larus ridibundus black headed Gull—and a lot of Mole crickets—form my Menagerie at present. I wish I had a wall Garden for my Gulls, as I feel sure they would breed if they had space enough.</p>
                    <p>I am watching for the black heads to come on now.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
                    <p>I see a “Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Richard Lubbock” mentioned as observing their habits by Yarrell— I conclude he is some relation of your <hi rend="underline">wonderful</hi> neighbour—whom I should be delighted to know.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
                    <p>Well, It is time I set you at liberty—that is supposing you have not long since set yourself so by throwing my letter into the fire, as it deserves.— Commend my wife and self to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> we often talk of her—and wish we could see her sometimes and Believe me, old friend of some 56 years standing, | Yours always W D Fox.</p>
                    <p>If you were without a subject—you might write a Book upon the little German Badger hound.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>The way in which every part of the frame—is adapted from their underground life—is extraordinary— The skeleton must be very curious. One would imagine that these dogs must have been very much more used for subterraneous work than they now are—as it must have taken long to form their skeleton. I sometimes almost wish my Sons would die that I might examine the frame work. Of course you must have a well bred one to shew their peculiarities— Ours is from the Emperor of Germanys particular breed— The Princess Royal having given hers to my 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Son Gerard.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I wish we could have a ten minutes examination &amp; talk over him— | farewell.</p>
