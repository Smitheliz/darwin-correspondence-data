<p>We are a wretched family &amp; ought to be exterminated. We slept here to rest our poor Boy on his journey to Bournemouth, &amp; my poor dear wife sickened with Scarlet-fever &amp; has had it pretty sharply, but is recovering well.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Our Boy suffered sadly from the Journey, though we took it on the advice of two Doctors. I fear he will be an invalid for months, if not years.— There is no end of trouble in this weary world.— I shall not feel safe till we are all at home together, &amp; when that will be I know not. But it is foolish complaining.</p>
<p>I received a few days ago your letter of Aug. 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, with all the interesting details on Houstonia.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It seems a grand case. I hope that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rothwick will surely publish them.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The simple fact of two pollens in the same species, &amp; the reciprocal action of two hermaphrodites seems to me well worth establishing; &amp; till any first account is confirmed, nothing can be considered as established. I feel no sort of doubt after repeating my experiments on Primula; but I shall probably not publish till winter, (even if then) &amp; so M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. R. could first establish the case.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I must just recur to stamps; my little man has calculated that he will now have six stamps which no other Boy in the school has.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Here is a triumph. Your last letter was plaistered with many coloured stamps &amp; he long surveyed the envelope in bed with much quiet satisfaction.</p>
<p>I wrote you a mad letter the other day about Lythrum;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> but the case is worth some madness. Thanks for remarks about Rhexia; what you say about pollen flirting out agrees with what I have seen.— My Rhexia glandulosa seems very different, &amp; I believe offers nothing odd.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Heterocentron will, I suspect, turn out, as I prophecyed something marvellous like Lythrum.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I know <hi rend="underline">almost</hi> as well as you, that systematic work is the foundation of <hi rend="underline">everything</hi>; yet in your case &amp; Hooker’s case, I perpetually feel inclined to d——n systematic work.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I had a note from Hooker this morning giving a pretty fair account of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hooker; but it almost seems that her heart is slightly affected.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> He tells me that he has got two wonderfully different flowers on same spike of a Vanda.</p>
<p>Huxley is going to bring out a very curious Book on man &amp; monkey.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I can see no Honey in Melastoma;<ref target="#foot.f13"/> but secretion of Honey depends on most delicate combination of circumstances. The common Polygala will go on for many days &amp; secret none, &amp; then will suddenly all commence— I am scribbling away at a great rate.</p>
<p>Affairs seem to be getting with you more &amp; more terrible.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> What will the end be. It seems to us here far more fearful, than it apparently does to you.</p>
<p>Farewell my dear Friend | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. very much like, if time permits to hear what you think of my last chapter in Orchid-book.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>

According to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242), CD, Emma, and Leonard travelled to Southampton on 13 August 1862; on the same date, Emma recorded that she became ill with scarlet fever.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Rothrock had confirmed and expanded upon Gray’s observations of differences in the pollen from each of the two flower forms of <hi rend="italic">Houstonia caerulea</hi> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3679.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Asa Gray, 4 August 1862</ref> and n. 1). He had also demonstrated experimentally that each kind of pollen was more fertile when applied to the stigma of a flower of the other form than when applied to the stigma of a flower of the same form. This paralleled CD’s findings in <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi>, published in March 1862 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2048.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Dimorphic condition in <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi>’</ref>; see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2782.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">General index to the Journal of the Linnean Society</hi></ref>, p. vi). CD repeated his experiments on <hi rend="italic">P. sinensis</hi> in January and February 1862, with similar results (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3685.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 9 August [1862]</ref> and n. 13); however, he did not publish his findings until 1869 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4083.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Illegitimate offspring of dimorphic and trimorphic plants’</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Since June, Gray had sent North American postage stamps for <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1230.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Leonard Darwin</ref> (see letters to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3595.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">10–20 June [1862]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3662.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">23[–4] July [1862]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3667.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">28 July [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3685.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">9 August [1862]</ref>, and letters from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3637.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">2–3 July 1862</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3659.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">15 July [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3661.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">21 July 1862</ref>).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f8">CD suspected that plants of the melastomaceous genus <hi rend="italic">Rhexia</hi> might be dimorphic, and had asked Gray to make observations for him (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3679.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Asa Gray, 4 August 1862</ref> and nn. 3–6). Having obtained a specimen of <hi rend="italic">Rhexia glandulosa</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Monochaetum floribundum</hi>), CD carried out crossing experiments, the results of which he reported in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3595.xml" resp="#automat" cert="medium">letter to Gray of 10–20 June [1862]</ref>. Detailing his observations on <hi rend="italic">Rhexia Virginica</hi> in his letter to CD of 4 August 1862, Gray wrote: ‘I suppose you have examined no true <hi rend="italic">Rhexia</hi>.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">In October 1861, CD had begun to investigate the occurrence of two different sets of stamens in each flower of <hi rend="italic">Heterocentron roseum</hi>, those facing the petals differing in structure and colour from those facing the sepals (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3322.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 17 November [1861]</ref>). Suspecting that this might be a novel form of dimorphism (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3437.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to George Bentham, 3 February [1862]</ref>), he carried out pollination experiments between October 1861 and January 1862, in which the crosses made with pollen from the yellow anthers produced more seed than those made with pollen from the crimson anthers. In addition, the seedlings produced from the former crosses grew much larger than those resulting from the latter (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3548.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 15 [May 1862]</ref> and nn. 7–9). On 9 August, CD again compared the two sets of seedlings, noting: ‘the bigger ones were still twice as tall; the smaller being more compact habit &amp; more purplish leaves’ (DAR 205.8: 50). However, despite continuing to work on the family throughout 1862 and 1863, CD was not able to account for the two sets of stamens (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8595.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Cross and self fertilisation</hi></ref>, p. 298 n., and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5511.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">ML</hi></ref> 2: 292–302).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">In his letter to CD of 4 August 1862, Gray commented that, since he was preparing to do systematic work, he would be unable to carry out observations and experiments for CD. For CD’s concern at the amount of time <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref> spent preparing his <hi rend="italic">Genera plantarum</hi> (Bentham and Hooker 1862–83), see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3440.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 9 February [1862]</ref>, and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3513.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 21 April [1862]</ref>.</note>
