                    <p>Your letter and enclosure about the geese arrived the day after I left Dunskaith, but have been forwarded here, which accounts for my delay in answering, for I only arrived in Dublin a few days ago.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>I am sorry to hear about the onions, and can only quote the beatitude which is particularly applicable to a worker in science, Blessed is he that expecteth nothing, for he shall not be disappointed.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>But I am still more sorry to hear of your feeling knocked up. I meet your son here, who tells me about you.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Yesterday was the evening of my big lecture, and I send you a copy as well as a newspaper account.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> (The latter was in type before delivery, and so no ‘applauses,’ &amp;c. are put in.) The thing was a most enormous success, far surpassing my utmost expectations. I had a number of jokes which do not appear in the printed lecture, and I never saw an audience laugh so much. The applause also was really extraordinary, especially at some places, and most of all at the mention of your name at the grand <hi rend="underline">finale</hi>. In fact, it was here tremendous, and a most impressive sight to see such a multitude of people so enthusiastic. I expected an outburst, but the loud and long-continued cheering beat anything that ever I heard before. I do not know whether your son was there, but if so he will tell you.</p>
                    <p>Hooker, Huxley, Allen, and Sir W. Thomson, Flower, D. Galton, and a lot of other good men were present, and had nothing but praise to give, Captain Galton going so far as to say that it was the most successful lecture he had ever heard.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> So I am quite conceited.</p>

CD’s copy of the printed version of the lecture is in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL (G. J. Romanes 1878b). The newspaper account has not been found in the Darwin Archive, but Romanes may have sent an article, ‘Lecture in the Exhibition Palace’, from the <hi rend="italic">Irish Times</hi>, 17 August 1878, p. 10. The article quoted extensively from Romanes’s talk and described the favourable audience reaction, but did not include any specific interjected audience response.</note>
