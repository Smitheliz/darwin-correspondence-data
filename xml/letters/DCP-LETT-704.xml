<p>Why did you not tell me how your old self was: be sure tell me exactly next letter.— As for myself I am very brisk &amp; have just been paying a call on Nancy &amp; have been admiring her chateau, which really is very nice.— She showed two very old letters of my mother, such kind &amp; considerate ones they were &amp; the hand very like that of the Wedgwood family.— She also showed me a letter from Aunt Bessy which came with crockery &amp; M. de Sevigne could not, I should think, have written more prettily on such an occasion.—</p>
<p>My letter will consist of odds &amp; ends— I have not seen Baby,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> but Caroline looks to day death-like pale &amp; I do not like her looks— if the Baby cries, as she did last night, she stays up for hours.— I go out for a turn on the terrace several times a day &amp; mean after Luncheon to attempt Shelton Rough,—but the fine ash-trees there have all been cut down.— I weighed <hi rend="underline">yesterday </hi> before luncheon 11<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. 2 <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> lbs:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> please enter it in your book.— I had nice talk last night with the girls, as I briskened up after nine oclock, before which time I felt a good deal overwhelmed by the talking— I got into a transport over the thought of Doddy &amp; talked like an old fool for nearly an hour about nothing else &amp; I really believe the girls sympathised with it all.— I ended with protest, that although I had done Doddy justice, they were not suppose that Annie was not a good little soul—bless her little Botty— Absence makes me very much in love with my own dear three chickens.— I enclose the key (take care &amp; keep it locked up) of the drawer of keys, that you may get out key of Dining room of cupboard for the tulip-bulbs for <hi rend="underline">dziver.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f3"/> Ask her to take the trouble to send here a copy of Snow’s autobiographical sketch: they all here are very curious to see it.— I presume Fanny could have no objection.—</p>
<p>Looking over your letter again, I see I somehow overlooked that you say you have been pretty brisk— I am very glad of it— you seem to have had a nice evening at 16.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> You were quite right to send me sneers versus M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott— I have amused them here with Homœopathetic stories.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> My Father observes that as long as he can remember, there has always been something wonderful, more or less of the same kind, going on &amp; there has always been people weak enough to believe &amp; he says, slapping both knees, he supposes there always will be—so that he thinks M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Scott no greater a fool than the other past &amp; future fools; a more charitable belief, than I can indulge in—</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Owen called here on Monday in the most wretched spirits, crying violently &amp; looking very thin.— she has lost the use of one arm &amp; my Father is frightened at this, thinking it perhaps is forerunner of paralytic stroke.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> By the way I told him of my dreadful numbness in my finger ends, &amp; all the sympathy I could get, was “yes, yes exactly—tut-tut, neuralgic, exactly yes yes”— Nor will he sympathise about money “stuff &amp; nonsense” is all he says to my fears of ruin &amp; extravagance</p>
