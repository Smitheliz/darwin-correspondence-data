<p>Dear Innes</p>
<p>Many thanks for your kind &amp; pleasant letter. I cannot give a very good account of poor Etty, who had a relapse a week ago, which threw her a good deal back &amp; she has hardly yet got up to her standard a fortnight ago &amp; that was not high.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is enough to make one despair.—</p>
<p>I am very sorry that you have such poor success in building: I am sure you must miss a home of your own with your various animals &amp; pets. I had heard that Ainslie wants <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>4000, which it is impossible to believe he will ever get.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The rogue must be cleaned out some day &amp; have to sell at fair price.—</p>
<p>As for news we have none. I daresay you heard that Christopher Osborne is dead<ref target="#foot.f4"/>—the third death this year in the Friendly Club!<ref target="#foot.f5"/> You will have heard of the new Doctor, next door to where M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edwards is now staying.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have not seen him yet.—</p>
<p>What you say about my Book pleases me &amp; I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> look at it as high compliment. I never expected to convert people under 20 year, though firmly convinced <hi rend="underline">now</hi> that I am in the main right.— For a week hardly passes without my hearing of some good judge coming some little way with me. And those who go an inch will surely have to go a yard with me. By far the greater part of the opposition is just the same as that made when the sun was first said to stand still &amp; the world to go round. I am now passing through the press a new Edition.—   Did you see the Quarterly Review, the B. of Oxford<ref target="#foot.f7"/> made really splendid fun of me &amp; my grandfather.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>On account of Etty we lead a more retired life than ever, though this seems hardly possible. But to night Emma &amp; some relations in the House are going to a Ball at the Lubbocks. I see John<ref target="#foot.f9"/> occasionally but have not seen any other member of the Family for an age.—</p>
<p>I am heartily glad that you can give a pretty good account of your son &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Innes,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> to whom pray give our very kind remembrances &amp; Believe me Dear Innes | Yours very truly | C. Darwin</p>
