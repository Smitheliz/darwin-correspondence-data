<p>I have been reading Sir W. Thomson’s address, &amp; am most anxious to have your opinion of it— What a belly-full it is, &amp; how Scotchy— it seems to me to be very able indeed, &amp; what a good notion it gives of the gigantic achievement of Mathematicians &amp; Physicists.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> it really makes one giddy to read of them. I do not think Huxley will thank him for his reference to him as a ‘positive’ unbeliever in spontaneous generation—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> these Mathematicians do not seem to me to distinguish between un-belief &amp; a-belief.— I know no other name for the state of mind that is traduced under the term skepticism.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I had no idea before that pure mathematics had achieved such wonders in practical science, &amp; I wonder how far Thomson’s statements will be contested. The total absence of any allusion to Tyndall’s labors, even when comets are his theme, seems strange to me, &amp; the laudation of Tait, Tyndall’s veiled adversary both by name &amp; by implication so often, is not in good taste, considering that Tait has been the constant laudatory anonymous reviewer of Thomson himself in the Scotch reviews.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>The notion of introducing life by meteors is astounding &amp; very unphilosophical, as being dragged in head &amp; shoulders apropos of the speculations of the ‘<hi rend="underline">Origin</hi>’ of life from or amongst existing matter—seeing that Meteorites are after all composed of the same matter as the globe is—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Does he suppose that God’s breathing upon Meteors or their progenitors is more philosophical than breathing on the face of the earth?</p>
<p>I thought too that Meteors arrived on the earth in a state of incandescence,— the condition under which T. assumes that the world itself could not have sustained life.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> For my part I would as soon believe in the Phœnix as in the Meteoric import of life.— After all, the worst objections are to be found in the distribution of life, &amp; the total want of evidence of renewal by importations such as Meteoric visitations would suggest the constant recurrence of. The quotation of Herschels very early objection to Nat. Selection is surely not fair, if indeed correct, &amp; again highly unphilosophical,— what real objection is it to Nat. Selection that it should be too Laputan?<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Surely Columbus &amp; the Egg might have occurred to him<ref target="#foot.f8"/> &amp; to call this (Herschels objection) a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">most</hi> “valuable and <hi rend="underline">instructive</hi> criticism”! I wish he, or any one else would tell me the logical significance of the phrase “<hi rend="underline">the</hi> argument from design”.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I understand design well enough, but “<hi rend="underline">the</hi> argument from it” is just what the arguer pleases to argue— he means I suppose “a certain conclusion from design”, assuming always that his idea of design is God’s idea too. Again how the Deuce can “proofs of intelligent design” (in Nature) show us “through nature the influence of a free will”?</p>
<p>What will Huxley say to the phrase “Metaphysical <hi rend="underline">or</hi> Scientific” if Metaphysics are anything they are in his opinion good science as aught else scientific.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Are the Commentators on Paley, a bit worse than Paley himself?—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I am pleased with his praise of old Sabine, because I think there has been too much disposition to overlook his really great scientific merit, his indomitable perseverance,— just as I think Humboldt is underrated now a days— Well, these were our Gods my friend, &amp; I still worship at their shrines a little—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I am hammering away at a narrative of my Marocco trip,<ref target="#foot.f13"/> &amp; find it harder work than ever; I suspect that systematic &amp; descriptive writing hurts head &amp; hand for other writing— though you preserve freshness of style with any amount of purely scientific writing.</p>
<p>My wife takes Harriette to Berlin on Wednesday &amp; Willy escorts them.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> She (wife) has gout in the finger-joint I grieve to say; which interferes with her playing, &amp; what is worse with her writing, &amp; she likes writing as a manual exercise, as much as I hate it—</p>
<p>Do you see the Journal of Botany,?— there is a case mentioned on good authority of Viola canina (var <hi rend="underline">sylvatica</hi>) growing with the cristate form of Aspidium felix-mas &amp; bearing plaited &amp; crisped leaves after the fashion of the Fern!<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">William Thomson delivered the presidential address to the forty-first meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science on 2 August 1871; the meeting took place in Edinburgh, and Thomson devoted part of his address to the achievements of Scottish mathematicians and physicists (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7741.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomson 1871</ref>). The greater part of Thomson’s address had been published in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 4 August 1871.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Thomson concluded his address with a discussion of the origin of life on earth; he dismissed the theory of spontaneous generation of organic from inorganic life citing the authority of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2486.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Henry Huxley</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7741.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomson 1871</ref>, pp. ciii–cv). In his own presidential address to the British Association meeting the previous year, Huxley had concluded that there was no evidence for ‘abiogenesis’, or the creation of organic from inorganic matter (T. H. Huxley 1870b, pp. lxxii–lxxxiv). However, Huxley went on to state that an absence of evidence was not a basis for scientific belief, and gave, as a matter of ‘philosophical faith’, his own opinion that life had originated by the ‘evolution of living protoplasm from not living matter’ (T. H. Huxley 1870b, p. lxxxiv).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Huxley himself is credited with coining the term ‘agnostic’ in 1869 or 1870 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5936.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">OED</hi></ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The nature of comets, and in particular their ability to emit light, had been the subject of recent debate. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4839.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Tyndall</ref> proposed that comets were composed of vapour that partly condensed on exposure to sunlight, resulting in a highly reflective gaseous cloud (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7913.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Tyndall 1869</ref>). In his presidential address Thomson referred favourably to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4652.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Peter Guthrie Tait’s</ref> rival theory that light was emitted from the heads of comets as a result of collisions among the pieces of rock and metal of which he assumed them to be composed, with their tails only visible when illuminated by sunlight (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7741.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomson 1871</ref>, pp. ci and cii; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7616.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Tait 1869b</ref>). Thomson and Tait were both members of an informal ‘North British’ group of mathematicians and physicists particularly identified with support for established religion; Tyndall was part of an opposing group who promoted scientific freedom from organised religion (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5933.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).

Laputa is a fictional country in <hi rend="italic">Gulliver’s travels</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7572.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Swift] 1726</ref>), whose inhabitants invent absurd contraptions, including a machine that writes books by randomly rearranging words.

            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Hooker refers to an anecdote commonly used to illustrate the point that something which seems easy once one knows how to do it is not necessarily obvious at first sight. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5423.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Christopher Columbus</ref>, faced with critics who claimed that discovering America required little skill, was said to have challenged them to stand an egg on end; when they failed, he did so himself by gently denting the shell.

            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Thomson concluded his address by alluding to the argument for the existence of a divine creator put forward by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3647.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Paley</ref> in <hi rend="italic">Natural theology</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6152.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Paley 1802</ref>); the argument was based on the apparent evidence of design in nature.

            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Thomson claimed, ‘overpoweringly strong proofs of intelligent and benevolent design lie all round us; and if ever perplexities, whether metaphysical or scientific, turn us away from them for a time, they come back upon us with irresistible force’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7741.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomson 1871</ref>, p. cv).

The fern was referred to as <hi rend="italic">Lastrea filix-mas</hi> in the report.
