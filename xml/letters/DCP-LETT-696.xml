<p>I have nothing particular to tell you &amp; I do not know whether you are still at Kinnordy, but I must write a few lines, if it is only to tell you that we are alive. I have not been up to town for a long time, owing to our daily-expected confinement, which I heartily wish was over. Beseech M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>Lyell to write from your dictation some account of your doings, since leaving London.— The geolog. department of the Brit. Assoc struck me as rather poor; but the other sections very interesting: Zoology was better than it usually is.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Talking of zoology reminds me that I have had sanguine letters from Waterhouse, who speaks most gratefully (as he ought) of your exertions for him. He expresses a strong hope, that if he gets the place through you, that he may be thrown into your acquaintance &amp; he adds in that case he “shall enjoy his seven shillings a day from the British Museum, as much as most men would ten times the sum”.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I heard from Lonsdale yesterday; the end of his letter is written in a forlorn spirit He says he is working at a <hi rend="underline">very fine </hi> <hi rend="underline">series</hi> of Touraine corals (I suppose yours) &amp; that he thinks he is arriving at satisfactory conclusions. Forbes has lent him his recent Mediterranean species.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> As yet he has only made (if I understand rightly) one identification with recent species &amp; that with a curious, undescribed Escharina from Dartmouth harbour!—</p>
<p>An interesting fact, has lately, as it were, passed through my hands; a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Kemp (almost a working man) who has written on “parallel roads” &amp; has corresponded with me, sent me in the Spring some seeds,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> with an account of the spot, where they were found, namely <hi rend="underline">in a layer</hi> at the bottom of a deep sand pit, near Melrose, above the level of the river, &amp; which sand-pit he thinks must have been accu- mulated in a lake, when the whole features of the valleys were different— —ages ago, since which whole barriers of rock, it appears, must have been worn down— These seeds germinated freely; &amp; I sent some to Hort. Soc. &amp; Lindley writes to me, that they turn out to be a common Rumex &amp; a species of Atriplex, which neither he, or Henslow (As I have since heard) have ever seen, &amp; certainly not a British plant!!<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Does this not look like the revivification of a fossil seed? It is not surprising, I think, that seeds sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> last ten or twenty thousand, as they have lasted two or three in the Druidical mounds &amp; have germinated.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>When not building, I have been working at my volumecito on the volcanic islands, which we visited; it is almost ready for press; I began working at the M.S. last October, which M.S. I thought two years previously was fit for publication! I have cut away &amp; shortened at a good rate: Lonsdale is going describe a few corallines from a (mountain limestone?) series from Van Diemen’s Land:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I hope you will read my volume for if you don’t, I cannot think of anyone else who will!—</p>
<p>We have at last got our house &amp; place tolerably comfortable; &amp; I am well satisfied with our anchorage for life. What an autumn we have had; completely Chilian; here we have had not a drop of rain, or a cloudy day for a month— I am positively tired of the fine weather &amp; long for the sight of mud, almost as much as I did when in Peru.</p>
<p>With kind remembrances to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lyell | Ever yours C. Darwin</p>
<p>If still at Kinnordy pray give my respectful compliments to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lyell.</p>
