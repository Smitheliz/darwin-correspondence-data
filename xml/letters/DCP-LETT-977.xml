<p>I am truly pleased at your approval of my Book<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; it was very kind of you taking the trouble to tell me so.— I long hesitated whether I would publish it or not, &amp; now that I have done so at a good cost of trouble, it is indeed highly satisfactory to think that my labour has not been quite thrown away.</p>
<p>I entirely acquiesce in your criticism on my calling the Pampean form “recent”; pleistocene w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have been far better. I object however, altogether on principle (whether I have always followed my principle is another question) to designate any epoch after man. It breaks through all principles of classification to take one mammifer as an epoch. And this is presupposing we know something of the introduction of man: how few years ago all beds earlier than the pleistocene were characterized as being before the monkey epoch. It appears to me, that it may often be convenient to speak of an Historical or Human depoisit in the same way as we speak of an Elephant bed, but that to apply it to an Epoch is unsound.</p>
<p>I have expressed myself very ill, &amp; I am not very sure that my notions are very clear on this subject; except that I know that I have often been made wrath (even by Lyell) at the confidence with which people speak of the introduction of man, as if they had seen him walk on the stage, &amp; as if, in a geological chronological sense, it was more important than the entry of any other mammifer.—</p>
<p>You ask me to do a most puzzling thing to point out what is newest in my volume, &amp; I found myself incapable of doing almost the same for Lyell.— My mind goes from point to point without deciding: what has interested oneself or given most trouble is, perhaps quite falsely thought newest.— The elevation of the land is perhaps more carefully treated than any other subject; but it cannot of course be called new. I have made out a sort of index, which will not take you a couple of minutes to skim over, &amp; then you will perhaps judge, what seems newest.</p>
<p>The summary at end of book w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> also serve same purpose.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I do not not know where E. de B.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> has lately put forth on the recent elevation of the Cordillera, He “rapported” favourably on d’Orbigny, who in late times fires off a most Royal salute;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> every volcano bursting forth in the Andes at the same time with their elevation, the debacle thus caused depositing all the Pampean mud &amp; all the Patagonian shingle! is not this making Geology nice &amp; simple for beginners?</p>
<p>We have been very sorry to hear of Bunbury’s severe illness; I believe the measles are often dangerous to grown-up-people. I am very glad that your last account was so much better.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>With many thanks | Most truly yours | C. Darwin.</p>
<p>I am astonished that you should have had the courage to go right through my Book. It is quite obvious that most geologists find it far easier to write than to read a book.</p>

    <p>Ch.I &amp; II. | <hi rend="underline">Elevation of the land</hi>.— equability on E. coast as shown by terraces. p 19— length on W. coast p 53— Height at Valparaiso p 32— number of periods of rest at Coquimbo— p 49. elevation within Human period near Lima greater than elsewhere observed— The discussion p 41 on non horizontality of terraces perhaps one of newest features. on formation of terraces rather newish.—</p>
    <p>Ch III p 62. Argument of horizontal elevation of Cordillera I believe new.— I think the connection (p 54) between earthquake shocks &amp; insensible rising important.—</p>
    <p>Ch. IV The strangeness of the (as strange as Eocene) mammifers, coexisting with recent shells.—</p>

    <p>Ch. VI Perhaps some facts on metamorphism, but chiefly on the layers in mica-slate &amp;c being analagous to cleavage.</p>
    <p>Ch VII. The grand up &amp; down movements (&amp; vertical silicified trees) in the Cordillera. see summary p. 204 and p. 240 Origin of the Claystone porphyry formation p. 170</p>
    <p>Ch VIII p 224. Mixture of Cretaceous &amp; Oolitic forms— p 226 great subsidence— I think (p 232) there is some novelty in discussion on axes of eruption &amp; injection. p. 247 Continuous volcanic action in the Cordillera. I think the concluding Summary (p 237) w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> show what are the most salient features in the Book.</p>
