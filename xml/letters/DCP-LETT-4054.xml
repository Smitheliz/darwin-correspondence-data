<p>A few days ago I received from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Sclater a note written to him by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker mentioning your wish to obtain a tuber of the Wild Potato—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am very glad to say that it is in my power to supply you with two—the only two I have left— Had I known you were desirous of a specimen—I should certainly have placed the whole dozen that I brought home at your disposal. They were given to me by a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Colchester who is a merchant at Valparaiso, and was my fellow passenger from the West Indies a short time ago—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He told me he dug them up just before he came away—I suppose in November last—</p>
<p>He said they were growing on low hills near the sea, and on ground which had never been disturbed, for I asked him as to the possibility of their having been descended from cultivated ancestors— This gentleman though no naturalist, is very intelligent in matters of natural history—and if you wanted a correspondent in that part of the world might prove very useful. He assured me however that these wild potatoes are very bitter to the taste—which does not accord with your experience of the Chiloë ones, as given in your ‘Journal’—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I hope shortly to send you the foot of a Red-legged Partridge to which an enormous ball of clay is attached, in illustration of what you have said as to Birds transporting seeds<ref target="#foot.f4"/>—though in this case I am not sure that the bearer of the incumbrance could have ever flown with it.</p>
<p>I mean to show the specimen at a meeting of the Zoological Society—and will then, with the owner’s permission, hand it over to you—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> If this bird could have flown it could certainly have conveyed a very extensive Flora to a new island—the mass of clay being about 3 inches x 2<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> x 2.</p>
<p>I hope the potatoes will arrive safely, and I remain, Yours very truly | Alfred Newton <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

Hooker subsequently wrote to Sclater, asking him to pass on his request to Newton (see the letter from Hooker to Sclater, dated [15 March 1863], and the covering letter from Sclater to Newton, dated 16 March 1863, in <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_795.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Cambridge University</ref> Library, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3517.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Newton</ref> papers).</note>

Newton made a short visit to the West Indies in October and November 1862, returning to Britain in January 1863 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8450.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1921</ref>, p. 75, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4435.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Alfred Newton, 24 March [1863]</ref>, n. 2).</note>

CD stated that the tubers, when cooked, were ‘watery and insipid’, and he contrasted this with the bitter taste others had reported of the wild potatoes growing on the nearby island of Chiloé.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">In the 1850s CD had made an extensive study of the geographical dispersal of seeds (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vols. 5 and 6); the subject is discussed in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 356–65.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Newton exhibited the foot of the partridge <hi rend="italic">Caccabis rufa</hi> at a meeting of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5302.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Zoological Society of London</ref> on 21 April 1863; its owner was <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4558.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Henry Stevenson</ref>, secretary of the Norfolk and Norwich Museum (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5850.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Newton 1863</ref>). Newton made the specimen available to CD in October 1863 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4326.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Alfred Newton, 31 October 1863</ref>). In the fourth edition of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 432, CD reported that the earth adhering to the foot of the specimen weighed 6<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> oz, and that, despite having been kept for three years, it yielded eighty-two plants when broken, watered, and placed under a bell glass.</note>
