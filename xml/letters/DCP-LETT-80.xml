<p>I am very sorry to find that all our plans are likely to vanish into air.— It is most unfortunate your being obliged to go with your Father &amp; Mother to Cheltenham, for the weather is so fine, the beetles so numerous, our zeal so ardent that the Science would have received a benefit never to be forgotten.— But it is a shame to talk about would have taken place: let us think of the future.—</p>
<p>I am very much obliged for your invitation to Osmaston, but I do not see how it is possible for me to accept it My brother has returned from Shrewsbury to London, &amp; I have agreeed to pay him a visit, which if I do not do, I shall not see him again for a good while.— And after that I really must proceed to “ ‘sweet home’ ”.— for my unfortunate relations have been bereaved of my presence, for eight long Months.— But I have a plan which will remove a good many dif- ficulties.— Why, in the name of providence, not pay me a visit in Salop??? You know how glad we all shall be to see you.— You can start early from Derby, so through Lichfield to Birmingham, &amp; then per the Wonder<ref target="#foot.f1"/> to Shrews- bury, where at 11 oclock the same night you will arrive safe &amp; sound, &amp; make me glad by your sight.— What plan can be more easy or natural? It is too unreasonable even to Hope, that you will come to Cambridge for so short a time as four days, so that I shall not see till we meet at Shrewsbury. If you are half as eager as I am for that occurrence, you will not make any sort of excuse.— As soon as you return to Derby go to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hey,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; find the habitat Odontomyia &amp; Dromius &amp; promised specimens.—</p>
<p>My plans for the summer are totally undecided.— write soon be sure do not say no to Shrewsbury scheme else I will never forgive you.— till then, My dear old Fox | Yours very sincerely | C. D.</p>
<p>Wilmer has left Cambridge, &amp; begged to be most kindly remembered to you.— he has sent to Baker for you a Falcon out of Norfolk.— I have got your prints.— Chapman send Ditto.—he is going abroad.— I took the other day Elater sanguineus. What do think of that? I have 19 species in genus Amara.—</p>
<p>I have seen a good deal of Henslow lately &amp; the more I see of him the more I like him I have some thoughts of reading divinity with him the summer after next.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Adieu</p>
<p>As far as to the Bembididæ, this in toto 339 species,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> out of which I have 208 of them— What do you think of that?</p>

Earlier, at about the time of the reading tour at Barmouth (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-42.xml" resp="#automat">letter to W. D. Fox, 12 [June 1828]</ref>), according to Herbert, CD had serious doubts about this career. Herbert remembered ‘an earnest conversation’ he had with CD ‘about going into Holy Orders; &amp; I remember his asking me with reference to the question put by the Bishop in the Ordination service: “Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit &amp;c” whether I could answer in the affirmative; &amp; on my saying “I could not”, he said, “neither can I, &amp; therefore I can not take orders.” ’ (Letter of reminiscences to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1222.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Darwin</ref>, 2 June 1882, DAR 112 (ser. 2): 63–4).</note>
