<p>Asks CD for reference to the edition of <hi rend="italic">Kosmos</hi> that contains the original of Ernst Krause’s article on Dr Erasmus Darwin. There are serious differences between the translation by W. S. Dallas and the Feb [1879] article by Krause on which CD, in the preface to <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>, says it was based. SB notes in particular that the concluding sentence of the translation, which is clearly aimed at [SB’s] <hi rend="italic">Evolution, old and new</hi>, is not in the original. Since readers will assume the text of <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi> was written before his book appeared, SB asks for an explanation.</p>

                    <p>Will you kindly refer me to the edition of ‘Kosmos’ wh: contains the text of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krause’s article on D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erasmus Darwin, as translated by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W. S. Dallas?</p>
                    <p>I have before me the last February number of Kosmos, which appears by your preface to be the one from wh: M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas has translated; but his translation contains long and important passages which are not in the February number of Kosmos, while many passages in the original article are omitted in the translation.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>Among the passages introduced are the last six pages of the English article, which seem to condemn by anticipation the position I have taken as regards D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erasmus Darwin in my book Evolution old &amp; New, and which I believe I was the first to take.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The concluding and therefore, perhaps, most prominent sentence of the translation you have given to the public stands thus;—</p>
                    <p>“Erasmus Darwin’s system was in itself a most significant first step in the path of knowledge which his grandson has opened up for us, but the wish to revive it at the present day as has actually been seriously attempted shows a weakness of thought and a mental anachronism which no man can envy.”<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>The Kosmos which has been sent me from Germany contains no such passage—</p>
                    <p>As you have stated in your preface that my book Evolution old &amp; New appeared subsequently to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krause’s article, and as no intimation is given that the article has been altered and added to since its original appearance, while the accuracy of the translation as though from the February number of Kosmos, is as you expressly say guaranteed by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas’s “scientific reputation together with his knowledge of German”,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> your readers will naturally suppose that all they read in the translation appeared in February last, and therefore before Evolution old and New was written, and therefore independently of, and necessarily without reference to that book.</p>
<p>I do not doubt that this was actually the case, but have failed to obtain the edition which contains the passage above referred to, and several others which appear in the translation.</p>
<p>I have a personal interest in this matter and venture therefore to ask for the explanation which I do not doubt you will readily give me</p>
<p>I am | y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. faithfully | S. Butler—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2758.xml">Ernst Krause</ref> had published an article on <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1219.xml">Erasmus Darwin</ref> in <hi rend="italic">Kosmos</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10668.xml">Krause 1879a</ref>). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1179.xml">William Sweetland Dallas</ref> agreed to translate this article from the German for <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2365.xml"><hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi></ref> (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 27, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11935.xml">letter from W. S. Dallas, 14 March 1879</ref>). However, Krause sent a revised and much enlarged version of the article in manuscript, and it was this revised text, not the original <hi rend="italic">Kosmos</hi> article, that Dallas translated (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 27, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12032.xml">letter from Ernst Krause, 5 May 1879</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12037.xml">letter from W. S. Dallas, 7 May 1879</ref>). In the preface to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2365.xml"><hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi></ref>, p. iii, CD mentioned only Krause’s original article, having decided to omit much of the revised essay from the published English version. The additions were reinstated in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10752.xml">Krause 1880</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Butler’s <hi rend="italic">Evolution old and new</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10523.xml">Butler 1879</ref>) was published in May 1879 and contained lengthy discussions of Erasmus Darwin, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2786.xml">Jean Baptiste de Lamarck</ref>, and other descent theorists. CD sent Krause a copy of Butler’s book (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 27, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12051.xml">letter to Ernst Krause, 13 May 1879</ref>). Both CD and Krause were critical of Butler’s views (see <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12052.xml">letter to Ernst Krause, 14 May 1879</ref>, and letters <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12060.xml">from Ernst Krause, 23 May 1879</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12092.xml">7 June 1879</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12105.xml"> 13 June 1879</ref>); however, CD remarked: ‘I hope that you will not expend much powder &amp; shot on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Butler, for he really is not worthy of it’ (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-12096.xml">letter to Ernst Krause, 9 June [1879]</ref>).</note>
