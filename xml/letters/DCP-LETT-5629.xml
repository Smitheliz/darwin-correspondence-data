<p>AM discusses his new journal [<hi rend="italic">J. Travel &amp; Nat. Hist.</hi>] of which general opinion seems to be favourable. Has room for the occasional contributor, if CD knows of any.</p>

<p>Your letter has been forwarded to me here, where I am luxuriating in draughts of Native air.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I am truly obliged by your sending me the Italian Memoirs—the more that it is a token that you mean to take an interest in the New Journal.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I shall look at them when I return to town (next week)—and if they seem suitable will get them reviewed by a Competent Italian Scholar. My Italian goes very much upon Crutches.—</p>
<p>I launched the Journal at the Meeting of the British Association at Dundee—that is—made known the prospectus on the other side and I think the general opinion so far as it reached me was in favour of it.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Of course I am not a very good judge, as I would be the last to hear anything depreciatory.—</p>
<p>I have still room for one or two occasional contributors &amp; if you know any qualified persons who would be content with a remuneration of 8£ per sheet for original articles &amp; £5 for reviews send them to me.—</p>
<p>With many thanks I am | Yours very truly | And<hi rend="superscript">w</hi>. Murray</p>
