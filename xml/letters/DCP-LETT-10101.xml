<p>Just when leaving Trinity College, where I had enjoyed Mr. Balfour’s kind hospitality, he told me, that an invitation from you had arrived for me and Mrs. Dohrn, “if she were here.”<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I have to thank you very cordially for it, but unfortunately for me I am so much pressed with business, and that of such a restless character, that I find neither time nor, what is still more important, a fit disposition of mind to present me in society, and especially in a house like yours, where the “accessit”<ref target="#foot.f2"/> ought only be given to people, who are not likely to be a bother in any way. Experience has proved to me, that I belong to this class in general, and finding, that all I would have to say to you, would be to thank you once more very heartily and earnestly for having once rescued me from shipwrecking, I think I may do this as well in a letter, and defer a visit to such period, where the care for the Zoological Station will have let me free and the food-yolk of my embryonic scientific conceptions may have so far disappeared as to allow a fuller presentation of the Embryo to eyes like yours.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Mrs. Dohrn will be proud to hear, that she ought to have had the honour of seeing you and your family;— she carries with her the Volume you so kindly sent to me to Naples, when I already had left.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> It will be my reward for the present, not to pleasant railway-life, that at home on our country-house I shall be able to read “Insectivorus plants” with all possible ease and quietness, and vote repeated thanks to its Author and kind Donator.</p>
<p>Mr. Balfour will vivify this letter in telling you how disagreable a man I have become,— I can only express the hope, that future time may give me an occasion to present me in your house in a better condition of mind, than I am in at present.</p>
<p>With my kindest regards to Mrs. Darwin | your sons and yourself | Yours faithfully | Anton Dohrn</p>
