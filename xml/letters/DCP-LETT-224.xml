            <p>Finds CD’s journal very entertaining and interesting, but thinks his style in first part too much influenced by Humboldt.</p>
            <p>Sends some books by Harriet Martineau and Archbishop Whately.</p>
            <p>Rejoices that the more he sees of Negroes, the better he thinks of them.</p>

<p>I have been reading with the greatest interest your journal &amp; I found it <hi rend="doubleUnderline">very</hi> entertaining &amp; interesting, your writing at the time gives such reality to your descriptions &amp; brings every little incident before one with a force that no after account could do. I am very doubtful whether it is not <hi rend="underline">pert</hi> in me to criticize, using merely my own judgment, for no one else of the family have yet read this last part—but I <hi rend="underline">will</hi> say just what I think—I mean as to your style. I thought in the first part (of this last journal) that you had, probably from reading so much of Humboldt, got his phraseology &amp; occasionly made use of the kind of flowery french expressions which he uses, instead of your own simple straight forward &amp; far more agreeable style. I have no doubt you have without perceiving it got to embody your ideas in his poetical language &amp; from his being a foreigner it does not sound unnatural in him— Remember, this criticism only applies to parts of your journal, the greatest part I liked exceedingly &amp; could find no fault, &amp; all of it I had the greatest pleasure in reading—</p>
<p>Susan I dare say told you in her letter to Valparaiso dated 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. of October of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Howels delight at receiving an order of shoes from you, this letter will go with them &amp; with the books &amp;<hi rend="superscript">tc</hi>. that Erasmus sends. I have sent you a few little books which are talked about by every body at present—written by Miss Martineau who I think had been hardly heard of before you left England. She is now a great Lion in London, much patronized by L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Brougham who has set her to write stories on the poor Laws—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Erasmus knows her &amp; is a very great admirer &amp; every body reads her little books &amp; if you have a dull hour you can, and then throw them overboard, that they may not take up your precious room— I was very glad you have more space now than at first &amp; particularly glad you have a servant as that must be a comfort to you. I also send Whately (Archbishop of Dublin’s) Scripture Revelations<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I like it so very much &amp; I think we often used to find we liked the same kind of books—</p>
<p>The papers now are very full of Captain Ross’s safe return,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> he seems to be quite satisfied with what he has done in finding there is no passage south of 74<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, but I should have thought it very poor satisfaction for the misery &amp; sufferings he has gone through— Catty &amp; I have been passing a very quiet week together whilst Susan, Papa &amp; Harry have been Cathedral hunting Papa has enjoyed very much all he has seen Susan says in her letter &amp; tomorrow we expect them home again— I wish I could think of any home events— Cath I am sure will have told you all Owen gossip &amp; I have been so busy the last month regulating my new Infant School that I could only give you a journal of the childrens progress in ba-be bi— I rejoice to find the more you see of the negro’s the better you think of them &amp; it is delightful to think in a few years we shall have no more slaves—that alone is enough to make one properly value this Parliament it is my turn to write next month &amp; as in the interim I shall go to Maer, my next letter will be a Wedgwood one I dread the time you are looking forward to with such eagerness, for when once in the South seas there will be an end of regular correspondence &amp; I wish you could see the happiness a letter from you gives to every one— dearest Charles good bye. Y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> affly C D.</p>
