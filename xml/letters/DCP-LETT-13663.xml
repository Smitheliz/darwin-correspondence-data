            <p>Thanks for writing. Had disbelieved the story. He has seen Dr Hahn’s slides and it is clear that Hahn cannot distinguish between mineral and organic structures.</p>

<p>I am greatly obliged to you for the trouble which you have taken in writing to me on the subject of the statement in Science<ref target="#foot.f1"/>   Either D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hahn or the writer of that paragraph, is as I suspect, a person of vivid imagination and inaccurate habits— I disbelieved it when I read it from à priori reasons, but in contradicting a statement one likes to have something better than one’s own conception of the possible or impossible in another person—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I saw a few of Dr Hahns slides but did not look at many because I saw enough to perceive it would be a waste of time, as he clearly could not distinguish between mineral and organic structures. Such as I saw were not unfamiliar to me as a microscopic petrologist and very different to those organic structures with which occasional work with foraminifera and their slices of sedimentary rocks had acquainted me.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>As regards Eozoon, though I admit the question is not without its difficulties, I think the evidence in favour of its being an organic structure is rather strong—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The particular direction my researches have taken have made me very familiar with olivine rock serpentine, devitrified glassy rocks, and many kinds of metamorphic sedimentary rocks, and I have very rarely seen structures at all parallel.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The structure most nearly and commonly paralleled is the ‘nummuline layer’ of the ‘proper wall’—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have occasionally seen structures something like—though the resemblance is but distant—to the canal system—and of course one has sometimes rocks irregularly banded with more than one mineral</p>
<p>Now there seem to me two strong arguements in favour of the organic origin— One. that Carpenter Dawson &amp;c positively assert that you have the ‘canal system’ sometimes preserved by infiltration with more than one mineral (in one case with three) I have seen nothing like this in a mineral imitative structure, and it seems to me most improbable that it can occur except in an organism—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The other: that supposing you get to some minerals or rocks—a sort of chamber like banding— in others occasionally (but seldom) something like the nummuline layer, in others (very rarely) a rude approximation to the canal system— the chance of these three structures being found, and rather persistently, in a large mass of rock is extremely small, unless, seeing they do meet in certain organisms, the specimen has had an organic origin.—</p>
<p>Still I think that it is more prudent to wait for further evidence before building any theories on Eozoon as a foundation—</p>
<p>With many thanks for your kindness in writing | I am Dear Sir | Very faithfully yours | J. G Bonney</p>

Hahn believed he had found various organisms in a stony (chondritic) meteorite. CD had told Hahn that if his observations were verified by several judges, he would have made ‘one of the most remarkable discoveries ever recorded’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 28, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12929F.xml">letter to Otto Hahn, 20 December 1880</ref>). The journal <hi rend="italic">Science</hi> had reported that Hahn visited CD to show him microscopic slides and claimed that CD, on viewing these, exclaimed, ‘what a wonderful discovery!’ (<hi rend="italic">Science</hi>, 27 August 1881, p. 410).</note>

Further samples were sent to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_839.xml">William Benjamin Carpenter</ref>, an expert on Foraminifera, who confirmed Dawson’s interpretation (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1267.xml">Carpenter 1864</ref>). CD added information on the discovery of <hi rend="italic">Eozoon canadense</hi> to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6017.xml"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> 4th ed.</ref>, p. 371, as substantiating his claim, made in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 307, that life existed before the Silurian period. The interpretation of the samples as pre-Silurian fossils remained controversial, however (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1270.xml">Carpenter 1866</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4360.xml">King and Rowney 1866</ref>), and by the end of the century, comparisons with similar, more recent, formations indicated that the samples were mineral in origin (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5929.xml">O’Brien 1970</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6974.xml">Schopf 2000</ref>).</note>
