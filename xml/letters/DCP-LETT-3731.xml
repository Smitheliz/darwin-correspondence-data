<p>Geological Survey Office Christchurch NZ. 9 June 1862.</p>
<p>My dear Sir!</p>
<p>I can not tell you, how thankful I am for your kind letter of the 22 Decb,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> which I received a fortnight ago with all my mails of three months in a lonely shepherd hut at the Alpine lake Pukaki.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Your judgement on my Nelson Rapport is very kind and the same complaint, that there is no map with it, has been made to me from different sides, but the Nelson Government was afraid of the costs.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Although I had no instructions from you, I have collected quite after your wishes, and you will find many interesting undescribed plants in the collection, which I shall forward as soon as the box arrives in which it is contained; probably in three weeks.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Of course I have not forgotten the grasses, amongst which are many remarkable Alpine forms.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Our mountains are unfortunately so very inaccessible and my occupations so varied, that it is only with great difficulty, that I can find the time for collecting.</p>
<p>I shall accompany the plants with a general description of the country, which, as I hope, will give you a clear insight into the general distribution of the vegetation. There are some very interesting observations which I was able to make.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hector is safely arrived. He sent me your letter and wrote me.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Of course I offered him the hand of friendship and can assure you that I am very glad, that another member of the hammer and such a distinguished one is in New Zealand, so as to be able to consult with him about any difficult geological question. If I find the time I shall go over to Dunedin and see him. I have to thank you very much indeed for your great kindness in giving me such manifold information on scientific subjects of the day and if your time allows you I should be delighted, if in future letters you would do the same</p>
<p>A few days ago I came back from my wanderings; the winter set in very soon, so that having the snow feet deep on the mountains, I was obliged to retreat. My journey has been a very interesting one and as I am so very much pressed with official business, I send you this time only the small accounts, which I published in one of our newpapers.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> You will find an account of my Exploration of last year, when Poor D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sinclair lost his life in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Victoria.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Being now naturalized,<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I think it my duty to offer my work to the scientific societies in England. And as I know, that you are also a fellow of the Geological Society, I shall take the liberty to send you in a few months as soon as my map is finished an account of the geological features of the Alps, on deposits of the glacial periods, accompanied by Maps, sections and sketches, which perhaps you will have the kindness to lay before the Geological Society.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> In October last I sent a Copy of my Nelson Map to Arrowsmith, requesting him to lay it before the R. G. Society, but I got no answer.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> If you see him by chance in one of the meetings, would you perhaps be so kind as to ask him, if he has received my letter with this map?</p>
<p>Our Alps are really superb; the glaciers all of such large dimensions and splendour that it is quite impossible to give an adequate description of it. Why do you not come and make a journey through our Alps?!<ref target="#foot.f16"/> It would amply repay costs and trouble and I should be highly delighted, were I allowed to act as your Cicerone.</p>
<p>Hoping that you have safely received the box of plants with the Chrysolishe and to hear from you, I remain | my dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | Julius Haast. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Following the discovery of gold in the province of Otago in 1861, Haast, who was made provincial geologist for Canterbury in that year, set out at the end of January 1862 to search for gold-bearing deposits in the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and to continue there the regular work of the geological survey of the province. He returned to Christchurch at the end of May 1862 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3229.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">H. F. von Haast 1948</ref>, pp. 199–219).</note>

In November 1859, Haast had been appointed by the provincial government of Nelson province, New Zealand, to conduct a topographical and geological survey of its western district between January and August 1860. The provincial government had originally intended to illustrate the report with maps and plants, but in the event, declined to do so on the grounds of expense, ‘much to the disgust of Haast and others’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3229.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">H. F. von Haast 1948</ref>, pp. 47, 105).

Having collected many new plants, Haast sent them to Hooker in August 1862, with a friend who was travelling to Europe ‘by the overland route’. See the letter from Haast to Hooker, dated 10 August 1862, which is in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (Director’s Correspondence 174 (New Zealand letters, 1854–1900: 276)). Hooker, who had published a flora of New Zealand following his own visit there (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3764.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D. Hooker 1853–5</ref>), used them in preparing his government-sponsored <hi rend="italic">Handbook of the New Zealand flora</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3791.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D. Hooker 1864–7</ref>, p. 12*).

In his <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Haast of 22 December 1861</ref> (H. F. von Haast 1848, p. 250), Hooker had mentioned that he intended to give Hector a letter of introduction to Haast, continuing: ‘I am sure you will find him a most agreeable and worthy coadjutor’. Hector wrote to Haast on 19 April 1862, enclosing Hooker’s letter of introduction.</note>

Haast apparently refers to his paper, ‘On the physical geography and geology of New Zealand, principally in reference to the Southern Alps’, which was read before the Royal Society of Victoria on 26 May 1862 (see <hi rend="italic">Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria</hi> 6 (1865), Proceedings, p. xv); however, the paper was subsequently lost, and was consequently not published (<hi rend="italic">Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria</hi> 6 (1865): vi). Hooker and Sinclair had collected plants together in New Zealand in 1841, and Hooker dedicated his <hi rend="italic">Flora Novæ-Zelandiæ</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3764.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D.
