<p>I see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox has Pulmonaria out, and he says it is well out in the woods. Do you want any points looked at or want any plants? I can run over next Sunday to the same old wood near Cowes &amp; should enjoy the expedition.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>My stay here is very pleasant, as they are all very friendly and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox very kind &amp; pleasant to listen to; there are 3 sisters 2 boys at home, and 3 friends staying besides me, so we are chuck full.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>It is the best house in Sandown with a nice Garden &amp; fair view. The garden is overrun with thoroughbred fowls &amp; tame wild ducks; &amp; heaps of dogs about the place.</p>
<p>Sandown is really a far nicer place than I remembered it, I prefer it to Shanklin now.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am very glad I have made the Fox, acquaintance &amp; shall come over again during the summer.</p>
<p>I have just been to evening church, as they all went, and am only now shaking off my rage against the sermon; we had a beautiful organ which kept me cooler.</p>
<p>We have a tremendous lot of talk about your Father<ref target="#foot.f5"/> whom M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Fox seems to admire more than anyone he has known.</p>
