<p>Whilst I think of it let me tell you that years ago I remember seeing in the Museum of the Geolog. Soc. a tooth of Hippopotamus from <hi rend="underline">Madagascar</hi>: this on geographical and all other grounds ought to be looked to.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Pray make a note of this fact. We have returned a week ago from Ilkley, and it has done me some decided good. In London I saw Lyell (the poor man who has “rushed into the bosom of two heresies”) (by the way I saw his celts, and how intensely interesting)<ref target="#foot.f2"/> and he told me that you were very antagonistic to my views on species. I well knew this would be the case. I must freely confess the difficulties and objections are terrific; but I cannot believe that a false theory would explain, as it seems to me it does explain, so many classes of facts. Do you ever see Wollaston; He and You would agree nicely about my Book,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> —ill-luck to both of you. If you have anything <hi rend="underline">at</hi> <hi rend="underline">all</hi> pleasant for me to hear do write; and if all that you can say is very unpleasant, it will do you good to expectorate. And it is well known that you are very fond of writing letters.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Farewell my good old friend and enemy.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>Do make a note about the Hippopotamus. If you are such a gentleman as to write pray tell me how Torquay agrees with your health</p>
