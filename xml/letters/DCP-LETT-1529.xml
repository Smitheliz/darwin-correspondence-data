<p>I have no remarks at all worth sending you; nor indeed was it likely that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>., considering how perfect &amp; elaborated an essay it is. As far as my judgment goes, it is the most important discussion on the points in question, ever published. I can say no more.— I agree with almost everything you say; but I require much time to digest an essay of such quality. It almost made me gloomy, partly from feeling I could not answer some points which theoretically I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have liked to have been different; &amp; partly from seeing <hi rend="underline">so far better done</hi> <hi rend="underline">than I could</hi> have done, discussions on some points which I had intended to have taken up.</p>
<p>Now for a few mere details,— diag p. 30. Bory St Vincent Voyage dans les quatre principales iles des mers d’Afrique (1801. 1802).—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> p. 31. Lindley <hi rend="underline">quite lately</hi> stated that the sexual structure of Ferns as just discovered, showed that hybridising was very possible.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> p. 33. “such a view”, I think this expression wants expanding p. 37. “from whence” I hate this expletive; is not whence enough? p. 41. in case of the Edwardsia &amp; Oxalis, when you speak of the current being opposed to their distribution, does this not imply that you suppose they have started from one or the other end ie E. or W? or does it refer to the Polar current flowing north-ward?<ref target="#foot.f4"/> p. 42 this page, I think, rather less clear than elsewhere, though I can hardly tell why. p. 43 About fewness of the species in the same genus in islands: are there are not some strongish exceptions to this; I have vague memory of your having given me some cases of an opposite tendency; but I presume my memory errs.</p>
<p>How striking, &amp; well you put the case of absent Eucalyptis in N.Z.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> at p. 71, where you speak of the 5 compositæ, the expressions of “occurring in <hi rend="underline">so many parts</hi> of the world” &amp; “in having met in that most isolated spot”, struck me as rather contradictory; but I presume I do not quite see your bearing.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Could you add to your discussion by stating which of the Europæan plants are absent in the districts between Europe &amp; N. Zealand? p. 72. sentence with X for a moment puzzled me. What a noble tribute you pay to Lyell &amp; Forbes:<ref target="#foot.f7"/> they will I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think, be very much gratified.—ramme</p>
<p>I much enjoyed the slaps you have given to the provincial species-mongers.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I wish I could have been of the slightest use: I have been deeply interested by the whole essay; &amp; congratulate you on having produced a memoir which I believe will be memorable.— I was deep in it, when your most considerate note arrived, begging me not to hurry: I thank M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Hooker &amp; yourself most sincerely for your wish to see me: I will not let another summer pass without seeing you at Kew, for indeed I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. enjoy it much. I grieve &amp; rejoice at the probable news, about Forbes &amp; Edinburgh.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>By the way the discussion about Forbes &amp; Watson must have been rather ticklish work.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> You do me really more honour than I have any claim to, putting me in after Lyell on ups &amp; downs.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> In a year or two’s time, when I shall be at my species book, (if I do not break down) I shall gnash my teeth &amp; abuse you for having put so many hostile facts so confoundedly well.</p>

Therefore, they may be expected to intermix and produce hybrids. It has been, indeed, long since asserted that true hybrid Ferns exist in the case of Gymnogrammas. This, although doubted by almost every body, now seems to be quite possible, and if so, we may expect other Ferns of hybrid origin to be in time produced, if they do not already exist.’ Although Hooker referred to hybrid ferns in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3764.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D.
