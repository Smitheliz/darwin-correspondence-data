        <abstract>
            <p>CK is drawn into discussions of Darwinism everywhere in Cambridge. The climate has changed in the past three years: the younger M.A.s are greedy to know more and the criticism of the older Fellows has a new tone.</p>

<p>I have been here 3 or 4 days;<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; have been accidentally drawn, again &amp; again, into what the world calls Darwinism, &amp; you &amp; I &amp; some others fact &amp; science— I have been drawn thereinto, simply because I find everyone talking about it to anyone who is supposed to know (or mis-know) anything about it: all shewing how men’s minds are stired.</p>
<p>I find the best &amp; strongest men coming over. I find one or 2 of them like Adams (&amp; Cayley) fighting desperately.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>1. Because, being really great men, they know so much already w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. they cannot coordinate with your theories (at least as yet) &amp; say (as they have a right) “I will stand by what I do know from mathematics, before I give in to what I <hi rend="underline">dont</hi> know from ——</p>
<p>That last dash is the key of the position. They dont know. The dear good fellows have been asking me questions.—e.g. “You dont say that there are links between a cat &amp; a dog? If so, what are they?— To w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. I have been forced to answer—my dear fellow, you must read &amp; find out for yourself— I am not bound to answer such a question as that. I am not bound to teach you the <hi rend="underline">alphabet</hi>, while you are solemnly disputing about my translation of the <hi rend="underline">language</hi>.</p>
<p>That is what it comes to, my dear &amp; honoured <hi rend="underline">master</hi>, for so I call you openly where I can, among “great swells’, as well as here in Cambridge— Why men dont agree with you, is because they dont know facts: &amp; what I do is—simply to say to every one, as I have been doing for 3 days past “Will you kindly ascertain a few facts—or at least ascertain what facts there are, to be known or disproved, before you talk on this matter at all?”—&amp; I find, in Cambridge, that the younger M.A’s. are not only willing, but greedy, to hear what you have to say; &amp; that the elder, (who have of course more old notions to overcome) are facing the whole question in a quite different tone from what they did 3 years ago. I wont mention names for fear of “compromising” men who are in an honest, but “funky” stage of conversion: but I have been surprised, coming back for 3 or 4 days, at the change since last winter.</p>
<p>I trust you will find the good old university (w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. has always held to physical science &amp; free thought—&amp; allows—as she always has done—anybody to believe anything reasonable, <hi rend="underline">provided he dont quarrel with his neighbours</hi>) to be your finest standing ground in these isles.</p>
<p>I say this—especially now—because you will get, I suppose, an attack on you by an anonymous “Graduate of Cambridge”<ref target="#foot.f3"/>—w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. I found in the hands of at least one very wise &amp; liberal man—who admired it very much—but knew nothing of <hi rend="underline">The Facts</hi>: he shewed it me, &amp; in the first 3 pages I opened at hazard, I pointed him out 2 or 3 capital cases of ignorance or omission, on w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. I declined to read any more of the book, as coming from a man who knew—or did not choose to know—anything about <hi rend="underline">The Facts</hi>. He was astonished, when I told him that the man was an ignoramus, or worse, &amp; could be proved such. &amp; I think I have done him good. &amp; so it will be with many more—</p>
<p>Excuse the bad writing— I have a pen w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. if natural selection influenced pens, w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have been cast into the fire long ago: but the disturbing moral element makes me too lazy to cast it thereinto—&amp; to find a new one.</p>
<p>I have—as usual—a thousand questions to ask you—&amp; no time, nor brain, to ask them now.</p>
<p>But ever I am— | Your affte pupil | C Kingsley</p>
<p>Dont trouble yourself to answer me. But if you write to me, I return to Eversley tomorrow.<ref target="#foot.f4"/>—<hi rend="underline">&amp; give my love to Lubbock</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
