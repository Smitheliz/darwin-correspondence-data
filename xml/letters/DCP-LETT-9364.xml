            <p>Thanks CD for his opinion on egging. Despite the intensity of the practice sufficient eggs always remain to carry on the breed.</p>

                    <salute>My dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin,</salute>

<p>I am much obliged for your opinion on egging— The instance of Northern breeding-places of Sea-birds is very apposite—though it was well known to me—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> There the egging is so well done—that, except in a few inaccessible spots, literally every egg is taken up to a certain date—after which the birds are no more molested.— There must be hardly any places in England if any at all where the eggs of land-birds are so completely taken—some nests &amp; often many nearly always escaping observation— Thus in either case sufficient is left to carry on the breed.</p>
<p>I have looked at the passage in S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. John’s ‘Tour’ to which you have kindly referred me—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I had forgotten its existence. What he says is to the point and a matter of opinion, but he does not enter enough into details— The experience of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Rivers is valuable—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> My friend M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Pickard-Cambridge, of Spider fame, assures me that it is only of late years that the Bullfinches have begun to pick the buds in his own &amp; other orchards in Dorset to any great extent.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I do not see why the habits of birds are not to change. In this case it may be that some new insect infesting buds has introduced itself to the locality— We know that round oak gall has spread within the last 20 years in a wonderful way—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Believe me | Y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. very truly | Alfred Newton</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Round oak galls, also known as oak marble galls, are produced on the Turkey oak (<hi rend="italic">Quercus cerris</hi>), introduced into Britain in 1735, and on the native oak (<hi rend="italic">Q. robur</hi>) by the larvae of the cynipid wasp <hi rend="italic">Andricus kollari</hi>, which was introduced into Devon around 1830. The wasp spread across Britain, reaching Scotland by the 1870s. See P. Walker <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> 2002, pp. 336–7 and 346. In the 1850s, the increase in numbers of oak galls was widely noted when it was thought that the galls might ruin the acorn crop used to feed pigs (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7403.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Stainton 1855</ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle</hi>, 1 December 1855, pp. 789–90).</note>
