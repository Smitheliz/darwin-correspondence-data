<p>You will have been anxious to know we doubt not how the Mount house &amp; Gardener’s cottage stand as to prospect of sale &amp; the present arrangements.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The house is at present let temporarily terminable by a month’s notice to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. G. B. Watton with a view to keep it aired &amp;c at the rate of £11 a month you paying the taxes. Wynne the gardener has been allowed to retain the cottage rent free but he is quite incapacitated for work. His wife and sons have had charge of the house until M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Watton occupied it &amp; have kept that and the grounds in order. They ask for some allowance as they cannot live in the house earning nothing and it seems reasonable something should be allowed them for work done if not for the future though of course they do not expect gardener’s wages but desire to leave the matter in your hands. Their wages were £5<hi rend="superscript">.</hi>10/— a month.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. C. Parker<ref target="#foot.f3"/> have been here to day &amp; it is proposed to advertise the property for immediate sale offering the house first in one Lot, &amp; if not sold then the whole property in four Lots. <hi rend="underline">Lot 1</hi> the gardener’s cottage, <hi rend="underline">Lot 2</hi> the House, (described as being capable of being made into 2 good Dwellings) but excluding the kitchen garden which would be severed for a separate building lot and excluding the Hill Head Bank field above the house.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Lot 3</hi> the Kitchen garden with an approah by S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. George’s Church.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Lot 4</hi> the Hill Head Bank field</p>
<p>Lots 1, 3, &amp; 4 we should be sanguine of selling &amp; the mode proposed would we think be the most likely way of selling lot 2 and would be more within the compass of an ordinary buyer.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>As regards Wynne M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F Parker suggests that if the property is sold something should be given to Wynne in one sum as finally settling with him. If not all sold you would know what is likely to be wanted from him for the future but he desires that you should express your wishes on the subject.</p>
<p>Both M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F. &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. C. Parker would attend the sale for which a separate valuation would be forwarded to you &amp; we should suggest a discretionary power as to the price of the lots should be left with them. A duplicate of this letter will be sent to each branch of the family &amp; we shall be obliged if you will express any views that occur to you</p>
<p>We are Dear Sir | With Great Respect | Your obliged &amp; faithful Servants | Salt &amp; Sons <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
