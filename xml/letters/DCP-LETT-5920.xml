                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I was just about to write 〈    〉 and to return my sincere 〈thanks〉 for having sent me your new w〈ork〉<ref target="#foot.f2"/> when your letter from the 23<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. febr. arrived in my hands. I hasten to answer it meanwhile; as soon as my negotiations with Engelmann in Leipzig will have had a result, I shall give you further account.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am perfectly sure that my brother will like to see his work “Für Darwin” translated in English.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> For when I engaged him to publish his various observations on Orchids, mentioned in his letters to me, in a detailed work, he declared, that he did not intend to publish some unconnected facts, but if in future he should succeed in detecting facts worth of being published separately, he would wait till he were capable of writing the work in English, his pri〈ncipal〉 correspondents being Engli〈sh〉<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>〈    〉 besides this motive I am fully 〈convi〉nced that my brother would 〈agre〉e with all his heart to this 〈tra〉nslation, barely because you 〈express〉 〈i〉nterest in it and he feels the 〈hi〉ghest respect for you.</p>
<p>Therefore as far as my brother is concerned you can effect the translation without any scruple and without any suspence. In order to reduce as far as possible the delay effected by the slow expedition of letters to and from Brasilia (commonly nearly three months pass away before answer from Brasilia arrives.) I have communicated to my brother the contents of your letter, immedately after having received it; I have entreated him to send you as soon as possible the corrections he has possibly to make and some additions. In the mean time Mr. Dallas could effect his translation.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Also to Engelmann of Leipzig I have written immediately and though I do not know on what terms he has 〈pub〉lished m〈y〉 brothers book I cannot think that he could have any motive of refusing the use of the woodcuts. I think it will be only very honorable and profitable to his publications if they are translated in English. I hope I shall be able to send you soon the result of my negotiations with him.</p>
<p>Your thanks for the Bot. Zeitung depend I suppose on a mistake, as I never have sent you one. Prof. de Bary, editor of the Bot. Zeitung, has given lately a review of the Article which I formerly have sent to you. Perhaps he has sent you a copy of it?<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>The translation of your new work which you have had the kindness to send me, has been to me an abundant source of delight and of information. I cannot but pay you anew my fullest admiration. You have not only led over the whole consideration of the organic world from a though[t]less description of forms to an understanding of the causal connection, but at the same time you have given to the science a plenty of new and important facts the investigation of which would have required the whole energy of at least a dozen excellent naturalists. The good effects of your theorie on the Origine of species are to be remarked in ever larger circles. Lately again I have had the pleasure to hear that two of my correspondents have become ardent followers of your theories: Dr Speyer, known as a perfect connoisseur of Germain Lepidoptera is about to show the descent of the Lepidoptera from the Phryganidae<ref target="#foot.f8"/> (I have sent him my collection of Westfalian Phryganidae for his exploration); another friend of mine, Röse, is about to explain the genealogical connection of some mosses.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Every one who has been instructed by the reading of your works is full of admiration and of thanks for you.</p>
<p>Receive, my dear Sir, also my sincere thanks and the assurance of my greatest respect. | I remain | Yours very faithfully | H Müller.</p>
