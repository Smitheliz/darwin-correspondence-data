                <div type="transcription">
<p>Your letter of August 30, with the papers which you were so good as to send me, reached me only a short time since, owing to the protracted illness and absence from London of Mr. Morris,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> through whom they were sent. I have lately heard from Mr. Morris that you wish to dispose of your fossil remains on some pecuniary arrangement, which I did not fully understand from your own letter to me. I have given Mr. Morris my opinion on this head, so will not here repeat it; but will only say that I conceive the only feasible plan would be to send your fossils here to some agent to dispose of them.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> No society will purchase anything of the kind without having them inspected, and most societies only receive presents. Your specimen of the Muñi-felis must be a noble one; I suspect it will turn out to be a Machairodus, of which there are some fragments in the British Museum from the Pampas. I will endeavour to get your paper translated and inserted in some scientific periodical.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Your account of the earthquake in the Pampas has surprised me; I never heard of one in any part further east of the Cordillera than at Cordoba. If you will inform me whether you read English I shall be happy to send you a copy (if you will point out some channel) of my “Geological Observations on South America,” lately published; I do not think it worth sending them without knowing whether you read English, which I fear is not probable. Your pamphlet on the scarlet fever I will present to the Royal College of Surgeons.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I cannot adequately say how much I admire your continued zeal, situated as you are without means of pursuing your scientific studies and without people to sympathise with you, for the advancement of natural history; I trust that the pleasure of your pursuits affords you some reward for your exertions. Some time since you were so kind as to send me through Mr. E. Lumb<ref target="#foot.f6"/> some <hi rend="underline">most curious</hi>, and to me <hi rend="underline">most</hi> <hi rend="underline">valuable</hi>, information regarding the Niata oxen.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I should be deeply obliged by any further facts about any of the <hi rend="underline">domestic</hi> animals of La Plata; on the origin of any “breed” of poultry, pigs, dogs, cattle, etc. I should be much interested by a brief description of the habits and appearance of the pigs, dogs, etc., which have <hi rend="underline">run wild</hi>, and especially on the habits of these wild breeds, when their young are caught and reared. Will a puppy of one of the run-wild dogs, if brought up carefully, be as tame as a common dog? <hi rend="underline">Any</hi> information on <hi rend="underline">all</hi> such points would be of <hi rend="underline">real service</hi> to me; and my address, should you find time to write to me, will always be that at the head of this letter. I most sincerely wish you all success in your admirable labours, and if at any time I can be of any service, I shall be happy to be so; but I am sorry to say I am not connected with any mercantile establishment and cannot recommend agents, etc., etc. With much respect, I beg to remain, Sir, | Your obliged and obedient servant, | CHARLES DARWIN.</p>
<p>P.S.—I omitted to state that Prof. Owen has heard that a collection of bones from Buenos Aires some time since arrived at Paris.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
