<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a1" type="annotationStart"/>All investigations have an interest in my eyes, which bear upon the grand question, whether species are or are not absolutely &amp; always distinct;—or on the various secondary questions connected with or arising out of the former. Thus, you may correctly believe that I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> take an interest in your investigations about the numerical evidences or indications of variability.<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> There seems to be this difference between us, that you regard the proportions as approximating more towards evidences of a general law, while I see them only as fainter indications of it. The technical groups of botany, Orders &amp; genera, appear to me to be formed in a mode that is too arbitrary &amp; multi-form to admit of your inquiry being worked out to very reliable results.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> This would still introduce much uncertainty into the results, even supposing Botanists better agreed than they are likely to be in our day, as to what (or which) are species &amp; what are varieties. Really, they can neither define what species are, nor can they empirically agree in selecting species from varieties, or varieties from species.— Jordan would make a million species. J. D. Hooker would perhaps allow 50,000.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Looking to the sources of doubt &amp; difficulty, I should rather seek the proportions by bringing together the three categories of quasi-species (or quasi-varieties) into which I marked the London Catalogue. Uniting the 69, 195, 32 into 296 debateable species <anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>you obtain a goodly group of ‘forms’ which are <hi rend="underline">in fact</hi> held species by some, and varieties by other botanists.<anchor xml:id="ann.a4" type="annotationEnd"/> Their disseverance into three groups, say  + probable species = possible species – probable varieties is matter <hi rend="underline">of opinion</hi>; &amp; if you tried half a dozen botanists among those most attentive to such points, likely no two of them would concur in their grouping of the forms into the three sets.</p>
<p>The London Catalogue would of course only show one set of varieties. My purpose in marking also the more debateable species, &amp; adding Babington’s varieties<ref target="#foot.f3"/> (being also quasi-species) was as much that of augmenting the total group, as of showing three grades.</p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a5" type="annotationStart"/>There are some species of plants which vary so much that botanists seldom attempt to name &amp; describe the varieties.<anchor xml:id="ann.a6" type="annotationEnd"/> Such species consequently stand in lists with no varieties or very few, altho’ in fact they have them most numerous. Polygonum aviculare is an example in point. Say that three or six of its varieties had been brought hither from as many <anchor xml:id="ann.a7" type="annotationStart"/>different &amp; distant Countries, instead of being all home-grown, they would surely have been duly named &amp; described as three or six species. As it stands in the London Catalogue, Polygonum is a large genus (13 species) with one variety only.<anchor xml:id="ann.a8" type="annotationEnd"/> Looking to nature’s facts, it might as truly have had half a dozen or upwards.</p>
<p>I must confess a pretty strong bias towards the view, that species are <hi rend="doubleUnderline">not</hi> immutably distinct;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> —altho’ in our time-narrowed observation of the individuals they seem to be so.</p>
<p>Very truly yours | Hewett C. Watson <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> To | C. Darwin | Esq</p>
