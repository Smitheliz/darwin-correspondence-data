                    <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I have read with interest D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Huggins’s letter with your introduction to it in “Nature”.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Is it not just <hi rend="underline">possible</hi> that in all the cases mentioned a nervous temperament in this family of dogs was suddenly and painfully excited by the smell of meat; just as some persons are excited by the smell of cheese: leaving only the <hi rend="underline">temperament</hi> to be <hi rend="underline">inherited</hi>. Mr Wallace makes in his letter of this week to “Nature” a most ingenious hypothesis for the “homing” faculty in Animals<ref target="#foot.f2"/>—basing it on association through the sense of <hi rend="underline">smell</hi>—but as long as we do not <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that this sense is so used, is it not more probable that the animals taken from home blindfold had had some previous <hi rend="underline">experimental</hi> knowledge of the country passed over, though, through inattention to their habits, we <hi rend="underline">have not observed the means</hi> <hi rend="underline">by which they</hi> acquired it?</p>
<p>I cannot get a good case of “homing” where the following conditions have been <hi rend="underline">undoubtedly</hi> fulfilled. 1. That the animal is <hi rend="underline">known certainly</hi> to have had no opportunity, either alone or with some person, of acquiring any knowledge of the road. 2. That the return has been effected within such a time as the animal would ordinarily have occupied in travelling the distance. People let their dogs wander about the country on their own business until nearly full grown. (I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that they travel many miles on their own account) then give them away to some person, say 20 miles off, and are astonished(!) to see the animals come back in a few days (not hours) emaciated and dirty and with their nails worn down to the quick. In fact just as they have been poking about like a man in the dark to find a landmark. But a little touching up perhaps sends the story into a respectable journal, <hi rend="underline">deprived</hi> of all the data by which we can recognize its true significance. A case occurred lately in this house which <hi rend="underline">looked</hi> like an undoubted case of “homing” and I allowed many persons to think so; and no one in the world besides myself happened to have seen how the <hi rend="underline">experimental</hi> knowledge was gained. I have published <hi rend="doubleUnderline">my</hi> account of the case <hi rend="underline">with</hi> the explanation and others have published it without.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I cannot satisfy myself of a single instance where conditions 1 and. 2 have been fulfilled and until then I must believe that these cases no more show <hi rend="underline">instinct</hi> than does the “homing” of the pigeon.</p>
<p>With apologies for troubling you I am, Dear Sir, yours faithfully Arthur Nicols. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4935.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Russel Wallace’s</ref> letter on inherited feeling appeared in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, 20 February 1873, p. 303. Wallace suggested that the antipathy to butchers in dogs mentioned in Huggins’s letter could have resulted from inheriting a sensitivity to a smell associated with pain, on the assumption that an ancestor of the dogs had been mistreated by butchers. He further suggested that an acute sense of smell was responsible for the homing ability displayed by some animals.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Nicols’s published account has not been identified, but in <hi rend="italic">Natural history sketches among the Carnivora</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5874.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Nicols 1885</ref>, pp. 195–6), Nicols related the story of a dog that supposedly had returned home to Hampstead after being given to someone in Essex. Nicols mentioned that an account of the incident had been published before he discovered that the dog had not, in fact, made the whole journey, but had been transported back to London and then found its way home by no doubt familiar routes.</note>
