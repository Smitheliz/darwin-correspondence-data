<p>Do you mean to cut the connection; why do you not write? I sent the last letter; so by the laws of nations you ought to have written.— I was in such bustle, when I last wrote to you: that I really forget how our various money transactions go on.— I will state them.— I have in my possession your 5£: I have paid Aiken 2"13"6. But have not paid Bakers bill, (not having seen him) which amounts 5<hi rend="superscript">£</hi>"3<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>"6 including 12<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. for apples for Henslows— I shall start for Cambridge tomorrow week: but shall stay a few days in London to hear Operas &amp;c &amp;c.— Let me have a letter from you waiting at Cambridge, or before I go there: I will settle all your affairs for you.—</p>
<p>I expect to spend a very pleasant Spring term: walking &amp; botanizing with Henslow: I suppose it is out of the question, your snatching a Parsons week<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; running up to Cambridge. I think you would enjoy; I am sure I should;— Think of it.—</p>
<p>At present, I talk, think, &amp; dream of a scheme I have almost hatched of going to the Canary Islands.— I have long had a wish of seeing Tropical scenery &amp; vegetation: &amp; according to Humboldt<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Teneriffe is a very pretty specimen.—</p>
<p>Looking over your letter I find there is a bill Orridges, is it distinct from the 2<hi rend="superscript">£</hi>"13"6?</p>
<p>If you are not busy, you had better write to me before tomorrow week, &amp; give me circumstantial account of every thing that you can think of.— How all your family are? &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
<p>Believe me dear old Fox | Most sincerely | Chas Darwin *S 2</p>
