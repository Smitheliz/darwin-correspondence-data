                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>

                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>Accept my warmest thanks for your kind present of combs and workers of apis testacea.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have examined them carefully and with the greatest interest   The cells appear precisely the same as those of A. mellifica with this important difference—the breeding cells are <hi rend="underline">one-fourth deeper</hi> than those of A mellifica, proving that the insect is <hi rend="underline">one-fourth longer</hi> in the body when it arrives at maturity. It is very remarkable that an insect so much larger than the common bee should build cells of no greater diameter, and satisfies me that I am right in believing A. Ligustica to be a larger bee than A mellifica although it makes cells of the same diameter</p>
<p>What an immense comb yours must have been! Could you ascertain by any means if A testacea is a hive bee? If so I believe it would be invaluable in this country. Its very large wings augur enormous powers of flight and its capacity for honey-gathering is I should think, immense. I really cannot get it out of my head and shall not rest until I have attempted by some means to obtain a living colony.</p>
<p>With regard to living bees from central Africa, I see no very great difficulty in the matter; if the gentleman you mention<ref target="#foot.f2"/> would attempt it I should be happy to give instructions pay expenses of freight &amp;c and if successful and a new species would gladly present the sender with £10 or £20 according to their value, although I can scarcely think they would turn out the extraordinary honey-gatherers which I fancy A testacea to be</p>
<p>One thing appears remarkable, and that is that the melting-point of the wax of A testacea seems <hi rend="underline">lower</hi> than that of A. mellifica</p>
<p>Again thanking you most sincerely I am | My dear Sir | Yours very truly | T W Woodbury <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
<p rend="left">C. Darwin Esq</p>
<p>P.S.— The bees of Jamaica are I believe A mellifa and I doubt not their combs are the same as ours<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD had sent Woodbury a portion of the honeycomb from the island of Timor, sent to him by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4935.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Russel Wallace</ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3496.xml" resp="#automat">letter from A. R. Wallace, 7 April 1862</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3689.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to A. R. Wallace, 20 August [1862]</ref>). Woodbury was one of the contributors to the bee-keeping section of the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Horticulture and Cottage Gardener</hi>, to which CD had recently directed several queries concerning variability in hive-bees (see letters to the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Horticulture</hi>, [before 10 June 1862] and [before 15 July 1862]). Woodbury had written privately to CD in response to the latter of these (see letter to <hi rend="italic">Journal of Horticulture</hi>, [before 22 July 1862]); however, Woodbury’s letter has not been found. According to his ‘Journal’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, Appendix II), CD was writing up the chapter of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> on ‘Silk-worms Geese &amp;c’ in the summer of 1862; this chapter included a section on hive-bees (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 297–9).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">The reference is to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3151.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gustav Mann</ref>, who was collecting in West Africa for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3696.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 22 [August 1862]</ref> and nn. 5 and 6). No letter from CD to Woodbury on this subject has been found; however, CD had evidently been attempting to obtain specimens of bees and honeycomb from West Africa (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3690.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 20 August 1862</ref> and nn. 8 and 9).</note>
