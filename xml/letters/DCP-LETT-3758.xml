<p>You must be a clair-voyant or something of that kind to have sent me such useful plants. Twenty-five years ago I described in my Father’s garden 2 forms of L. flavum (thinking it case of mere variation);<ref target="#foot.f2"/> from that day to this I have several times looked, but never saw the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> form till it arrived from Kew.— Virtue is never its own reward: I took paper this summer to write to you to ask you to send me flowers, that I might beg plants of this Linum, if you had the other form, &amp; refrained from not wishing to trouble you.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But I am now sorry I did; for I have hardly any doubt that L. flavum never seeds in any garden that I have seen, because one form alone is cultivated by slips.—</p>
<p>Secondly I raised a lot of plants from Kew seed marked “L. Austriacum”, but certainly different from the flowers you sent, which no doubt, as Lecoq says,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> are dimorphic. The Kew seedlings 112 in number were not dimorphic &amp; were all self-fertile &amp; I strongly suspect were L. usitatissimum: now it would be of great use to me to know whether you keep seed at Kew of any other <hi rend="underline">blue</hi> Linums,, besides L. perenne, Austriacum &amp; usitatissimum; for my plants were <hi rend="underline">not</hi> the two former, &amp; I could thus perhaps know what they were.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Many thanks for your caution about stigmas of long-styled L. perenne: I knew &amp; think I said that position was due to twisting of style; but I will look more carefully at what period twisting takes place.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>You sent me some most curious plants: what in name of Heaven is name of the genus of which you sent me 3 species, &amp; especially of pinkish-purple flower with long thin nectary: I suppose you sent them from seeing their relation like in orchids to visits of insects.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> If a greenhouse plant I will get this plant.—</p>
<p>I certainly thought that you were author of the excellent review of the orchid book, especially from passage about unisexuality in high plants.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The Reviewer (is it a secret, who?) I daresay is quite right about arrangement of Book; but I hardly know with my materials that I could have made it better.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I wish he would criticize the last chapter; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to hear what a good hand would say to it.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I have not yet had time to examine Lythrum flowers; most cordial thanks for them—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>

CD’s father, Robert Waring Darwin, had resided at The Mount, Shrewsbury.

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3753.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 6 October [1862]</ref> and n. 12. No letter from Oliver discussing this point has been found.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD apparently refers to the flowers of two species of <hi rend="italic">Impatiens</hi> that had in fact been sent at his own request by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref>, together with some flowers of a species of Loasaceae (see letters from J. D. Hooker, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3757.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[12 October 1862]</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3774.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[18 October 1862]</ref>). See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3762.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 14 [October 1862]</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3664.xml" resp="#automat" cert="medium">letter to Oliver of 24 July [1862]</ref>, CD had suggested that Oliver should write a review of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref> for the <hi rend="italic">Natural History Review</hi> (see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3668.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">letter from Oliver, 28 July 1862)</ref>; CD had subsequently asked Hooker to thank Oliver ‘for his clear &amp; favourable notice’ (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3753.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 6 October [1862]</ref>). However, it was Hooker who wrote the review ([J. D. Hooker] 1862d; see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3797.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 7 November 1862</ref>). The review began with a statement that one of the ‘prominent differences between the animal and plant kingdoms’ was that ‘whereas unisexuality is the rule amongst the highest orders of animals, and hermaphroditism becomes more frequent as we descend in the scale, the contrary is the case with plants’ (p. 371). CD’s work, Hooker continued, had shown that ‘amongst many plants apparent and real hermaphroditism are totally different things’, and that ‘before reasoning further on the subject, we must begin again not only to observe, but also to experiment.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">In his review of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref> ([J. D. Hooker] 1862d, p. 373), Hooker argued that the book suffered from a lack of concise headings and from a degree of arbitrariness in the division of the chapters; it was, he stated, as if ‘the conception of putting forth the treatise as a separate work was an after-thought’. He also noted that it was an arrangement that would ‘not recommend itself to the general reader, who thus loses sight of the grand divisions of the Order as well as of the subject.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">In chapter 7 of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, CD discussed the homologies of orchid flowers, and concluded with remarks on natural selection and on the importance of cross-fertilisation (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, pp. 286–360). Hooker concluded his review ([J. D. Hooker 1862d], p. 376) by noting that he had preferred giving an extended synopsis of CD’s observations on British orchids to ‘reviewing the very extensive and intricate chapters devoted to foreign Orchids, the homologies of Orchid flowers, and general considerations’; this, Hooker stated, was because CD’s observations on British orchids could be ‘repeated by any observer and extended by many’, and because such a procedure gave ‘a better idea of the completeness of the work’, in spite of the fact that the ‘other chapters’ were ‘by far the more interesting and important’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">In the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3753.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 6 October [1862]</ref>, CD had asked Hooker for dried flowers of <hi rend="italic">Lythrum Graefferi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L. thymifolia</hi>, if they were readily available in the herbarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Oliver was an assistant in the herbarium. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7749.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Three forms of <hi rend="italic">Lythrum salicaria</hi>’</ref>, p. 190 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 124), CD referred to his having seen two dried flowers of <hi rend="italic">L. thymifolia</hi> from Kew.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12">No reply to this letter has been found. However, on the reverse of the letter Oliver noted: ‘Seed of <hi rend="italic">Linums</hi> dib. | L. hyssopifolia <hi rend="italic">dib.</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">if riper</hi>’. In his letter to CD of 13 September 1862, Oliver reported that he had ‘given directions about saving seed of <hi rend="italic">Lythrum hyssopifolium</hi>’.</note>
