<p>Your last Sunday letter has been forwarded to me here. I am <hi rend="underline">very</hi> glad to hear that you have begun Botany, in the manner in which you have.— I know Hooker thinks very highly of G. Henslow, in all ways.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It has always been a hobby of mine that nothing could be so improving as the practice of describing plants, teaching accurate observation (a faculty which I am sure is <hi rend="underline">most</hi> slowly acquired) &amp; conciseness &amp; accuracy of style. I have always regretted that Henslow had not struck on this plan when I was there, that I might have practised.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You will always be glad that you began this.— By the way, one evening I said to Franky, who is getting on very well in French, that he would be very glad of it, all his future life: &amp; a few days after Lenny was dissecting under my microscope &amp; he turned round very gravely &amp; said “dont you think, papa, that I shall be very glad of this all my future life”.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I came here on last Monday &amp; go home next Monday: it has rested me well, &amp; done my stomach some good. There have been some pleasant &amp; clever men here: one of them writes the Leading articles in the Times &amp; so is a very great man.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I was glad to hear about poor old Impey, who must now be very old:<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I did not at all know that he was a reader. I have lately had splendid luck about striped Horses, for I have got introduced to a Col. Poole, who was employed by gov-ernment to examine horses in a part of India, where most are striped &amp; he tells me that 2 &amp; even 3 shoulder stripes are common there;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> &amp; your case<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
