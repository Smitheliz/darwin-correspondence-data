<p>It may interest you to know that I have succeeded in the task, which has occupied me for some years, of establishing the unity of language in its developement.</p>
                    <p>For this purpose it was necessarily especially to investigate the languages of america under considerable difficulty from deficiency of material, as well as the demand on my time from other occupations.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>So far as I know there is no language, which is separate, &amp; which does not belong to the general stock.</p>
                    <p>On psychological grounds the developement of language means the developement of mythology &amp; of culture. In this respect the nations of the highest advancement bear traces of the early culture of mankind. It may be roughly said there are no languages which are not “black” languages in their ground work</p>
                    <p>The results are of course very different from what Prof Max Muller &amp; philogists have been accustomed to believe.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>It will take many men &amp; many years yet to work out all the details, but, even with what I have already published, there is convincing evidence.</p>
                    <p>As knowing language is so closely connected with nature worship, there is no room for a separate creation of it, which some of our friends believe.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>I have also just found that the idea of Hand, Finger &amp;c is only secondary in numerals, &amp; that 5 &amp; 10 are primarily to be referred to Navel, Belly &amp;c, that is to the early mythology.</p>
                    <p> Yours faithfully | Hyde Clarke </p>
