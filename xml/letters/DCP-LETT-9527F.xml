<p>I dissolved <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> gr. (of cobra-poison)<ref target="#foot.f2"/> in ȝj<ref target="#foot.f3"/> of water, so that I was able to immerse two leaves. It acted as before, but more energetically; and I observed more clearly, this time, that the solution makes the secretion round the glands cloudy, which I have never before observed. But here comes the remarkable point; after an immersion of 48 hours, the protoplasm within the cells incessantly changes form, and I never saw it on any other occasion so active. Hence I cannot doubt that this poison is a stimulant to the protoplasm; and I shall be very curious to find out in your papers whether you have tried its action on the cilia and on the colourless corpuscles of the blood. If the poison does arrest their movement, it will show that there is a profound difference between the protoplasm of animals and of this plant. Therefore if you try any further experiments I hope that you will be so kind as to inform me of the results.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I may add that I tried at first 1 gr. to the ȝj, as that is my standard strength for all substances.</p>
<p>It is certainly very remarkable that the poison should act so differently on the cilia and on the protoplasm of <hi rend="underline">Drosera</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> After the 48 hours’ immersion, I placed the two leaves in water and they partially reexpanded. I thought that the whitened glands were perhaps killed; but those of one leaf which I tried with carbonate of ammonia absorbed it, and the protoplasm was affected in the usual manner. I am very much surprised at the action of the poison on the viscid secretion from the glands, which it coagulates into threads and bits of membrane, with much granular matter. Have you observed whether the poison affects in any marked manner mucus or other such secretions?</p>
