<p>I have been a most ungrateful &amp; ungracious man not to have written to you an immense time ago to thank you heartily for the “Nation” &amp; for all your most kind aid in regard to the American Edit.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But I have been of late overwhelmed with letters, which I was forced to answer &amp; so put off writing to you.— This morning I received the American Edit (which looks capital), with your nice Preface for which hearty thanks. I hope to Heaven that the Book will succeed well enough to prevent you repenting of your aid. This arrival has put the finishing stroke to my conscience, which will endure its wrongs no longer.— I received, also, this morning a very pleasant &amp; friendly letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thurber to whom I will write in a few days.— He has sent me a bundle of the Agricult. newspaper, which seems to contain an astounding miscellany of facts &amp; notions.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Your article in the Nation seems to me very good &amp; you give an excellent idea of Pangenesis,—an infant cherished by few as yet, except his tender parent, but which will live a long life. There is parental presumption for you!<ref target="#foot.f4"/> You give a good slap at my concluding metaphor: undoubtedly I ought to have brought in &amp; contrasted natural &amp; artificial selection; but it seemed so obvious to me that nat. selection depended on contingencies even more complex than those which must have determined the shape of each fragment at the base of my precipice.— What I wanted to show was that in reference to preordainment whatever holds good in the formation of a pouter pigeon holds good in the formation of a natural species of Pigeon. I cannot see that this is false. If the right variations occurred &amp; no others natural selection w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be superfluous.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>A Reviewer in an Edinburgh paper, who treats me with profound contempt, says on this subject that Prof. Asa Gray could with the greatest ease smash me into little pieces.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>

Gray had quoted the passage, adding: <quote type="quote"> in Mr. Darwin’s parallel, to meet the case in nature according to his own view of it, not only the fragments of rock (answering to variation) should fall, but the edifice (answering to natural selection) should rise, irrespective of will and choice! </quote> CD had gone on (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 2: 432) to question Gray’s belief that variation had been ‘led along certain beneficial lines’, on the grounds that if a Creator had preordained each variation, then the ‘plasticity of organistion’, which led to many injurious variations, and the excessive power of reproduction, which led to a struggle for existence, would be ‘superfluous laws of nature’. Gray had commented in his review: ‘not superfluous, surely, if “survival of the fittest,” “excellent co-ordination,” and all the harmonious adaptation and diversity we behold are to result from the operation of those very laws’. (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3045.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[A. Gray] 1868</ref>, p. 236.) CD scored this passage in his copy of the review (see n. 2, above).</note>
