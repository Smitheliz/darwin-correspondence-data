<p>Facts regarding Lions in Central India<ref target="#foot.f2"/> and Wild Cattle in Southern India | Chas Crump. | Artillery<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Wild Cattle in the South.</p>
<p>There is as I have always heard a breed of wild cattle of a dull brick red colour in the Tinneyvelly District, who it is the tradition of the country sprang originally from the tame village cows who were driven off to the jungles by the people of the country when Tippo Sahib invaded the Raja of Travancore about the year 1788—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> So much I know only by hearsay— the following is of my own knowledge— On my way down from the Hills (Neilgheeries) in 47—I stayed with our 49<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at Vellore, there, one of the Officers (Oliver Butler I think)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> told me of a strange herd of wild cattle to be met with on the great plains about Rajas Choultry on the road to Madras and shewed me the skin and horns of one a bull which he had himself killed there a month or so before— this skin was dull brick red colour the horns same shape and as far as I remember rather thicker than common bullocks horns—</p>
<p>I halted a day at Rajas Choultry and went out after this herd but could not find them, however they were perfectly well known to all the people thereabouts and the account I received was as follows—</p>
<p>About 4 years before that time a wild bull of a red colour had appeared on the great plains which stretch from Rajas Choultry to Arcot, (and the people all said he came from the jungles <hi rend="underline">below</hi> Trichinopoly)— this bull fed by himself <anchor xml:id="ann.a1" type="annotationStart"/>but at times consorted with the tame herds fought and drove away the tame bulls and then walked into the cows;<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> from this intercourse in process of time <anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>sprung calves—two at first, red like their father—who when they had done sucking forsook the tame beasts<anchor xml:id="ann.a4" type="annotationEnd"/> and lived apart with their sire, and so the herd went on <hi rend="underline">he</hi> bulling the Village cows, and the calves forsaking the tame herds for the wild one till the wild cattle were 7 in number. viz—the original old bull the young bull Butler shot, and 5 cows.— this young bull was driven out of the herd by his Father for taking improper liberties with the cows took up his position close to a village where he molested cows, men, and everybody the Potail<ref target="#foot.f6"/> of the place came to the travellers Bungalow informed B of the fact and requested him to bring his gun and rid the village of the nuisance, young bull was under a tree, wouldnt budge but when B drew near, charged and was so shot.—</p>
<p>I heard afterwards that the whole race was exterminated by Kennedy of our 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> L. C. when he was stationed at Arcot—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I have heard from Jerden of another breed of wild cattle living in the salt water lagoons and islands above Nellore, he has been at the killing of some, and describes them as being of a dirty grey white with dark points.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
