                    <p>I hope that you will forgive me for begging a favour of you. I intend writing a preliminary notice to a short life of my grandfather D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eras: Darwin published in germany, &amp; I want to say something about him as a doctor.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> My father thought that he had influenced to a certain extent the practice of medicine in England, but he was of course a partial judge.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Can you give me any information on this head, for I know that you have attended specially to the subject. I have some curious evidence of eminent contemporary doctors thinking highly of him; but this does not go for much. The Zoonomia it is certain was formerly much studied.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> My father thought that his father’s advice not to mechanically restrain the insane, except when quite necessary, had a beneficial influence on their treatment.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Again that he was the first who advised the use of stimulants in fever if they lowered the pulse.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> If you can aid me in any way on this subject I shall be very grateful, but it is probable that you have not paid any attention to the Zoonomia.</p> 
                    <p>Any how I trust that you will forgive me for troubling you, &amp; I remain | my dear Sir | Yours faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">By the later eighteenth century, madness was increasingly regarded as an illness rather than as demonic possession, and some medical men and asylum keepers began to advocate techniques that minimised physical coercion, arguing that this produced outward conformity but not the internalisation of moral standards (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10773.xml">Scull 2011</ref>, p. 44). Erasmus Darwin supported this view in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1791.xml">E. Darwin 1794–6</ref>, 2: 352.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Erasmus Darwin argued that the lowering of the pulse in a fever patient by the administration of wine or beer was an indication that the correct dose of stimulant had been ascertained (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1791.xml">E. Darwin 1794–6</ref>, 1: 99). In advocating the use of stimulants Erasmus was following <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8576.xml">John Brown (bap. 1735 d. 1788)</ref>, whose methods required close monitoring of pulse, temperature, and general condition during the critical phases of illness (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10774.xml">Reinarz and Wynter 2014</ref>, p. 130). In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2365.xml"><hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi></ref>, p. 107, CD acknowledged that Erasmus was not the first to advocate such treatment.</note>
