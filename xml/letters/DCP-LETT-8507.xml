<p>Indolence, especially in making practicable future plans, being one of my besetting sins, (my speculative energies being expended for the most part in other directions,) I came abroad with hardly any scheme of travel at all. This is one of the chief causes of my long stay in London, (much longer than I thought it would be,) though not the best excuse that could be given for it. But I have from time to time taken advantage of other peoples’ plans and resolutions and followed the suggestions and guidance of friends, like a moral parasite. I〈n〉 accordance with this passive mode of 〈mo〉tion I made an appointment with a f〈riend,〉 who left London for Paris yesterday morning, to meet him there near the end of this week.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The engagement is not absolutely binding and was made mainly for my own benefit; but on the whole I think it best not to break it; although it would add much to the pleasure of my visit to you to meet your son again. I called at his rooms in Arlington St about a month ago and learned that he was gone on a journey.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I shall be much better pleased with the little visit you suggest than by a mere call, especially as it better suits your convenience; and I will come on Wednesday P.M. by the train you suggest from Charing 〈C〉ross 5<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. 5<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
