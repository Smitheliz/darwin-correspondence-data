                    <p>I am very much obliged for your letter, which I have considered attentively.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> In my opinion it would be best for you not to write to the Athenæum, because M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Butler is quite unscrupulous &amp; he would in answer pick out some passages in your essay &amp; say that they were borrowed from his book.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You could only deny this, &amp; no one would take the trouble to compare the two. Everybody will see in what a bad temper Butler has written &amp; will disregard his charges against you. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dallas means to take no notice of him.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Nevertheless if you decide to publish your letter I will get it translated; but in this case will you be so good as to strike out the passage about the first proof-sheets, for which reason I return your letter.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Having utterly forgotten these proofs I wrote to Butler that it had <hi rend="underline">never</hi> occurred to me to insert anything on the subject; &amp; after reading the above passage in your letter he would not hesitate to say that I had intentionally told a falsehood<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>I am sorry that you should have had the trouble of returning the Athenæum.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It has surprised me much, seeing what the reviews have said about our book, &amp; knowing that many strangers have greatly liked it, that the sale has not been greater, for the 1,000 copies have not yet all been disposed of. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray makes up his annual accounts in the middle of the summer, but I fear that there will be then but a small profit to transmit to you.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> It is good news that the German edit will soon be out.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In his letter to CD of 6 February 1880, Krause had enclosed a draft letter to the <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi>, responding to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_774.xml">Samuel Butler</ref>’s letter to the <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi> (for Butler’s letter, see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12445.xml">letter to H.

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">See n. 2, above. In the first proof-sheets of <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>, CD had included a passage mentioning that Krause added largely to his essay; he deleted it at Krause’s request, because the sentence also mentioned that much of Krause’s essay was later omitted since it duplicated material in CD’s section of the book (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12445.xml">letter to H. E. Litchfield, 1 February [1880]</ref>, enclosure 2).</note>
