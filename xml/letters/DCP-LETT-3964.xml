<p>I am not well today and leave home tomorrow for a week or ten days to try and get some rest;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> so I must write briefly; and thank you for your very kind letter briefly.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have really not knowledge sufficient about Columbia to make any suggestions.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> If the Latitude had been given, I should have strongly urged (but this will have occurred to you) to have collected seeds from individual trees growing at great heights. I allude, of course to Hooker’s observation that seeds collected at different heights of some species produced seedlings with different <hi rend="underline">constitution</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Thwaites of Botanical gardens of Ceylon tells me that this is the case in that island.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> It might <hi rend="underline">even</hi> be worth attending to in your present expedition as a point of science; i.e. to compare character of seedlings from great height and <hi rend="underline">low places</hi>.— Many thanks for corrections about the Menziesia, and about the hybrid sent to Hooker.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Here is odd chance! I have made two or three trials to see whether seeds from <hi rend="underline">short anthers</hi> germinated at different rates, as yet with no result; and I have tried ozonised water, with no result.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> <hi rend="underline">Not</hi> that I have tried nearly enough to come to any conclusion <hi rend="underline">worth</hi> anything. Pray forgive brevity, and, with cordial thanks.</p>
<p>Believe me, | Yours Sincerely. | C. Darwin.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. <hi rend="underline">Neumann</hi> I believe to be the man who has worked at fertilization of stove orchids and in good gardens.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I suspect he is working under M. Naudin (who is Decaisne right hand man and capital Botanist)<ref target="#foot.f11"/> M. Naudin writes to me, that he is going to publish on Hybridity and he believes he has discovered the physiological cause of sterility of Hybrids!!!<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I doubt.</p>
<p>If by any chance you have raised seedlings from any <hi rend="underline">“weeping” tree</hi>, I should be grateful for information to quote on degrees of inheritance of “weeping” quality.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Pray forgive this wretchedly untidy note; but I am good for nothing.</p>

The copyist included the year in the date line, although this was not CD’s usual practice. The year is confirmed by the relationship between this letter and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3958.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Isaac Anderson-Henry, 31 January 1863</ref>.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In his letter of 31 January 1863, Anderson-Henry informed CD that a collector (Robert Brown) had been sponsored by the British Columbia Botanical Association of Edinburgh to gather plants and seeds in Vancouver Island and British Columbia. Anderson-Henry asked CD whether he had any suggestions regarding what Brown ‘might look after’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker’s</ref> observations that altitude materially altered the habits of plants of the same species, and that seeds gathered at high altitudes produced hardier plants than seeds gathered at lower altitudes, were made in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3762.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D. Hooker 1852</ref>, pp. 69–71, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3763.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D. Hooker 1853</ref>, pp. xi–xii. There is a copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3763.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D. Hooker 1853</ref> in the Darwin Library–CUL.</note>

Thwaites communicated his observations on the acclimatisation of plants at different altitudes in a <ref target="" resp="#automat" cert="low">letter to CD of 28 December 1857</ref>, but the letter has not been found (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 7, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2211.xml" resp="#automat">letter to G. H. K. Thwaites, 7 February [1858]</ref>).

The hybrid sent to Hooker was probably sent in response to CD’s request for ‘any <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> sterile Hybrid plant with a rather large stigma’ (see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3929.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Isaac Anderson-Henry, 20 January [1863]</ref>). CD wanted to compare the stigmas of a hybrid plant with the stigmas of its parent-species by dissection (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3934.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 21 January [1863]</ref>). In a letter to Anderson-Henry, now missing, but written before 27 January 1863 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3948.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Isaac Anderson-Henry, 26–7 January 1863</ref>, n. 30), CD may have asked that the plant be sent to Hooker at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, where the parents of the hybrid could be located and where the dissection could be conducted conveniently. According to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242), CD visited the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, on 11 February 1863.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">In his letter to CD of 31 January 1863, Anderson-Henry remarked on his hypothesis that pollen from the short anthers of plants might have the property not only of producing dwarf offspring, but also of effecting ‘precocious fertility’ and differences in the hardiness of offspring. Anderson-Henry also suggested that increases in atmospheric ozone might promote the germination of seeds.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">In his letter of 31 January 1863, Anderson-Henry informed CD that he had been corresponding with <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3502.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Louis Neumann</ref>, a gardener at the Jardin des Plantes, the botanical department of the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris.
