<p>Your letter gladdened me as your hand writing always does, though the account of your state is anything but gladsome<ref target="#foot.f1"/>   Thank M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin very much for her part.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> This is just the place for my wife who gains ground rapidly, but loses it, or much of it, every now &amp; then &amp; is bloodless for a time. nevertheless, when weak,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Neuralgia does not attack her here, as at Kew, &amp; she walks several miles, &amp; eats like a Trojan.</p>
<p>This is a wonderfully pretty place, especially the banks of the river. the moors are loathsome &amp; the hills low broad rockless treeless &amp; contemptible.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am studying the moraines all day long with as much enthusiasm as I am capable of after laying in bed till 9 eating heavy breakfasts &amp; looking forward to dinner as the summum bonum of existence.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am reading Lubbock very carefully, it is excellent; most excellent, so well written sagacious &amp; discriminating.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> How well &amp; wisely he treats C. Lewis’ blunder &amp; hastyness &amp; the errors of others too.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The Savage chapters are tantalizing for their brevity &amp; incompleteness.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Why did you not mention Lyells apologetic pages in your letter—to me—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I suppose because the subject was most distressing— reason enough, for so it is— I am not satisfied with his apology at all— it is not handsome at all, &amp; from an old Prince of science to a young aspirant, is not liberal I think. I am not surprised at Lubbock having been <hi rend="underline">riled</hi> up originally: but cannot alter my opinion of the note,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> 1. that the accusation is too broad &amp; loose (exaggerated I fear), &amp; 2. the latter paragraph is a bitter sarcasm though wholly unintentionally so I quite believe— Do consider it. he first accuses Lyell of extracting <hi rend="underline">whole sentences</hi> without acknowlegdment &amp; then attributes the denial of the robbery to a <hi rend="underline">regretted inadvertence</hi>! i.e. Lyell first robs, then prearranges a fib to hide it, <hi rend="underline">before he</hi> <hi rend="underline">is accused</hi> mind you—&amp; lastly when accused regrets his wilful uncalled for fib, as an <hi rend="underline">inadvertence</hi>! by Jove if this is not a climax of villainy what is? all an ignorant bye-stander could say is, that his conscience is of a piece with his conduct. I am taking an ignorant byestanders view of the case— of course I know well that Lyells conduct has in justice no such interpretation.— I hope Lubbock will take no more notice of the affair, it is not worth it, &amp; never was. worth anything beyond a mere assurance that he was first, though apparently second in the field.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I know a little of Tylors brother— he is an FGS. &amp; FLS. that Edward Forbes’ big heart embraced. The family are gas fitters &amp;c &amp;c, hardware tradesmen most wealthy &amp; respectable, once quakers if not now quakers.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I never saw this author. I am so glad you like the book.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> it is to me the most interesting since your orchid work<ref target="#foot.f14"/> that I have read, &amp; like it I can always dip back with gusto, &amp; be refreshed.</p>
<p>I have read vol: 2 of Leckie (not vol 1 yet) &amp; am extremely interested &amp; instructed.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> The next holiday I get I must read Buckle,<ref target="#foot.f16"/> of which I have only read part of vol 2. I am also reading Tom Payne who I think has been pretty largely plundered by Grey &amp; Colenso.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>We have the Benthams here &amp; my cousin Inglis Palgrave.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> I have not begun Giffords book<ref target="#foot.f19"/> regularly, but dipped here &amp; there. it seems awfully conceited, vague &amp; meagre of accurate topographical or scientific information, &amp; very diffuse, but wonderfully clever as a literary composition. &amp; no doubt full of valuable historical matter— he is a queer fellow, eccentric like all his Grandfather’s grandchildren; with brains enough for us all if he would put them to work systematically.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>I had the most enjoyable dinner I ever sat down to out your home or perhaps Lubbocks at Frank Palgraves the other day, the guests being Jowett Maurice &amp; Gifford.— Browning &amp; Stanley came afterwards.<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>Can you afford to subscribe to the Palestine Exploration fund.<ref target="#foot.f22"/> I am deeply interested in the proper expenditure of the money &amp; with Spottiswood Grove &amp; some other good men I hope to see it well worked.<ref target="#foot.f23"/> I have given £3.3 (annually) for 3 years.</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer observations on umbellifer are utterly wrong—his reasoning partially right.<ref target="#foot.f24"/> How very odd, that the Antirrhinum case occurred to me as to you; I think <hi rend="underline">that</hi> part of his reasoning, all or in great part wrong.<ref target="#foot.f25"/> he makes too little of Insect agency in shaping flowers, &amp; of hereditary influence— too much of light air &amp; unconquerable love of symmetry in the plant— still there is much in the line of argument. He sends me the proof sheets to comment on.<ref target="#foot.f26"/> I have not seen them since— he did not know that you had taken up the modifying effects of insect agency in impregnation   as a general law, that is.<ref target="#foot.f27"/></p>
<p>I have not seen Nat Hist. Review which will not pay, is all but defunct I hear! &amp; cannot go on beyond the year.<ref target="#foot.f28"/></p>
<p>Oliver is working at African plants &amp; his lectures<ref target="#foot.f29"/></p>
<p>Ever yrs affec | J D Hooker</p>
<p>My Charlie has taken hooping cough at school, he returns on 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. which puts all our arrangements out as we must keep him apart, which is difficult during Willys holidays.<ref target="#foot.f30"/></p>
