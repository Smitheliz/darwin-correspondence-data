<p>I write this at the urgent request of a friend who assured me that you would feel interested to hear of my little experience with earthworms.—</p>
<p>I have a garden at the back of my house and in the centre of it there is a plot of 48 feet by 17—which, in spite of various attempts to grow grass on, I cannot succeed in making look nice &amp; green,—as I see the grass in my neighbours’ gardens.</p>
<p>For some time I observed an unusual quantity of those little curly mountlets which earthworms throw up and, as the grass was getting scarcer and scarcer, I saw these earthworms in great numbers, covering the plot.—</p>
<p>A friend of mine told me that Perchloride of Mercury was the best remedy for this evil, as it destroyed the worms without injuring the grass.—</p>
<p>It was towards the beginning of October that I commenced operating on my lawn and I went about it as follows.</p>
<p>I dissolved 4 Ounces of Perchloride of Mercury in a Quart of boiling water and mixed it with 20 to 30 Gallons of cold water.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I then watered the lawn and the effect was simply amazing</p>
<p>No sooner had I thrown the water on when,—before even the watering can was emptied,—the worms appeared.— They were crawling out by the hundreds and from their wriggling &amp; turning about I must conclude that they were in great agony.</p>
<p>I gave the plot of ground a watering from time to time during three weeks or so and, from a computation I made, I must have picked up something like 8000 worms—which is about 10 worms per square foot.—</p>
<p>My friend was right when he said I would kill the worms but he was wrong when he told me I would not injure the grass.— I have no grass to speak of now, but I mean to sow it in spring,— with what result remains to be seen.—</p>
<p>I have since heard that You published an article in the Times some months ago in which You demonstrated that worms are an important factor in the economy of nature and I must confess I feel half sorry I destroyed them in my garden,—but as my lawn was not getting on at all <hi rend="underline">with</hi> them, I thought I should give it a trial <hi rend="underline">without</hi> them.</p>
<p>May I ask You Sir to let me know the number of the Times in which Your article appeared as I should very much like to read it.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Excuse my liberty in addressing You at such a length on a subject which possibly may not be interesting enough to You, but which certainly to me and my friends was very curious.</p>
<p>I remain | Sir | Your’s very respectf<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> | N. Krohn</p>
