<p>Your letter arrived appropriately enough this morning<ref target="#foot.f1"/> as Darwin &amp; I were engaged last evening in a consultation over the affairs of the Station—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Neither he nor I think that there is much to be done among our rich men—but there is a strong feeling among scientific people who understand the value of the station &amp; know the sacrifices which you have made to establish it to be of such use to you as they can.</p>
<p>The only feasible means of raising money which occurs to us is to circulate among those persons who are likely to be interested &amp; helpful—and among those only the following Statement to be headed</p> 
<p rend="centre"><hi rend="underline">Private</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Confidential</hi></p> 
<p>We the undersigned have reason to believe that the following statement is correct   A well known Zoologist D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Anton Dohrn, is building a Zoological Station at Naples, not as a private speculation but for the good of science; and he has already expended (sum to be stated)</p>
<p>From the failure of his contractor he is now in a position of difficulty and there is reason to fear that the whole undertaking may fail unless he receives assistance</p>
<p>He wishes to borrow about £1000—but we think that it would be a better plan to present to him a sum of money, to be used exclusively in completing the station.</p>
<p>We are convinced after due deliberation that a Zoological Station at Naples founded and carried on in accordance with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dohrns plan, would be in many ways of the highest service to Natural Science and especially as a means of educating young naturalists in Zoological Research— Of those who have signed this paper some are unable, from various circumstances, to subscribe but are earnestly desirous to see the Station successful; others have not yet determined what they will subscribe. Any one who is inclined to give his assistance in any manner is requested to write to — — — — who will manage the affair &amp; be responsible for the transmission of the subscriptions<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>This would be signed by Darwin, M. Foster, Balfour   Dew Smith,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> myself &amp; others and we think it very probable we might be able to raise £400 or £500 in this way</p>
<p>I am not going to subscribe myself—having like you, been engaged in building—I have just at present no cash to spare<ref target="#foot.f5"/>— And this has been one reason for my hesitation about applying to other people  </p>
<p>The document as you see will be marked ‘<hi rend="underline">Private &amp; Confidential</hi>’ &amp; therefore can acquire no publicity—</p>
<p>But you have expressed so strong a feeling against a public subscription—that I told Darwin I thought we could not proceed in this manner without consulting you— And I write without delay to ask whether the step we propose to take will meet with your approval or not   Let me have your answer speedily—</p>
<p>I am very glad that the Philosophical Transactions have reached you safely<ref target="#foot.f6"/> and still more rejoiced to find that you can say “Apage, Sathanas!<ref target="#foot.f7"/> to the blue Devils.</p>
<p>Commend me to Mademoiselle<ref target="#foot.f8"/> &amp; believe me | Ever Yours | T. H. Huxley</p>
<p>I write in haste to save post</p>
