<p>As M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stirling has sent me the recp<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. you may as well have it with the Photo of the four Fuegian boys which he wishes me to send you in case you have not seen it. He expresses his great pleasure at your aiding us.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>The upper face is the lad from Packsaddle Bay, and he seems to show the most intelligence. The one below is Jemmy Button’s son   I thought I saw a distinct likeness to his Father and he had the most amiable face of them all. The one on their right hand, a nephew of Jemmy’s—and the one on the left, the little orphan boy without either Father or Mother who from the first showed a great attachment to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stirling &amp; asked him to be his Father<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I have sent your note about “Johnny Rooks” as they are called there to Stirling by the last mail<ref target="#foot.f4"/> As you are so interested in all relating to the Tame animals seen wild at Falklands. I think you may like to hear a fact about the horses if I have not told you it before. There were two wild stallions each with his small troop of mares in the hills over Port William—and it is quite certain that they never would have been near each other without fighting— The young English Horse I took out was running under those hills with eight mares, &amp; several times these wild horses had <hi rend="underline">singly</hi> tried to fight him for his mares—but he was more than a match for either of them. One day these two came in <hi rend="underline">together</hi> and attacked him.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> our Capitain saw it from the house and when he rode to the spot one horse was keeping our horse engaged while the other was driving away the mares and had got four of them away from the rest— The man settled it by driving the whole party into our Corral for the wild ones stuck to the mares: but when lassoing one of them they broke through the corral &amp; escaped.</p>
<p>Does it not seem as if they had some means of agreeing to be friends for the time &amp; to attack the strong stranger jointly— The worst part of it was that one carried off a new small lasso of mine round his neck &amp; was never seen again   most probably he was choaked by the end of the lasso catching in the stones among the hills.</p>
<p>with kind regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin | Believe me | Yours very sincerely | B J Sulivan</p>
