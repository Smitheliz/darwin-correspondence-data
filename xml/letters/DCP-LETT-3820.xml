<p>I have been rather slack in obeying my boy Leonard’s instructions to thank you most sincerely for a number of stamps with which your envelope of Oct. 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> was plaistered (the enclosures were duly posted) &amp; for a precious Canada stamp previously sent.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He believes he is by far the richest boy in the whole school in N. American stamps, &amp; expects to get wonderful treasures by trading with some sent by you in duplicate.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The Nesæa seeds came all safe, &amp; are as great a treasure to me as the stamps to Leonard, &amp; stronger I cannot put it.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I see you say you have sent 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> notice on Orchid Book to Silliman;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have not received the first, which I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think must be out, &amp; which I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. very much like to possess.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> By the way in the last Edinburgh R<hi rend="superscript">w</hi>. there is an article by Duke of Argyll on “Supernaturalism” in which Orchids are brought in:<ref target="#foot.f7"/> it is clever; but I do not see that it really removes any of the difficulties of Theology.—</p>
<p>In the last Macmillan there is a little Review on Max Muller,—on the origin of language; (by my Brother-in-law, H. Wedgwood &amp; his daughter) which I think is worth looking at.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> This letter is a sort of Literary Intelligencer; for I am going to tell you that Bates’ paper on Butterflies of Amazonia, in last part of Linn. Transactions. is well worth some labour in studying, though out of your special line.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> The mimetic cases are really wonderful, &amp; no one has brought so clearly before my mind the process of segregation of varieties into species. But I doubt whether you will have time to go into paper carefully enough to appreciate it. Lyell’s book, which I am very curious to see is not yet out; but Murray sold 4000! copies the other day at his auction.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I have nearly finished a long chapter on the simple facts of the variation of a few of our cultivated plants,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very much obliged for an answer to one question. Is the fruit of the wild Fragaria Virginiana much larger, (twice or thrice?) than that of F. vesca?<ref target="#foot.f12"/> and secondly do you know anything of the F. grandiflorus, said to have come from Surinam, &amp; often called the Carolina strawberry. How far south does F. virginiana range?</p>
<p>Do you remember about my Boy, Horace, on the natural selection of coward adders?<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I must tell you that the other day he overheard me talking about species; &amp; afterwards he came to me, with his eyes open with astonishment &amp; asked “Did people <hi rend="underline">formerly</hi> really believe that animals &amp; plants never changed? I answered oh yes. “Well then what did they say about the kinds of cabbages &amp; peas in the Garden?” I answered that these were all due to man’s agency. “But do not wild plants vary”. I answered that they varied within certain fixed but unknown limits. To this he shrugged his shoulders with pity for the poor people who <hi rend="underline">formerly</hi> believed in such conclusions.— I believe Horace is a prophetic type, as Agassiz would say, of future naturalists.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>I see in Times today the great news of Macclellan’ds dismissal from your army—.— Good God what will be the end of all?—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>Ever my dear Gray | Yours most truly</p>
