<p>I write chiefly to say that I called at the Lyell’s last Saturday, but that Sir. Chas. was too unwell to see me— I had a talk with Miss L. who told me that he had been poorly for some days, weaker &amp; that his mind was confused, so that he could not even have Miss Buckley with him for long.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am awfully sorry to hear of the fate of the Drosophyllum, &amp; wish I had let it go straight to you from Edinburgh— Smith told me that on its arrival here he did not unpack it, but as a precaution he added another wrap to it.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have not seen Mivart, except at the R. S. twice— he left both times before the meeting was over   I wish he was at Jehanum<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>The Huxleys spent Monday eveng with us— he looks worn again &amp; lacking in energy— I am sure that he is not taking care enough of himself:<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Of course I must not turn up my nose at the <hi rend="underline">Glaucium</hi> story, nor at anything that DeCandolle believes as to new varieties of Glaucium, (of which no two specimens are alike)—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>We are all much the same: Harriet is quite poorly, &amp; I hope to send her abroad next month— I shall not get to Algeria except I get a secretary—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Lord Henry has not put the necessary sum in the Estimates—has in fact burked my application without saying a word to me about it— I must wait to see what the Govt. intend to do with that contemptible idiot. The row in the Office between him &amp; the Treasury is disgraceful.— He has cut his 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Secretary <hi rend="underline">dead</hi>. they have no personal communication—&amp; the official business is conducted through the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Secretary, who is forbidden to mention the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Seys name in his presence!— His brother the D. of Richmond is a very different cut of man. &amp; declines I hear to support him.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Ayrton enjoys it all &amp; laughs in his sleeve—at the mischief he has made.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The whole thing is contemptible.</p>
