                    <salute>My Dear Darwin</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I am very glad to hear from you, and to see half your letter of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Oct. in your own handwriting is a good sign.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I do hope you may get a comfortable winter, and bring out your next volume without breaking down.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am pleased that you approve my abstract of your Climber paper.—but <hi rend="underline">observe </hi>it was only of the <hi rend="underline">1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> part</hi> of your elaborate article—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But as to <hi rend="underline">praise</hi> you speak of, I am sure you pay me back, with interest.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I lately sent to Silliman as much more—a large part, indeed, <hi rend="underline">extracts</hi>, which I could not shorten—on the tendril-bearing part of your paper. But Dana sent me the proof, with all my long extracts omitted for want of room.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> This reduced my article to incoherence, so I begged all to be laid over for the January number, when I hope to have room. I entertained our Social Scientific Club here with your article, and all were greatly interested.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> As to Climbing Roses, they are the strong <hi rend="underline">summer</hi> shoots, growing after flowering, which I find frequently running their heads into dark corners of the porch over my door, &amp;c—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>That is very curious—but quite what I looked for—that dimorphous species self-fertilized, should act <hi rend="underline">like</hi> <hi rend="underline">hybrids</hi> (sterile or dwarfs, &amp;c—)</p>
<p>You <hi rend="underline">must</hi> publish these facts in some brief article—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>“Stephens” ==== Stevens, was a New Yorker—is dead, years ago.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> wrote most amusing &amp; popular travels—in Egypt, as well— Central America was his first &amp; freshest book.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> But only <hi rend="underline">amusing</hi>, as far as I recollect.</p>
<p>So Palmerston is gone—a fine specimen of a John Bull he was—a very typical specimen. The Yankees can’t help admirng &amp; liking him.—tho’ not for any good he ever did us.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> But as for his successor, he is a prig,—a juiceless stick.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Don’t you think Adams pays him back nicely for propo〈sing〉 that they should sit down and rejoice together over the abolition of slavery.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Just to see how the world has moved, turn back to Russell’s letter/lecture to be read to Mr. Lincoln, on occasion of his proclamation of emancipation!<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Good Bye, my dear good fellow, and recover health as fast as ever you can.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately | A. Gray</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f13">In his capacity as United States minister to Great Britain, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_28.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Francis Adams</ref>, was involved in negotiations with the British government to obtain compensation for commercial losses inflicted by Confederate vessels that had been built or given shelter in British ports during the American Civil War. On 26 October 1865, the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> printed the diplomatic correspondence between Adams and Russell concerning the US claims. In his letter of 30 August 1865, Russell maintained that the British government had acted honourably as a neutral power, and could not be held responsible for damages caused by the southern vessels; he concluded by congratulating the US government for having resolved to abolish slavery, a practice for which the British had always held ‘the deepest abhorrence’: ‘The efforts by which the United States Government and Congress have shaken off slavery have, therefore, the warmest sympathies of the people of these kingdoms’. In his reply, Adams reiterated the US claims and remarked that it had been his misfortune ‘to observe in the process of so wonderful a revolution, a degree of coldness and apathy prevailing in many quarters’ of the British public; he hoped, however, that ‘the result arrived at [would] ultimately correct the hasty and harsh judgments that flowed from lack of faith and of confidence in [the US government’s] fidelity to a righteous cause’. The correspondence between Adams and Russell also appeared in the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> (supplement), 11 October 1865, pp. 4833–60.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f14">The ‘letter’ or ‘lecture’ has not been identified; however, Russell issued several statements following the decree made by the US president, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2927.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Abraham Lincoln</ref>, on 22 September 1862, which gave freedom, effective from 1 January 1863, to slaves in the states that were currently at war with the Union. In a memorandum published by the Foreign Office and circulated to Cabinet ministers on 13 October 1862, Russell criticised the decree for ‘want of consistency’, and described it as ‘an act of punishment and retaliation inflicted by a belligerent upon a hostile community’, rather than an attempt to satisfy the ‘claims of humanity’ (see Bourne and Watt eds. 1986–7, 6: 94–5). See also Earl Russell to Earl Cowley, ‘Despatch respecting the Civil War in North America’, <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Papers</hi>, 72 (1863): 3–4, and Earl Russell to Lord Lyons, 17 January 1863, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 51–2. Russell’s response to the ‘emancipation proclamation’ is discussed in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4177.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Jenkins 1974–80</ref>, 2: 174–5.</note>
