<p> –  </p>
<p>Susan has given me this third sheet to write to you upon; but why I should do so I know not. Apologies are come much too late for such shamefully ungrate- ful conduct as mine has been and excuses I have none. You are become like a stranger to me. I do not know from what point to begin with After you left Cambridge I got into very nice rooms in College, far more comfortable than lodgings,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> as you will find when you come next to Cambridge. I imbibed your tastes<ref target="#foot.f3"/> about prints, and put it into practice, and have bought some very good prints, which I long for you to see. I came down from Cambridge yesterday which I left very empty. I think I shall go and see old Edinburg this X’tmas, before all my friends entirely leave it. I left Fox up in Cam. in great awe and tribulation about his degree, which is to be made very much more strict, so that they give out that at least 50 will be plucked:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I live almost entirely with Fox and Entomology goes on most surprisingly. Price is in Cambridge and has got some pupils, he intends writing to you very soon. Kennedy<ref target="#foot.f5"/> is a tutor at St. Johns: Whitley will be either first or second next year: I see a good deal of him and like him very much. This will be but a poor finishing to Susan’s letter, and must be awfully stupid. When is there any prospect of your coming back again? I long very much to see the Bachelor of Medicine again.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Fanny Owen is as charming as ever and deserves your string of German epithets more than ever.</p>
<p>My dear old Erasmus | Yours most affectionately | C. Darwin</p>
