<p>Again I am going to trouble you. I suspect, if I keep on at this rate, you will sincerely wish me at Terra de Fuego or any other Terra, but England.— First I will give my commissions.— Tell Nancy to make me soon 12 instead of 8 shirts: Tell Edward to send me up in my carpet bag, (he can slip the key in the bag tied to some string) my slippers, a pair of lightish walking shoes.—My Spanish books: my new microscope (about 6 inches long &amp; 3 or 4 deep),<ref target="#foot.f1"/> which must have cotton stuffed inside: my geological compass.—my Father knows that: A little book, if I have got it in bedroom, Taxidermy:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> ask my Father if he thinks there would be any objection to my taking Arsenic for a little time, as my hands are not quite well—&amp; I have always observed, that if I once get them well &amp; change my manner of living about same time they will generally remain well.— What is the dose?— Tell Edward my gun is dirty: What is Erasmus direction, tell me if you think there is time to write &amp; to receive an answer before I start: as I should like particularly to know what he thinks about it. I suppose you do not know Sir J. Macintosh direction?—</p>
<p>I write all this as if it was settled but it is not more than it was.—excepting that from Cap. FitzRoy wishing me so much to go, &amp; from his kindness I feel a predestination I shall start.— I spent a very pleasant evening with him yesterday: he must be more than 23 old. he is of a slight figure, &amp; a dark but handsome edition of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Kynaston.—&amp; according to my notions preeminently good manners: He is all for Economy excepting on one point, viz fire arms he recommends me strongly to get a case of pistols like his which cost 60£!!, &amp; never to go on shore anywhere without loaded ones.— &amp; he is doubting about a rifle.— he says I cannot appreciate the luxury of fresh meat here.— Of course I shall buy nothing till every thing is settled: but I work all day long at my lists, putting in &amp; striking out articles.— This is the first really cheerful day I have spent since I received the letter, &amp; it all is owing to the sort of involuntary confidence I place in my beau ideal of a Captain.—</p>
<p>We stop at Teneriffe. His object is to stop at as many places as possible. he takes out 20 Chronometers &amp; it will be a “sin” not to settle the longitudes:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> he tells me to get it down on writing at y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Admiralty that I have the free choice to leave, as soon &amp; wherever I like:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I daresay you expect I shall turn back at the Madeira: if I have a morsel of stomach left, I wont give up.— Excuse my so often troubling &amp; writing, the one is of great utility, the other a great amusement to me.— Most likely I shall write tomorrow</p>
<p>Love to my Father.— Dearest Susan | C. Darwin</p>

The dimensions are close to those of the box of the Cary microscope at Down House (6.2 inches by 2.8 inches), which suggests that CD may have taken that instrument with him on the voyage. But, if so, it was not his only one. Another, also at Down House, bearing the name ‘Bancks &amp; Son, 119 New Bond Street’, is, in the opinion of Professor Phillip Sloan, based on measurements of the focal lengths, the main one utilised by CD on board the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> (Phillip Sloan, personal communication). There is further evidence in the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-207.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to W. D. Fox, 23 May 1833</ref> that CD had the Bancks microscope on board.
