            <p>Acknowledges receipt of two letters from CD and a box of specimens.</p>
            <p>Mentions attendance at BAAS meeting and a gift to him of a small living near Oxford. Some political news.</p>
            <p>Congratulates CD on the work he has done – the specimens are of great interest. Gives advice on packing, labelling, and future collecting and suggests that – as a precaution – CD send home a copy of his notes on the specimens.</p>

<p>I shall begin a letter to you lest something or other should persuade me to defer it till it
                            becomes too late for the next packet— Wood &amp; I had intended writing
                            by the Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. packet, but just as was
                            about to do so your letter arrived stating that a Box was on its road,
                            so I thought I had better delay till I had seen its contents. It is now
                            here &amp; every thing has travelled well. I shall however proceed by
                            rule &amp; answer your two letters first &amp; then come to the Box.
                                The 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> date of your first letter
                            is May 18. &amp; this I received at Cambridge in June, no, it was
                            sent me from Cambridge in July, to Weymouth where I was spending the
                            summer with my family and two pupils in exploring the geology &amp;c
                            &amp;c of that neighbourhood, &amp; a capable ramble we had. I stopped
                            at Oxford in my way there, where the British Association had assembled
                            for a weeks scientific discussion &amp; a delightful time it was. Next
                            summer this society is to meet in Cambridge. When at Oxford I received a
                            letter from the L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Chancellor giving me a
                            small living in Berksh: about 14 miles from Oxford. Of course I do
                            not reside, as I never mean to quit Cambridge without something very
                            extraordinary should happen.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I never mean to
                            leave it for lucres sake. We returned to Cambridge in Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. &amp; have had the bustle of the Election
                            to go thru’. We could make nothing of any attempt to squeeze a Whig in
                            for the University so gave it up.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> We have got
                            2 Whigs for the town and 2 Whigs &amp; one Tory for the
                            County— But the papers will tell you all this— At this moment I am
                            examiner in Paley &amp; in one hour have to attend in the Senate house.
                            Now for a revision of your letters— I would not bother myself about
                            whether I were right or wrong in noting such &amp; such facts about
                            Geology— note all that <hi rend="underline">may</hi>

                            little sketch thus. N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>.1. (specimen (a))

                            &amp;c</p>
<p>When Sedgwick returns we will look over your specimens &amp; I will send you our joint
                                report—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> they seem quite <hi rend="underline">large</hi> enough!— I myself caught an Octopus at Weymouth this
                            summer &amp; observed the change of color whenever I opened the tin box
                            in which I put it, but not in such great perfection as you seem to have
                            done— The fact is not new, but any fresh observations will be highly
                            important— Quere if a <hi rend="underline">serpentine rock</hi> be not
                            the produce of volcanic baking of a chloritic slate? The rock of S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Paul <hi rend="underline">may</hi> not be
                            an exception to the usual character of the Isl<hi rend="superscript">ds</hi>. of the Atlantic.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have got
                            the description of the plates to the Dict. Classique &amp; will send it
                            where you direct. Your account of the Tropical forest is delightful, I
                            can’t help envying you— So far from being disappointed with the Box—I
                            think you have done wonders—as I know you do not confine yourself to
                            collecting, but are careful to describe— Most of the plants are very
                            desirable to <hi rend="underline">me</hi>. Avoid sending <hi rend="underline">scraps</hi>. Make the specimens as perfect as you
                            can, <hi rend="underline">root</hi>, <hi rend="underline">flowers</hi>
                            &amp; <hi rend="underline">leaves</hi> &amp; you can’t do wrong. In
                            large ferns &amp; leaves fold them back upon themselves on <hi rend="underline">one</hi> side of the specimen &amp; they will get
                            into a proper sized paper. <hi rend="underline">Don’t</hi> trouble
                            yourself to stitch them—for the really travel better without it— and a
                            single label <hi rend="underline">per month</hi> to 
                            <table rend="width35">
                                <row>

                            </table>those of the same place is enough except you have plenty of
                            spare time or spare hands to write more. L. Jenyns does not know
                            what to make of your land Planariæ. Do you mistake for such the curious
                            Genus, “Oncidium” allied to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> slug, of
                            which a fig. is given in Lin. Transact.<ref target="#foot.f6"/>

                            interesting. If you could get hold of Cuvier’s Anatomie des

                            Watkins has received your letter— And now for the Box— Lowe <hi rend="underline">underpacks</hi> Darwin <hi rend="underline">overpacks</hi> — The latter is in fault on the right side. You need
                            not make quite so great a parade of tow &amp; paper for the geolog<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>. specimens, as they travel very well
                            provided they be each wrapped up <hi rend="underline">German</hi>
                            <hi rend="underline">fashion</hi> &amp; closely stowed—but <hi rend="underline">above all things</hi> don’t put tow round <hi rend="underline">any thing</hi> before you have first wrapped it up
                            in a piece of thin paper— It is impossible to clear away the fibres of
                            the tow from some of your specimens without injuring them— An excellent
