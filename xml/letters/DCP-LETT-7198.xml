            <p>Willy is back from New Zealand. JDH perturbed by what to do with him.</p> 
<p>J. W. Dawson’s Bakerian lecture for Royal Society is full of errors, and JDH is forced to recommend that it not be published. [An abstract of the lecture was published: "On the pre-Carboniferous floras of north-eastern America", <hi rend="italic">Proc. R. Soc. Lond.</hi> 18 (1869–70): 333–5.]</p>

<p>because it is so long since I have written to you that, if alive, you must now be really <hi rend="underline">very</hi> old.— I have such lots to write to you about myself, that I put off &amp; off the boring you over &amp; over again. Then too I have been worked to death with that British Flora, &amp; all manner of things. &amp; now Willy is back from New Zealand &amp; that costs time &amp; thought—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> as this last is the best news I shall begin with it— the lad is “fat &amp; well-liking” &amp; apparently not in the least hurt by his rough life &amp; voyagering— he is as nice &amp; simple as ever; &amp; beyond that a very few Colonial phrases have replaced many school ones, &amp; his voice is breaking, he is quite unchanged in mind &amp; manners. I quite expected that some roughness at least would have resulted from contact with rough people, but I do not find a trace of it— Hector certainly managed splendidly for him, I am under a very great obligation to him.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Mentally I find little development, but he has ability &amp; if I could only get him to take the smallest interest in any one subject, I should not despair. I have not settled what to do with him: he enjoyed his life, &amp; talks most nicely of all the people he was thrown into company with,—but has no wish to go abroad again.</p>
<p>Have I told you of the jolly tour I took with Huxley to the Eifel, with my boy Charlie, to whom H. has taken a great fancy— we dabbled a little in the Geology, which is most curious, took long walks, ate very heartily &amp; came back quite as well as we went.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am now in a frightful state of mind. The R.S. have referred to me Dawsons Bakerian lecture &amp; I find it so full of <hi rend="underline">perfect</hi> trash that I am compelled to recommend it’s <hi rend="underline">non</hi> publication, it will be a knock-down blow to the poor man— The systematic part is very meagre indeed, the vegetable anatomy miserable &amp; often utterly wrong; the affinities more often mere guess work, than not; &amp; as to the theories &amp; speculations, they would make your hair stand on end.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>What do you say to the Appalachian chain being “the centre of Plant-distribution from the Carboniferous era onwards” and the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">N.E.</hi> corner of that chain being “the point of origin of the Palæozoic Flora”.— Dawson’s discovery of many fossil plants of the Carboniferous type, low down in the Devonian, is a very excellent one, &amp; if he had but contented himself with the proper summation of that, &amp; accompanied it with sufficient evidence his paper would have been a valuable one but he has overloaded the systematic portion with generic &amp; specific names from the merest scraps of tissue, &amp; utterly misunderstood the structure of the most complete specimens. Then too he has page after page of the wildest speculations upon <hi rend="underline">Archaic</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">synthetic</hi> types, on <hi rend="underline">origination of species</hi> by “embryonic retardation &amp; advance”, on “conditions of compression &amp; expansion”, upon “advanced &amp; postponed maturity”— &amp; on “tendency of synthetic types to become specialized in the direction of their constituents elements” upon “types comparable to a chemists allotropic forms” &amp; so forth. The blessed lecture cost me 2<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> days hard work, &amp; I am excessively sorry for the poor man, whose reception was enthusiastic by Lyell &amp; Murchison,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; whose fall will be proportionally heavy &amp; headlong. He has brought the paper all the way from Canada &amp; was <hi rend="underline">invited</hi> to make the Bakerian Lecture of it! Altogether the affair has cut me up terribly, &amp; I would rather have burnt my fingers than performed so hateful a duty.— It is a very small consolation, that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D. has a wonderfully good opinion of—<hi rend="underline">himself</hi>. He &amp; his wife spent half a day here;— she must have been very pretty, &amp; that, to me, makes matters worse— &amp; worse still, their son is deformed &amp; I know that he too will feel hurt—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The curse of Cain will cleave to me.— By the way he pooh-poohed my Greenland paper,—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> this has only just come into my head, &amp; does not mend matters— for he will if he hears of it, put my sinister report down to spite, whereas I would fain have heaped coals of fire on the poor devils head by a gushing (not crushing) report—</p>
<p>We have had Cinthea Symonds<ref target="#foot.f9"/> here for a fortnight &amp; I still find her very charming— My Uncle John Gunn has just returned from the Mediterranean, he had collected largely fossils at Marathon &amp; Electra in Greece, but they were all <hi rend="underline">stolen</hi> off his caleche<ref target="#foot.f10"/> at Naples!— what a sell for the theives—</p>
<p>Charlie has come out top of his form at Marlborough,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> &amp; is promoted— I cannot tell you how happy this has made me.</p>
<p>I am at a monograph of <hi rend="underline">Nepenthes</hi> for DC. Prod. &amp; then shall go to long suspended Gen. Plant.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Do write me a line &amp; tell me what you are doing &amp; how you all fare.</p>
