<p>I am very much indebted to you for having taken so much trouble on my account, who have no manner of claim upon your courtesy.</p>
<p>I have received the “Content” slips of your forthcoming work which I, among so many more, shall look for with pleasant anticipation.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>With regard to the few observations I have made on <hi rend="underline">some</hi> methods of intercommunication between animals, your suggestion that I should draw up a short paper on the subject is no doubt the best, and when I have a few days to spare I shall do my best to put my notes in order. Whatever I have to say will go further to strengthen the belief that animals <hi rend="underline">do</hi> communicate (and that not merely simple ideas) than to explain the precise <hi rend="underline">means</hi> of transmitting their mental impressions. I suppose there is no animal whatever possessed of a high organization which has not the power of communicating a simple mental impression such as alarm: but I think that something much more complex can be traced among such phlegmatic creatures even as sheep; amounting to the capacity to arrange a line of action, and convey to other individuals a general idea of it. When they are flurried, sheep justify the proverb relating to their “follow my leader” habits: but in the broken country and forests of Australia where their natural faculties have full play, they may be seen to possess a vast amount of intelligence.</p>
<p>Should any-thing which I may be able to string together be accepted by one of the Magazines I shall do myself the honour of forwarding you a copy in case it may contain any thing of interest to you.</p>
<p>With renewed thanks I am, | Dear Sir; | Yours very truly | Arthur Nicols <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
