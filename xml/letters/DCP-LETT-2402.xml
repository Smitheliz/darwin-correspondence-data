<p>Your very kind letter, received yesterday, with its announcement has much surprised &amp; pleased me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It would be superfluous to say how highly I feel the honour which the Council has conferred on me.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am astonished at it, for I am well aware how little I have done for many years for geology, having been incapacitated for any bodily fatigue.— This has been a great misfortune to me, for I honour from the bottom of my soul the noble science &amp; its followers.— I will, of course, attend at the anniversary, if I possibly can, but my health is very uncertain &amp; I never know what I can do the next day. In simple truth I cannot attend the Dinner. I assure you that most unwillingly I have been absolutely compelled to give up dining out with my nearest neighbours &amp; friends, or receiving them at my own house. I could not sit out a public dinner. I am very sorry to appear ungracious, but this is the simple truth.—</p>
<p>Believe me that I am fully sensible of the very great honour, far more than I deserve, which the Council &amp; you have done me. And with my cordial thanks for the extremely kind manner, with which you have communicated the fact to me</p>
<p>Pray believe me | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. It is a shame to trouble you, but will you have the kindness to send me one line to say, whether I have to return thanks for the Medal at the anniversary; Strangely I cannot, for the life of me, remember.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
