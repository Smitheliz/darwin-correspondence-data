<p>I wish to thank Mrs. Darwin most heartily for her kind note of the 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. ult.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I feared you had been ill, and I think I had long ago some intimation to that effect, in some indirect way, but I hardly believed it, as just before I had received one of your usual bright letters.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Hooker not having written since the death of his daughter,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> and Boott having been very ill,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> all my sources of intelligence were cut off.</p>
<p>It is sad to hear that you are obliged to suspend all your work for half a year. Pray disappoint the physicians and get all right again sooner. For there is a deal for you to do. But after all, we must be patient. It is far more important that you get well surely than speedily. And pray, somehow, continue to let me know how you are getting on.</p>
<p>I have no scientific news for you. I have been busy at very humdrum botanical work. I read lately, with <hi rend="underline">gusto</hi>, Wallace’s <hi rend="underline">exposé</hi> of the Dublin man (Haughton) on Bee-cells, &amp;c—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>The next-best thing, of late, is the <hi rend="underline">exposé</hi> of Lindsay &amp; Geo. <hi rend="underline">Saunders</hi> (the Confederates) by <hi rend="underline">Historicus</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I trust Historicus’ previous letters, in which he shows—about the same time my father-in-law’s articles on the subject reached England<ref target="#foot.f7"/>—that it is the duty of a country to see that armed or war vessels are not fitted out, quite irrespective of all municipal law, have produced their proper effect.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Something has produced a great effect, and a great change in the idea of what it was incumbent on the government to do; and nothing can be more satisfactory than the views now taken:<ref target="#foot.f9"/> and the effect here is excellent. For we are sure that when the right notions once get a lodgement, as they have, England will faithfully carry them through.</p>
<p>Lawyers whom I know here were confident how the law would ultimately be laid down by your courts,<ref target="#foot.f10"/>—but we greatly feared it would be done only after a few more such vessels had got to sea. All will go well now.</p>
<p>The newspaper I occasionally send you is a fair specimen of the <hi rend="underline">influential</hi> part of the press here.</p>
<p>Such articles as the <hi rend="underline">Times</hi> likes to cite have far less effect here than you suppose in the determination of events.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>The result of the autumn elections will let you know<ref target="#foot.f12"/>—what has all along been clear to me—that the <hi rend="underline">North</hi> has no notion whatever of l〈e〉aving its work till it is done.</p>
<p>Thanks for the article in the Reader<ref target="#foot.f13"/>—true enough, no doubt, sensible &amp; dull.</p>
<p>The best thing I have read of late was the showing up of that consummate humbug (as for many years I have regarded him) Brougham, in the Spectator.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>The confidence that every month’s prolongation of the contest makes the destruction of slavery surer, quite reconciles to the cost, the loss of life even, and even to the blunders and shortcomings!</p>
<p>Agassiz reports that a letter he has from Faraday pronounces that “<hi rend="underline">Darwinism</hi>” has about had its day in England.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> But when, at length, A. showed me Faraday’s note, I could not see that it said or implied anything of the sort. It is amusing to see how <hi rend="underline">worried</hi> Agassiz is.</p>
<p>By the way, now that you are in for “reading of the very lightest sort” let some one read to you Agassiz on <hi rend="underline">Glaciers</hi> in the <hi rend="underline">Atlantic</hi> Mag. for November.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> It will not strain your brain, tho’ it may your diaphragm to read how the hairy elephants and the <hi rend="underline">bears</hi> &amp;c were luxuriating in a tropical climate, with their thick coats on to keep them comfortable, when, all of a sudden it changed to bitter winter,—so suddenly that they could not run away, nor even rot, but were <hi rend="underline">frozen up</hi> before there was time for either!</p>
<p>Pray set Wallace<ref target="#foot.f17"/> upon these articles, and upon A’s book just issued, made up of an earlier series of such articles: “Method of Study” (forsooth), and which A. has sent over to European <hi rend="underline">savans</hi> as an important Contribution to Science.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> It is announced, you may see in the preface, that this little book completely does away with all “<hi rend="underline">Darwinism</hi>”<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>Thanks for the little paper on Disa.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>These stamps—of a sort now outlawed here—being clean, may please Master Darwin, or be useful for his exchanges.<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>Ever, dear Darwin— Your sincere | A. Gray</p>

In his review, Wallace defended CD’s argument in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> (3d ed., pp. 254–56) that the complex structure of hive cells, and the more economical use of wax by the hive bee in relation to the humblebee, provided evidence of the hive bee’s development through natural selection (Wallace 1863, pp. 305–7). Wallace noted that many of Haughton’s statements were ‘often so deficient in clearness as to suggest the idea that “The Origin of Species” has been but superficially studied by him’ (p. 304). See CD’s note on Wallace 1863b in DAR 205.11: 126. See also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3922.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hull 1973</ref>, pp. 216–228.</note>

In a series of letters and exchanges with <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4173.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Nicholas Sanders</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2934.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Schaw Lindsay</ref> in October and November 1863, Historicus published and discussed correspondence revealing plans made with the American Confederacy for constructing six iron-clad ships in England. These letters exposed the role of the Confederate agent, Sanders, and the shipping magnate, Lindsay. Lindsay, a leading figure in the pro-Confederate lobby, and MP for Sunderland, also owned one of the two firms that were to build the ships. See, especially, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 23 October 1863, p. 7, and 28 October 1863, p. 9.

Historicus had become an authority on the technicalities of the Foreign Enlistment Act, which made illegal the equipping of a ship for war in the service of a foreign belligerant, and was listened to by the foreign secretary (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4186.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Asa Gray, 26 May 1863</ref> and n. 27, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4177.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Jenkins 1974–80</ref>, 2: 264). On 27 October 1863, the British authorities confiscated two iron-clad vessels as they neared completion at the Birkenhead shipyards; it was believed that these so-called ‘Laird’s rams’ were intended for the American Confederacy (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4325.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, [1 or 3 November 1863]</ref> and n. 21, and <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 29 October 1863, p. 9). Gray may also be referring to newspaper reports of the detention of the <hi rend="italic">Alexandra</hi>, another British-built Confederate ship (see, for example, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 6 November 1863, p. 11, and 7 November 1863, p. 8).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">The seizure of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2785.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Laird’s</ref> two ships (see n. 8, above) reflected the views of the British authorities on the illegality of selling ships to the Confederacy for warfare; editorials in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, in addition to Historicus’s views on the interpretation of the Foreign Enlistment Act, clearly supported this action (see <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 28 October 1863, p. 8, 4 November 1863, p. 6, 7 November 1863, p. 8).</note>
