<p rend="right">Norfolk Island</p>
<p rend="right">January 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. 1873.</p>
<p rend="left">Hon<hi rend="superscript">ble</hi> Sir and Friend,</p>
<p>I have the honor to report to your Excellency the result of our annual election of Magistrate and Councillors. This morning William Quintall, Stephen Christian, and Alfred Nobbs<ref target="#foot.f12"/> the Magistrate and Councillors of last year and reelected on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. ultimo were duly sworn in to their several Departments. The usual routine of reading publicly, the Island Laws, chiefly compiled by Sir William Denison and amended by Sir John Young<ref target="#foot.f13"/> was observed, and other duties and observances were attended to, and will I presume be promptly reported by the Authorities.</p>
<p>My letter dated December 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>. and which I send at this time, no opportunity having previously occurred, will I trust be satisfactory to Your Excellency, the more so as I have requested M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> David Buffett to explain his very incorrect (not intentionally so) averment in such a manner as will exonerate me from any misapplied or unaccounted for expenditure of public moneys.</p>
<p>We are prospering peacefully and comfortably. The School is well conducted by the Schoolmaster, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Revel<ref target="#foot.f14"/>—the number of Scholars ninety seven— There have been but three deaths during the past year—one a man of nearly four score years, an immediate descendant of the “Bounty”—there are now but three survivors—another an accident by fire—and the third, the mother of a large family, from that fell disease pulmonic consumption. The health of the Community is generally good, as Your Excellency will learn from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Watling’s Report, who will also forward a census of the Island.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>On Sunday last we were startled, while the Church bell was ringing for evening service, at the sudden change and then almost extinction of its sound—upon examination next day it was found to be so badly cracked from an imperfection in the casting, that it is totally unfit for use. It is the only bell we have, and sent hither by Sir John Young in consequence of our informing His Excellency that we lacked funds for purchasing so necessary an adjunct to public worship. We are now in a similar strait, and may we ask permission to prefer a similar memorial to Your Excellency—setting forth our need of a bell larger than the one in question, as we have now a more extended parish.</p>
<p>My impression is that the Bell we now have cost fifteen pounds, but one to be of efficient service would cost twice that amount. A bell and Coir matting for the aisles of the Church, to prevent the resonance of its wooden floor, are all that we are in need of, or at least cannot purchase from our communal resources.</p>
<p>I most respectfully apologise for asking these favours and trust the exigencies of the case may be accepted as a plea for making the request.</p>
<p>I am &amp;c | (sd) George H. Nobbs <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
