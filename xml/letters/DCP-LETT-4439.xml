                        <p>I am delighted to hear of the blessed 52 hours immunity from Sickness,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; am buoyed up with the hope of soon being able to run down &amp; seeing you, which I am able to do at any time—but not till you can entirely stand seeing me for a few minutes.</p>
                        <p>I have heard nothing of Scott’s leaving the Ed<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. Bot Gardens—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> his election for L.S. cannot come in I believe till next year, as we elect only one a year,   when the time comes I will let you know &amp; ask you for half a dozen lines apropos addressed to the Council.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                        <p>It is all settled that J<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Smith of Sion shall succeed J<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Smith of Kew<ref target="#foot.f4"/>—but the lazy Treasury have not yet settled the pension for old Smith, which they have had 3 months to think over. They propose to give the new man £180, rising by 10 annually to £250 &amp; house.— We have seen a good deal of him &amp; are vastly pleased with him— My only fear is his breaking down— he is one of those thorough characters who will neglect nothing &amp; try too much at once.</p>
                        <p>I go to Isle of Wight tomorrow with Charlie to meet Tyndall &amp; return on Saturday, my chief object is to take Charlie away whilst Willie comes home for the rest his holiday.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> We had to send the poor boy off on arrival last week to S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Albans to a friend to take care of him! I was near seeing your boys on Sunday, at old Wards with whom I dined, &amp; who would have asked the boys but they had gone home.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I must ask your Willy<ref target="#foot.f7"/> to come to me when we are settled again.</p>
                        <p>I think Huxley had much better have let the Anthropologicals alone— it was a vicious undignified response of his, which did him harm.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I entirely agree about old Jukes, I quite warmed to his letter &amp; his side.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Falconer is one of the 2 classes of Scotchmen that Crawfurd distinguishes as “Scotsman”—&amp; “d——d Scotsman”—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> There are two most curiously antagonistic sides to his character. I cannot approve either his or Prestwiches conduct to themselves or or one-another or to Lyell—nor can I accord to Falconer the credit he demands as a <hi rend="underline">great</hi> discoverer in this bone cave affair—nor to Prestwich the credit F. gives him of being a great philosophic Geologist—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I suppose you have seen Prestwichs resume of his R. Inst. lecture—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I utterly disbelieve his whole theory of River &amp; Ice being the causes— the total length of these wonderful rivers which, according to him, covered <hi rend="underline">many hundreds</hi> of square miles with 30–60 ft of deposits, at elevations of 1–300 ft. above the present river bottoms,—&amp; which transported <hi rend="doubleUnderline">tons</hi> of sandstone on ice, was 50 miles<ref target="#foot.f13"/>—&amp; he quotes my note on the floods of the Soane in corroboration—not reflecting that the Soane drains a county equal to <hi rend="underline">all France</hi> &amp; is fed by tropical rains, &amp; that it does not give rise to similar deposits either.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Then all his reasoning anent man &amp; the Quaternary period is weak as water—neither absolutely false, nor well made out.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I agree with you as to Prestwich’s value as a geological observer &amp;c methodizer of difficult strata &amp;c but doubt at his powers of abstract reasoning &amp; generalization—<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I think his Loess is a myth, &amp; feel confident that the deposits of the Somme valley are comparable as to origin &amp; age with those of the Norfolk coast—&amp; that a tidal ocean in a glacial period had most to do with them both.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> But these Cave discoveries <hi rend="underline">half way up</hi> the Rock of: Gibraltar<ref target="#foot.f18"/> must modify extensively all our views of the outline &amp; condition of Europe during the early period of man’s history: &amp; it now becomes most important to know what was its configuration before 30 feet of deposits were heaped up over the works of man &amp; spread over so large an area of N. France. that the existing rivers terraced the valleys as we now find them I quite believe, but not that they first spread this enormous deposit over both the hills &amp; valleys.</p>
                        <p>I know nothing of Blyth nor where he intends to take up his quarters.— unfortunately he drinks.<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
                        <p>Owens Lecture is published but I have not seen it,<ref target="#foot.f20"/> I will enquire about it.</p>
                        <p>Siphomeris is a synonym of Lecontea—Rubiaceæ   the species is a nondescript.<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
                        <p>Thanks many for A Grays letter— how doucely he takes the changed aspect of affairs.<ref target="#foot.f22"/></p>
                        <p>I am very glad that you have had Jenners opinion, he seems to be an extraordinarily able man— glad enough I am that he finds nothing organic the matter—<ref target="#foot.f23"/></p>
                        <p>As to Veitch we find him the closest-fisted fellow we have anything to do with—<ref target="#foot.f24"/> he sends to us for any plant he &amp; the trade have not in cultivation, &amp; sells it at enormous prices &amp; professing to give us in exchange—he sends the shabbiest morsels imaginable— if he sends a plant to be figured in Bot Mag. he mutilates it lest we should grow it!—<ref target="#foot.f25"/> My Father treated his son when he went to Japan,<ref target="#foot.f26"/> like his own, got him an <hi rend="underline">autograph</hi> circular from Lord John Russell to the powers that be<ref target="#foot.f27"/>—&amp; gave him private letters to all his correspondents: besides giving him Botanical outfit &amp;c.—but he has not had the grace even to call on my father since his return, nor given him a dried plant for his collection or live one for the Garden or pine-cone for the Museum.— Yet he perpetually sends me plants to name! I am very glad that the father treats you better than us, his is the only firm of nurserymen who we do not <hi rend="underline">get on</hi> <hi rend="underline">with.</hi></p>
                        <p>I surely told you that Vanilla climbs by rootlets alone.<ref target="#foot.f28"/> I do not think that it even twists its shoots—but will look.</p>
                        <p>I will look to <hi rend="underline">Nepenthes</hi> if I can.<ref target="#foot.f29"/> You have it I suppose.</p>
                        <p>We are all pretty well—&amp; have no news— I like the Reader much, but am hard up for a weekly political paper, I gave up the London Review when it began to snuffle to the low X,<ref target="#foot.f30"/> &amp; look to the Spectator, which I now abominate; it is as unfair as the Athenæum unscrupulous as the Times &amp; wrong as the Saturday—<ref target="#foot.f31"/> We have no paper like the old Spectator in Rintouls time.<ref target="#foot.f32"/></p>
                        <p>I have letters from Hector talking of the “glacier origin of all the W. Coast valleys.”<ref target="#foot.f33"/> I think Jukes &amp; Ramsay carry glacial action much too far.<ref target="#foot.f34"/></p>
                        <p>Did I tell you that the <hi rend="underline">Pinus peuce</hi> found on one solitary mountain of <hi rend="underline">Western</hi> Macedonia being the famous <hi rend="underline">P. excelsa</hi> of Himalaya<ref target="#foot.f35"/>—the most wonderful case of an outlier on record—as the <hi rend="underline">P. excelsa</hi> is not found W. of Affghanistan.</p>
