                    <p>You will think that I have been very neglectful, in not having sooner thanked you for the wing of the goose, the photograph &amp; your last interesting letter; but I thought it best to wait until receiving Professor Flower’s report, &amp; you will see by the enclosed the cause of his delay.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> If you are willing to take the trouble to get your interesting case thoroughly investigated, it will be necessary to procure from the owner the wings of half a dozen birds, some of them quite young; &amp; if possible the old one which had his wing broken. They ought to be sent in spirits, &amp; they had better be addressed to Prof. Flower<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>

                    <p>And I had better be informed when they are dispatched. Should you be inclined to take so much trouble, I hope that you will allow me to say that I should be very glad to pay for the geese &amp; for the several other contingent expenses. Your first letter &amp; Prof: Flower’s had better be returned to me hereafter<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>There is one other point which ought if possible to be ascertained; viz when the old gander had his wing broken was it wounded so that blood was discharged? If wounded did the wound suppurate? Did the wing heal quickly or slowly   These are important points in relation to the inheritance of mutilations. </p>
                    <p>Pray accept my best thanks for your kindness &amp; I remain, Dear Sir, | Yours faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>
