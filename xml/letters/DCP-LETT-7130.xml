            <p>HM intends studying bees to find evidence supporting CD’s theories. His work has shown him there are problems in separating species from varieties, and has also revealed many surprising instances of variation in habits.</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to you for your assistance in obtaining Mr Fr. Smith’s willingness to revise my Westfalian bees.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> My wishes on this head are perfectly accomplished by your kind mediation, and now I can begin more confidently to elaborate the matter that occupies me since two years.</p>
<p>From a paper, I lately have sent to you, you will have seen, that I intended at first to try an employment of your doctrine on flowers and insects visiting flowers in general.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But this whole matter being extremely extensive, I have resolved now to elaborate previously only a single section of it, namely the employment of your doctrine on the bees, being adapted in their parts of mouth and in their pollen-collecting apparatus to their nourishment gained from flowers.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>So turning my attention chiefly to the bees of my neighbourhood, I have found, that this family of insects also in many other regards is highly abundant of facts decisive for your theorie. It is, for instant, very rich of doubtful forms ranked by one Zoologist as a species and by another as a variety, it is very rich of species which differ but very slightly from each other, and the differences, in the one case judged as sufficient for the distinction of species, in the other case looked at as mere varieties, blend into each other in an insensible series.— In the family of bees further there are found many surprising instances of variation of instincts—</p>
<p>I have encountered also many pecularities in the one sex, that can only be acquired by inheritance from the other sex etc. These and other observations, occasionally made, have determinated myself, to exceed, considering the family of bees, the exact limits of my original thema and to treat in its various regards the employment of your theorie—on bees</p>
<p>Till the end of this year I hope to have finished the first memoir on this subject.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Nevertheless I will have, also during next summer, an eye on all facts relating to the whole thema, and I would be very much obliged to you, if you would communicate to me all your scruples and objections against my statements in the paper lately sent to you.</p>
<p>As you have corrected repeatedly, in former cases, my opinions, I hope, you will also in this case do so.</p>
<p>With the greatest respect | I remain, | my dear Sir, | yours very faithfully | H Müller.</p>
