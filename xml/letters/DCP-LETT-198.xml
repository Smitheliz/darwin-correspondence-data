<p>I have received your parcel containing a book &amp;c and a letter for my Brother. I will forward them by the first opportunity, and will follow your suggestion in endeavouring to obtain the Anatomie des Mollusques which I do not think he at present has.</p>
<p>I feel very much obliged to you for the two letters you are so good as to send. I have had great pleasure in reading them, and will gladly make use of your permission to send them home, and will take care that they are returned to you.</p>
<p>I do not know whether I can be of any assistance to you either in receiving or forwarding the Boxes which my Brother may send to you, and can only beg that you will make any use of me that may be convenient</p>
<p>I remain yours, | Sincerely obliged | E. Darwin *S 2</p>

<p>P.S. My Brother mentions in his letter that his Box is to be forwarded through Capt. Fitz Roy’s Agent at Falmouth    The former agent of Capt Fitz Roy (I forget his name) failed and I had in consequence considerable difficulty in sending out some books. If you should happen to know the address of the present Agent who forwarded the Box, I should feel exceedingly obliged to you if you could send it to me. I should not venture to give you so much trouble if I were not so well acquainted with all your kindness to my Brother.</p>
