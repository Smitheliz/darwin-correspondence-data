<p>I have now read your essay with very great interest.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Your view of the origin of local races through “amixie” is altogether new to me, and seems to throw an important light on an obscure problem.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> There is however something strange about the periods or endurance or variability.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I formerly endeavoured to investigate the subject, not by looking to past time, but to species of the same genus widely distributed; and I found in many cases that all the species, with perhaps one or two exceptions, were variable. It would be a very interesting subject for a conchologist to investigate, viz: whether the species of the same genus were variable during many successive geological formations. I began to make enquiries on this head, but failed in this, as in so many other things, from the want of time and strength. In your remarks on crossing you do not, as it seems to me, lay nearly stress enough on the increased vigour of the offspring derived from parents which have been exposed to different conditions. I have during the last 5 years been making experiments on this subject with plants, and have been astonished at the results, which have not yet been published.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>In the first part of your essay I thought that you wasted (to use an English expression) too much powder and shot on M. Wagner; but I changed my opinion when I saw how admirably you treated the whole case, and how well you used the facts about the Planorbis.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I wish I had studied this latter case more carefully. The manner in which, as you show, the different varieties blend together and make a constant whole, agrees perfectly with my hypothetical illustrations<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Many years ago the late E. Forbes described three closely consecutive beds in a Secondary formation, each with representative forms of the same fresh water shells: the case is evidently analogous with that of Hilgendorf, but the interesting connecting varieties or links were here absent.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I rejoice to think that I formerly said as emphatically as I could, that neither isolation nor time by themselves do anything for the modification of species.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Hardly anything in your essay has pleased me so much personally, as to find that you believe to a certain extent in sexual selection.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> As far as I can judge, very few naturalists believe in this. I may have erred on many points, and extended the doctrine too far, but I feel a strong conviction that sexual selection will hereafter be admitted to be a powerful agency. I cannot agree with what you say about the taste for beauty in animals not easily varying.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> It may be suspected that even the habit of viewing differently coloured surrounding objects would influence their taste, and Fritz Müller even goes so far as to believe that the sight of gaudy butterflies might influence the taste of distinct species.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> There are many remarks and statements in your essay which have interested me greatly, and I thank you for the pleasure which I have received from reading it.</p>
<p>With sincere respect, I remain | My dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>If you should ever be induced to consider the whole doctrine of sexual selection, I think that you will be led to the conclusion that characters thus gained by one sex are very commonly transferred in a greater or less degree to the other sex.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD had received Weismann’s essay on the influence of isolation on the formation of species (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8272.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Weismann 1872</ref>) in February 1872 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8228.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to August Weismann, 29 February 1872</ref> and n. 3).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Weismann coined the term <hi rend="italic">Amixie</hi> to refer to the total prevention of crossing between two populations due to isolation (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8272.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Weismann 1872</ref>, p. 49 n. 3). Weismann argued that <hi rend="italic">Amixie</hi> did not necessarily result in the formation of new species and conversely that <hi rend="italic">Amixie</hi> was not a necessary requirement in the formation of new species. He cited examples to illustrate his argument (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 49–51).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Weisman hypothesised that populations experienced periods of increased variability interspersed with longer periods of constancy and argued that periods of variability could be triggered by changes in external conditions. Isolation was only one sort of change that might be encountered (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8272.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Weismann 1872</ref>, pp. 51–2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD refers to his research on successive generations of cross-fertilised and self-fertilised plants, published in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8595.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Cross and self fertilisation</hi></ref> in 1876.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4916.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Moritz Wagner</ref> had argued that a population had to be isolated geographically in order to form new species (Wagner 1868a, 1868b, and 1870). Using successive varieties of a ram’s horn snail referred to as <hi rend="italic">Planorbis multiformis</hi>, Weismann argued that new species could form without being isolated from the parent species (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8272.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Weismann 1872</ref>, p. 15). Ram’s horn snails are freshwater pulmonate gastropods; the species referred to as <hi rend="italic">P. multiformis</hi> are now in the genus <hi rend="italic">Gyraulus</hi>; see Nützel and Bandel 1993, p. 318).</note>

Later in the same section (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 366–7), CD presented a hypothetical case of successive species found in different strata in order to show the difficulty of determining intermediate varieties that originated from a common progenitor.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1680.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Forbes</ref> had described different forms of the same genera of freshwater gastropods in three distinct strata in his preliminary report on the strata and organic remains in the Dorsetshire Purbecks (Forbes 1850, pp. 80–1).</note>
