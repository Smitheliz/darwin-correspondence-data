            <p>CD called on Baugh but found him adamant; he has already laid the case before the [Charity] Commissioners and if necessary will take it to a Court of Equity.</p>

<p>I received your note yesterday, &amp; this morning after breakfast I called on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Baugh.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am extremely sorry to say that I have not been of slightest use, for he has actually already called at the office of the Commissioners &amp; laid the case before them! I think I ought, also, to tell you that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Baugh said if the Commissioners would not take up the case, as being out of their jurisdiction he would put it in a Court of Equity, &amp; that he had had the case laid before some lawyer, who thought it a proper one for such Court, &amp; that owing to the exclusion of the Clergy (as I understood) he (the lawyer) thought all the interest would have to be refunded.—</p>
<p>I endeavoured to oppose all this by urging the great loss to the Fund; but he said that probably he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. (in such case) call a vestry at Farnborough, lay the whole correspondence before it, &amp; endeavour &amp; get up a subscription for law-expences.— I hinted that were you forced to give way, you had said that you <hi rend="underline">could</hi> soon recover by withholding what you now do for the parishioners of Farnborough. I said nothing about the Archbishop.— But it is no use saying or doing anything.— He seems very determined, even more than before, &amp; reiterated that he felt himself bound to act for the good of his Parish.—</p>
<p>I wish I could have been of any assistance, and | Pray believe me | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>I have taken a House (28 York Place Baker St) for a month, &amp; we all move on Thursday morning; I hope to meet your son at some of the Scientific Soc.<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. which I intend to attend.</p>
