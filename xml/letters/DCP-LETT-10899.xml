<p>I have been deeply gratified by the very great honour which has been conferred on me by a naturalist so well known as yourself, having thought it worth while to publish an account of what I have been able to do in natural Science.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I cannot read the Dutch language, but one of my sons has translated to me large portions of your essay, &amp; the extremely kind manner in which you speak of my works has delighted me.</p>
<p>An account of your countrymen’s generous sympathy in having sent me on my birthday the magnificent Album has been published in almost every newspaper throughout England.; &amp; you may well believe that the present has given me &amp; my family lasting pleasure.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I beg you once again to accept my cordial thanks, &amp; to believe me with much respect, Dear Sir | yours faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>
