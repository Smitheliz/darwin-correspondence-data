<p>A book by J. W. Colenso [<hi rend="italic">The Pentateuch and book of Joshua critically examined</hi>, pt 1 (1862)] has just appeared and will "make a noise".</p>  
<p>Would like some observations made on <hi rend="italic">Cypripedium</hi>.</p>  
<p>Will not publish yet on <hi rend="italic">Lythrum</hi> as he must make many more crosses; the mid-styled is fertile with half of its own stamens.</p> 
            <p>Would like to try a few experiments on tendrils.</p>

                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>When your note of Oct 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, (chiefly about Max Muller) arrived I was nearly at the end of the same book &amp; had intended recommending you to read it!<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I quite agree that it is extremely interesting, but the latter part about <hi rend="underline">first</hi> origin of language much the least satisfactory.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It is a marvellous problem. I have heard, whether truly or not I do not know, but the book has rather given me the same impression, that he is dreadfully afraid of not being thought strictly orthodox. He even hints at truth of Tower of Babel!<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I thus accounted for covert sneers at me, which he seems to get the better of towards the close of the book.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I cannot quite see how it will forward “my cause” as you call it; but I can see how anyone with literary talent (I do not feel up to it) could make great use of the subject, in illustration. What pretty metaphors you would make from it!<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I wish some one would keep a lot of the most noisy monkeys, half free, &amp; study their means of communication!</p>
<p>A book has just appeared here, which will, I suppose make a noise, by Bishop Colenso, who, judging from extracts smashes most of the old Testament.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Talking of Books, I am in middle of one which pleases me, though it is very innocent food, viz “Miss Cooper’s Journal of Naturalist”. <hi rend="underline">Who is she</hi>?<ref target="#foot.f8"/> She seems a very clever woman &amp; gives a capital account of the battle between <hi rend="underline">our</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">your</hi> weeds.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Does it not hurt your Yankee pride that we thrash you so confoundedly. I am sure M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Gray will stick up for your own weeds. Ask her whether they are not more honest downright good sort of weeds.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> The Book gives an extremely pretty picture of one of your villages; but I see your autumn, though so much more gorgeous than ours, comes on sooner, &amp; that is one comfort.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you have sent off your account of orchids to Newhaven; let me have a copy if you can, for I see no periodicals.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I wish you had an active pupil in the country: it would be curious to block up with cotton or something the holes on each side of the sterile anther in Cypripedium; &amp; then if pollen were at all disturbed it would show that little insects had entered by the toe.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I shall be very glad indeed of Mitchella, &amp; of seed, if possible, of Nessæa. I am more than ever interested in Lythrum; the seed of my 88 crossed flowers prove truth of diagram, if you remember it;<ref target="#foot.f13"/> but there is something more, mid-styled is in addition moderately fertile with half its own stamens, &amp; I must make many more crosses, &amp; shall not publish this year—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> The case, I think, is worth any labour.—</p>
<p>I did not know, &amp; yet doubt, that it was Hooker who reviewed me so gorgeously in Gardeners Ch<hi rend="superscript">le</hi>. but I have asked him.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>Now for two questions: please give me <hi rend="underline">reference</hi> to your notice of Gourds affecting each others fruit;<ref target="#foot.f16"/> &amp; secondly on the movements of the tendrils.—<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>Also do you know of any treatise descriptive of all your vars. of Maize, if so give me title.—; if I fail to get here, could you help me to half-a-dozen grains of the most marked varieties of Maize.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/> What a good book “Downing on Fruit” is.—<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>I am crawling steadily on &amp; today have been compiling all about peaches &amp; nectarines; &amp; a curious case it is.—<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to try a few experiments on your Tendrils;<ref target="#foot.f21"/> I wonder what would be good &amp; easy plant to raise in pot.</p>
<p>Farewell, my dear Gray. God help your poor country, though perhaps you scorn our pity. Farewell, my good friend | C. Darwin</p>

Language is our Rubicon, and no brute will dare to cross it. This is our matter of fact answer to those who speak of development, who think they discover the rudiments at least of all human faculties in apes, and who would fain keep open the possibility that man is only a more favoured beast, the triumphant conqueror in the primeval struggle for life. Language is something more palpable than a fold of the brain, or an angle of the skull. It admits of no cavilling, and no process of natural selection will ever distill significant words out of the notes of birds or the cries of beasts. </quote> Towards the end of the book, however, Max Müller used Darwin’s concept of natural selection to account for the development of human language (p. 371).</note>
