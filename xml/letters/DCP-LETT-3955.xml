<p>I am now going to pester you with a question.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> In the cultivation of peach trees in enclosed houses I have found that they cannot be kept in health unless the fresh air is admitted so that it enters at a lower level &amp; makes its way <hi rend="underline">under</hi> the leaves as at <hi rend="underline">a</hi></p> 
<figure type="diagram"> 
<p>[DIAG HERE] Mem the lines [DIAG HERE] are to be supposed the two walls of a house</p> </figure> 
<p>rising as it becomes rarefied by the heat of the house, &amp; that air admitted at the upper part of the wall of a glass roofed house as at <hi rend="underline">b</hi> will not keep peach trees in health   this has induce〈d〉 me to think that the lungs 〈of〉 the leaves (so to speak) are on the under surface— there is as you know much difference in the appearance of the two surfaces. Now can you by employing a powerful microscope &amp; your power of mind do anything for me in this matter?</p>
<p>Referring to my last<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I was brought to my, I fear, idle reasoning on the effects of soil &amp; climate on our race by observing for several years past English gardeners &amp; nurserymen visiting here who had lived from seven to ten years in the United States of America some from the far west others in the sea-board states with only one exception &amp; he was a Scotchman, I remarked that in their features &amp; figures they had assumed the genuine American type the cheekbones in most cases high the nose thin &amp; if in the least inclining to the aquiline this peculiarity much agravated. the cheeks hollow the eyes sunken everything belonging to them reminding one of the normal Indian race. I have often expressed my surprise to those men that soil &amp; climate would have so changed them &amp; they have admitted that they felt a change not only in their persons but in a rush of fierce energy unknown to us at home.</p>
<p>These facts are all straws but they may give a hint however trifling to your reasoning powers</p>
