                    <p>My brother writing from Calcutta says: “The closing of the leaves of the sensitive plant and the dropping of the stalks is apparently for protection as <hi rend="underline">when they are closed you can hardly distinguish</hi> <hi rend="underline">the pl〈ant〉 on the brown earth</hi>, and i〈t〉 would clearly be an advantage to hide thus when attacked by a goat or locusts.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The closing of the leaves at night too would protect the plant from beetles &amp; fireflies which play havoc with leave〈s〉 〈at〉 night. I find 〈ma〉ny p〈lants〉 with 〈lea〉ves like the Sensitive plant (or Acacia) close them at night.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>My sensitive plant is not affected when touched or even roughly stroked with a blade of grass, nor was it affected when the grass was laid on &amp; then lifted off.</p>
                    <p>There is a sensitive plant precisely like the ordinary one that grows 〈i〉n water—running along the surface. The leaves are larger, and the flower white &amp; larger but in other respects the plants look the same.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Strong shaking by our strong winds does not close the leaves of the water plant, but the land one closes slightly under the same 〈ci〉rcumstances.”</p>
<p>Three things str〈u〉ck me in my brothers remarks:</p>
<p>1. The difficulty of seeing the closed sensitive plant on the brown baked earth of India.</p>
<p>2. The multitude of night flying fireflies and insects found in India, from which a plant might find protection useful.</p>
<p>3. The fact of there being a <hi rend="underline">water</hi> sensitive plant—which however may not be new to you.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully | J I Rogers. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
