                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
<p>I had intended writing to you to say that I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> send the M.S. for the first number to you by our weekly carrier on Thursday morning. I have much condensed, added to, &amp; improved the scientific part: As nearly as I can possibly calculate; there will be 168 pages of your volume.</p>
<p>I have well considered &amp; consulted others on title-page: I think from honesty &amp; policy (as the work has been much quoted) we must keep to nearly the same title: I hope you will approve of the enclosed, which is strictly accurate &amp; does not give the idea of exclusive science, as the ‘Journal’ is so prominent. I do not know how far you value M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lyells’ judgment, but he approves of it.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Should you [not] object to the enclosed short Dedication, it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> much gratify <hi rend="underline">me</hi> to insert it?—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I enclose the map, of which I have the copper-plate. To my own taste &amp; that of every person, whom I ever heard speak of the subject, a map in a volume of Travels is <hi rend="doubleUnderline">very</hi> agreeable: please inform me of your decision before Wednesday night, that I may send it or not with the M.S.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Please return the Map and Title &amp; Dedication: of the latter I beg you not say a word to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lyell..</p>
<p>I have borrowed a few woodcuts from my Geological volumes: &amp; I have had one made at 12<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. as I thought it very desirable to illustrate a description of a curious Bird:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I will direct M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lee to take it &amp; the account to you, if you approve, if not I will pay it myself.—</p>
<p>Will the Table of Contents ie Chapters belonging to the First Number be published in the First Number, or the whole Contents in the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> number?—</p>
<p>The condensing the scientific parts &amp; additions have cost me infinitely more time than I anticipated, otherwise I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have sent the M.S. sooner.</p>
<p>Finally—I take the liberty of calling your attention to the fact, that when you offered me 100£, it was for the two numbers. I did not choose to throw any obstacle in our arrangements; nor of course will I now do so; but for the copyright of my Journal in three numbers, I think 100£ is 〈    〉<ref target="#foot.f5"/> sum. Do you think you could afford to allow me an additional fifty? I assure you I have taken the utmost pains with this new Edition</p>
<p>Believe me dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | C. Darwin <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> To | J. Murray E<hi rend="superscript">qre</hi>.</p>
