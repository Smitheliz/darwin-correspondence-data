<p>In my last communication I said that Gärtner had proved that the colour of the Pea in one variety of the garden Pea may be changed by the direct action of the pollen of another differently-coloured variety.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Mr. Beaton<ref target="#foot.f3"/> authoritatively remarks on this: “Gärtner never found that—he only asserted it; and when he was pushed to the proof he lowered his sails, made a second edition of his great work, and confessed many of his errors.”<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He adds, “No cross-breeder of any practice in England at the present day would like to have his name associated with that of Gärtner for or against any exploit in crossing.”</p>
<p>I should have taken no notice of this, although I should be sorry to lie under the imputation of having made an entirely incorrect statement, and although it is not pleasant to be flatly contradicted; but I wish much to be allowed to endeavour to vindicate the memory of one of the most laborious lovers of truth who ever lived. It is painful to see a long life of honest labour repaid by contumely from a fellow-experimentalist, who, I suppose—anyhow I hope—never read one page of the great original work—namely, the “Bastarderzeugung,” published in 1849, a mine of wealth to all who will explore it.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Gärtner, when young, and at the very commencement of his long work, committed a very foolish action; he crossed a number of plants belonging to distinct genera without having taken due precaution to exclude insects, and when he found their capsules full of seed, he thought that he had succeeded in crossing them. With the enthusiasm of a beginner he most unwisely published the result, and to this first paper Dr. Herbert has alluded with proper blame.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> When Gärtner found his seedlings came up pure, he, like an honest and excellent man (as all who knew anything of his life will admit that he was), publicly confessed his error.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Gärtner’s great and last work, entitled “Versuche über die Bastarderzeugung,”<ref target="#foot.f8"/> contains in 790 closely-printed pages the detailed results of nine thousand distinct experiments in crossing, together with admirable observations on the whole subject of hybridisation. This is a greater number of experiments than, as I believe, have ever been published by any other man, even by Kölreuter,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> and a far greater number than those published by Dr. Herbert.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> One great superiority in Gärtner’s work over those of Kölreuter, Herbert, and others consists in his having actually taken the trouble to count the seeds in the capsules of every cross and hybrid which he made. He kept an exact record at the time of making each experiment; and this I have reason to believe was not done by Herbert, and certainly has been very far from the case with other English experimentalists.</p>
<p>I cannot resist here mentioning—as some who honour, as I do, the memory of Dr. Herbert, might like to hear the fact—that I have reason to believe that the last words ever uttered by Herbert were on his favourite subject of crossing. I called on him in London, and saw that he was very feeble. I wished to leave him, but he stopped me, and talked with much interest on this subject. An hour or two afterwards, as far as I could judge by the published account, he was found dead in the chair in which I left him.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>But to return to the Pea-question. An account of the various crosses made by Gärtner (he selected the most constant varieties) between differently coloured Peas, with the results given in detail, will be found at page 81 to 85 in his “Bastarderzeugung.” Gärtner was led to try these experiments from doubting the accuracy of Wiegmann’s statements,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> and he found many of them incorrect; but he was compelled to believe in the Pea case;<ref target="#foot.f13"/> not that Peas can be crossed with Vetches, to which other statement of Wiegmann Mr. Beaton alludes. I may add that Gärtner knew of the account, published in vol. v., pages 234, 237 of the “Transactions of the Horticultural Society of London,” on the influence of pollen on Peas.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> In an old volume of the “Philosophical Transactions,” vol. xliii., page 525, there is a full account, with every appearance of truth, of Peas in adjoining rows affecting each other.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> The Rev. M. J. Berkeley has, as I have been informed, subsequently to the publication of Gärtner’s book, tried again the Pea-experiment with the same result.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">It is not clear to which of Gärtner’s publications Beaton refers. Gärtner’s experiments on the direct action of pollen in varieties of peas were published in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2732.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gärtner 1826</ref> and 1849; he had originally argued that foreign pollen never affected the appearance of the seed in the female parent (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2732.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gärtner 1826</ref>, pp. 36, 61), but in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2736.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gärtner 1849</ref>, he revised this opinion, and conceded that in one variety of garden pea the direct action of foreign pollen on the female parent had been observed (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2736.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gärtner 1849</ref>, p. 84).
