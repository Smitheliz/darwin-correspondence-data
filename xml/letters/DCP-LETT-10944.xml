<p>Though there may not be much that is new to you in D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wood’s Lecture on Insectivorous plants, I am sure you will like to see it, and I have begged a copy for you which I send by mail with this today.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I took occasion to note recently that plants did not always behave in one place as they do in others,—and I incidentally referred to your experience with <hi rend="underline">Linum perenne</hi>, to illustrate my point.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I did this by no means to antagonize your observations, <hi rend="underline">but quite on the contrary</hi>, to help strengthen them with those who might see cases like mine, and suspect there might be some error in the original observation. I endeavored to show a good reason for seemingly differing experiences. My friend D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gray seems to take it another way, and writes to me that I might at least have waited to see whether or not the plant in America is heterostyled before making the remark,—that perhaps the <hi rend="underline">L. Lewisii</hi> is not after all <hi rend="underline">L. sibirica</hi> or <hi rend="underline">L. perenne</hi>, but entitled to distinctive rank.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> So far there is a good point in the suggestion that we should go over again and examine the matter, and I am sure I shall look into it with much pleasure. But as we had all of us come to the conclusion that they were identical, the doubt did not occur to me,— so that while I am glad of the suggestion to examine our form again, I think I may be pardoned for having referred to it as I did.</p>
<p>Though I cannot quite see just as you do, as to the deductions to be drawn from some of the observations,—I am so much in accord with so many of your views, and am so much indebted indeed to all of your labors, that I should be annoyed to be thought an “antagonist”.</p>
<p>With best respects and wishes, believe me dear Sir | Very truly Yours | Thomas Meehan</p>

CD’s copy is in DAR 226.2: 168.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Meehan wrote, in a letter published in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club</hi>, December 1877, p. 189: <quote>However, it is well to recognize the fact, that plants, and, no doubt, insects, behave differently in different places. For instance, Mr. Darwin from English experiments utterly denies that <hi rend="italic">Linum perennne</hi> can fertilize itself by its own pollen. He says we may as well ‘sprinkle over it so much inorganic dust.’ But a single plant, which I brought with me from Colorado in 1873, bears fruit freely in my garden every year. It shows that how a plant may behave in one place is no rule as to how it will elsewhere.</quote> CD had written, ‘Now we know positively that, so far from <hi rend="italic">Linum perenne</hi> being fertilised by its own pollen in the bud, its own pollen is as powerless on the stigma as so much inorganic dust’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, p. 98). <hi rend="italic">Linum perenne</hi> is blue flax.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Some taxonomists gave specific status to blue flax from western areas of North America, including Colorado, referring to it as <hi rend="italic">Linum lewisii</hi>; others considered it to be a variety of <hi rend="italic">L. perenne</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Linum sibiricum</hi> is a synonym of <hi rend="italic">L. perenne</hi>. CD had already written to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref> mentioning Meehan’s remarks on <hi rend="italic">Linum perenne</hi>, and after consulting <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref>, expressed the opinion that the Colorado <hi rend="italic">Linum</hi> was, at least functionally, a distinct species (see letters to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11330.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">21 [and 22] January 1878</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11364.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">17 February [1878]</ref>).
