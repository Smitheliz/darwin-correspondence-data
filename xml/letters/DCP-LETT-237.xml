<p>This is your Birthday; so I must begin my letter to wish you joy, and many happy <hi rend="underline">returns</hi> of it (but not abroad) mind that.</p>
<p>Papa who never forgets anniversarys remembered this day of course at Breakfast and sends you his best love &amp; blessing on reaching 25 years. Poor old Nurse Nancy entertained me all the time I was dressing this mor<hi rend="superscript">g</hi> with many lamentations over your absence on this day when you ought to be eating Plum pudding with us, &amp; all the Servants say she has not failed to put them in mind of you; so as I have often told you before, you are not forgotten by the least of us.—</p>
<p>We are very anxious for your next letter to tell us how you escaped from Buenos Ayres &amp; what is become of yr Luggage, but before this month is up I hope to hear news of you.— My Sisters have told you how very much we enjoyed your Journal and what a nice amusing book of travels it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. make if printed, but there is one part of your Journal as your Granny I shall take in hand namely several little errors in orthography of which I shall send you a list that you may profit by my lectures tho’ the world is between us.— so here goes.—</p> 
<figure type="diagram"> 
<p>wrong right according to sense. ——————————————————— loose. lan<hi rend="underline">s</hi>cape. hi<hi rend="underline">ge</hi>st lose. landscape. highest. profil. cann<hi rend="underline">a</hi>bal profile. cannibal. peaceable peac<hi rend="underline">i</hi>ble. quarre<hi rend="underline">ll</hi> quarrel.— I daresay these errors</p>
<p>are the effect of haste, but as your</p>
<p>Granny it is my duty to point them</p>
<p>out.—</p> </figure> 
<p>We have had the most surprising mild winter that ever was known or at least that I remember: not one days hard frost or anything like snow. I regret this for no reason except the Ice house being empty.— In consequence of this our Spring flowers in Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> are in full blow but there is no pleasure with them so early.—</p>
<p>Parliament has just met &amp; we read aloud the debates in the Eve<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. O’Connell<ref target="#foot.f1"/> still keeps the upperhand by talking &amp; boring the House with Irelands wrongs till one is quite sick of him &amp; his country.— I suppose Church &amp; Corn Laws will be the great things this Session.—</p>
<p>We have not heard from Erasmus the last month he has taken a naughty fit and nothing can make him write. we have all three written in turns to reproach him in vain. Last year once he did the samething &amp; then he confessed afterwards that he kept silent so long on purpose as he hoped to make us believe he was gone abroad.— He is quite a grand gentleman now with his own Cab and horse— we are expecting from London every day a new little Phaeton as the Car is pronounced quite <hi rend="underline">unseaworthy</hi>.—</p>
<p>We had a very gay day yesterday 6 Owens came over to see a famous Conjuror perform at the Fox Inn which tempted M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Owen to bring over Baby—&amp; we were all much amused: his chief feat was shewing us how <hi rend="underline">to sit upon</hi> <hi rend="underline">nothing</hi>! which certainly might be a very useful accomplishment.</p>
<p>Francis Owen sails this Summer for the East Indies—how pleased poor Arthur will be to see him.—</p>
<p>Next time we have any opportunity of sending you books I 〈sha〉ll certainly send you “Peter Simple” the best Novel that has come out a long time, &amp; will just suit you now as it is written by a Naval Officer Captain Maryatt:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> and the sea terms which puzzled us you will understand &amp; relish.— About a fortnight ago I went to Acton Burnell<ref target="#foot.f3"/> to stay three days to meet the Owens. I enjoyed my visit extremely as I had never been there before &amp; we walked a great deal about the Park which is very beautiful Emma Owen &amp; I went to Mass one mor<hi rend="superscript">g</hi> very early and I never saw anything like the mummery that was performed by the Priest and one of the Footmen in Livery who I suppose acted as Clerk— One of the Priests seemed to be quite captivated by Emma made her presents, and I am sure hopes to make a Convert of her— He has sent her a pair of Slippers worked by himself.— We have not seen Fanny Biddulph for some time the last thing we heard of was her sending poor <hi rend="underline">Bijou</hi> the Poodle to Ireland with a Capt White who has begged it from her— The poor Dog latterly had been kept quite shut up at Chirk Castle so it is rather a happy change for it.—</p>
<p>Yesterday Robert Wedgwood came over here on his road to Welsh Pool to look at a Living which William Clive has offered to give him: but as it is only worth 120 pound a year he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not be better off than at Maer with his two Curacys so I suppose he will not accept it.— We are just returned from spending three days at Ness where Capt Cotton<ref target="#foot.f4"/> one of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Cottons brothers was staying. he is a Navy Capt. just returned after 5 years absence &amp; we heard a gt deal of naval talk. he is very handsome &amp; agreeable, &amp; remembers having once seen Capt Fitzroy as a Midshipman.—</p>
<p>It is in vain to keep my letter any longer open for the chance of hearing from you as I am afraid you must have sailed for Valparaiso without being able to write fr Buenos Ayres so Good bye my dearest old Charley from y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> very affectionate Susan Darwin</p>
