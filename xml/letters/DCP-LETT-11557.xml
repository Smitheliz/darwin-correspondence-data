                    <p>Very many thanks for your permission to use your observations, as well as for the additional information which you have supplied.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> If all the manuscript chapter on instinct is of the same quality as the enclosed portion, it must be very valuable. Time will prevent me from treating very fully of instinct in my lecture, but when I come to write the book for the International Science Series on Comparative Psychology, I shall try to say all that I can on instinct.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Your letter, therefore, induces me to say that I hope your notes will be published somewhere before my book comes out (<hi rend="underline">i.e.</hi> within a year or so), or, if you have no intention of publishing the notes, that you would, as you say, let me read the manuscript, as the references, &amp;c., would be much more important for the purposes of the book than for those of the lecture. But, of course, I should not ask to publish your work in my book, unless you have no intention of publishing it yourself. I do not know why you have kept it so long unpublished, and your having offered me the manuscript for preparing my lecture makes me think that you might not object to lending it me for preparing my book. But please understand that I only think this on the supposition that, from its unsuitable length, isolated character, or other reason, you do not see your way to publishing the chapter yourself.</p>
