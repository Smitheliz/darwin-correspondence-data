                    <salute>My dear Sir</salute>

                <div type="transcription">
<p>Many thanks for your most kind offer of the Eggs of the Rumpless Polands.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Will you be so kind as to send them by enclosed address as soon as you conveniently can, as we have a Hen ready to sit: it is really a shame accepting so many as a dozen, but I shall by having so many be able to see whether the Breed comes <hi rend="underline">true</hi> as Rumpless.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> <hi rend="underline">Have you found them true</hi>??</p>
<p>With respect to the Scanderoons my pair has never laid an egg since those which produced your pair.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am ashamed to say that I do not know Cock from Hen.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Would you like to have the pair to try to breed from; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think the change might very likely make them breed. All that I now want of them is a carcass for skeleton &amp; measurement in fresh state. If you like to have them, I must send them off on a Wednesday <hi rend="underline">night</hi>, so that you would have somehow to get them home before late on the Thursday.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have now got some Fowls from the Dyaks of the interior of Borneo sent me by the Rajah:<ref target="#foot.f7"/> shall I send them to you at same time?</p>
<p>Will you tell me what <hi rend="underline">colour</hi> your turbits are which have thrown the dark tails: you are quite right it is just the class of facts which interest me:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> —in Mayors’ time, I see that the red &amp; yellow Turbits had white tails.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I know I have your note, (but I have mislaid it) about the colour of Pigeons &amp; their down.— Will you kindly tell me briefly the fact again?<ref target="#foot.f10"/> By the way I wonder if I have any Pigeons which you want: do you want black Barbs? Just mention what you want, &amp; then I can see whether I have anything to suit.—</p>
<p>I have not yet got your Poultry Book;<ref target="#foot.f11"/> though I presume that it is lying at my Brother’s (for I have not been for a long time in London; my health having been of late very indifferent), &amp; therefore I do not know whether you describe the plumage of chickens in their down: Dixon describes most of them;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> but the chicks of Gold &amp; Silver <hi rend="underline">Pencilled</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">spangled</hi> Hamburghs are not described, &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to know them.</p>
<p>I wonder whether Fowls when crossed throw odd &amp; unexpected colours like Pigeons do.— Do you know of any such facts? For instance if you were to cross black Spanish with Black or Silver Polands, do you suppose ever red or other marked new colour would appear?—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Let me have a line about the Scanderoons; if you do not choose to have the pair to breed from; I then will try &amp; make out which is Hen, &amp; send her, &amp; I think I will kill the Cock.— Also say shall I send Borneo Fowls?</p>
<p>Pray believe me | My dear Sir | Your’s very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I have just been looking at Scanderoons, but I really fear the Hen is ill, for I think I know which is which.— The servant in charge reported 3 weeks ago (I have been from home last fortnight) that one of them looked moping, &amp; so she certainly does with wings a little drooping; &amp; that may account for the pair not having gone to nest this spring.— but I will observe more carefully during this coming week</p>
