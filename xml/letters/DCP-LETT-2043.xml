            <p>Asks WBC to plant some kidney beans [on Holy Island near Arran] and to see whether they are ever visited by bees. If no bees visit the island, it would be "curious" to observe what plants grow there.</p>

<p>Will you read the enclosed which need not be returned?<ref target="#foot.f2"/> And I beg &amp; supplicate you to direct your gardener to plant in due time on the island, of which you are sovereign Lord,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> some scarlet Kidney Beans, &amp; when you are there, move the wing-petals of several flowers, <hi rend="underline">soon</hi> after flower has opened &amp; once a second time: it will not take you five minutes to do a dozen or two flowers, &amp; see whether you do not get a crop.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Though I must confess I can hardly believe that your island is not visited occasionally by at least Humble bees. If after careful watching you really never see a Bee <hi rend="doubleUnderline">of any species</hi>, it would be eminently curious to observe what plants grow &amp; <hi rend="underline">seed</hi> freely there. For in many other plants besides Leguminosae the agency of insects is highly useful &amp; in some few cases indispensable to their fertilisation.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I hope that you will be so kind as to make the experiment on the Kidney-beans &amp; believe me dear Carpenter</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Dated by CD’s experiments on the fertilisation of kidney-beans by bees begun in the summer of 1857. In October 1857, he summarised his results for the <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle</hi> (see n. 2, below). He continued his experiments during the summer of 1858 and described them in his paper ‘On the agency of bees in the fertilization of papilionaceous flowers, and on the crossing of kidney beans’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 19–25, and letter to <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle</hi>, [before 13 November 1858]).</note>

The island, whose bay was particularly suitable for carrying out researches on marine organisms, had only one habitable cottage, half of which Carpenter rented to the Geological Survey of Great Britain for <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2486.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Henry Huxley</ref> to carry out summer fieldwork (L. Huxley ed. 1900, 1: 155).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD had performed the same experiment at Down in June 1857. The results were recorded in his Experimental book, p. 37 (DAR 157a) and published in his letter to the <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle</hi> (see n. 2, above). CD’s purpose was to imitate the action of bees moving the petals of bean flowers as they sucked at the nectar. He suggested that the movement brought about the pollination of the flowers. In his own experiments, he covered the plants with gauze to prevent the access of bees; in his letter to the <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle</hi> in 1857, he stated that it would be interesting to know whether beans ever set seed in areas where there were few or no bees (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 1: 276).</note>
