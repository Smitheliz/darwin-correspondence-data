                    <p>My sister Emma is with us &amp; I have enquired and learnt about D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin’s second wife (my grandmother), various small facts, which are worth sending.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I had myself heard them before, but they had dropped out of memory; now I recollect them.</p>
                    <p>She was an illegitimate daughter of the then Duke of Portland &amp; bore the family name of Collier, &amp; was strikingly like his legitimate children.<ref target="#foot.f2"/>  She was brought up in thoroughly good society under the charge of a lady M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Manwaring (?Mainwaring) who lived at Farnham, whom my mother knew, &amp; once visited in company with her mother (my grandmother), &amp; of whom my grandmother always spoke with great affection.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The best surviving authority is M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Harriet Bromley (your <hi rend="underline">whole</hi> cousin).<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Her mother told the story to my mother;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> (there were many other corroborations of it).</p>
                    <p>We have at last an opportunity of getting a photo of her likeness for Emma has heard this very morning from Derby (from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Woollett Wilmot)<ref target="#foot.f6"/> that the original study for the Radbarn picture of her, exists among the numerous scraps &amp; sketches made by Wright the painter, and now in possession of his great grand-daughter— It is a rough affair, partly in oil partly in water colour— We have permission to get it photographed &amp; I write by this post to order 2 for myself, one of which you shall have, (besides I have made a bid for the sketch itself.)<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>The photo of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin ordered long since at S. Kensington, has not even yet reached me—this is the picture that was in the <hi rend="underline">Loan</hi> Collection, &amp; which belongs to my sister M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Wheler.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
