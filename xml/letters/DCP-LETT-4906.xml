<p>I was just leaving Town for a few days when I received your letter<ref target="#foot.f1"/> or should have replied at once.</p>
<p>The “Reader” has no doubt changed hands, &amp; I am inclined to think for the better.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is purchased I believe by a gentleman who is a fellow of the Anthropolog. Society but I see no signs of its being made a special organ of that Soc.</p>
<p>The Editor (&amp; (I believe Prop<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.) is a Mr. Bendyshe the most talented man in the Society,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; judging from his speaking, which I have often heard, I should say the articles on “<hi rend="underline">Simeon &amp; Simony</hi>”, “<hi rend="underline">Metropolitan</hi> <hi rend="underline">Sewage</hi>” and “<hi rend="underline">France &amp; Mexico</hi>” are his, &amp; these are in my opinion superior to anything that has been in the “Reader” for a long time;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> they have the point &amp; brilliancy which are wanted to make leading articles readable &amp; popular. The articles on <hi rend="underline">Mill’s Pol. Economy</hi> &amp; on <hi rend="underline">Mazzini</hi>, are also first rate.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> He has introduced also the plan of having two &amp; now <hi rend="underline">three</hi> important articles in each number,—one Political or Social, one literary &amp; one Scientific. Under the old regime they never had an editor above mediocrity, except <hi rend="underline">Masson</hi>;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> there was a want of unity among the Prop<hi rend="superscript">trs</hi>., as to the aims &amp; objects of the Journal; &amp; there was a want of capital to secure the services of good writers.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> This seems to me to be now all changed for the better, &amp; I only hope the rumour of that <hi rend="underline">bète noir</hi> the Anthropological Soc., having any thing to do with it, may not cause our best men of science to withdraw their support &amp; contributions.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I have read <hi rend="underline">Tyler</hi> &amp; am reading <hi rend="underline">Lecky.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f9"/> I found the former somewhat disconnected, &amp; unsatisfactory from the absence of any definite result or any decided opinion on most of the matters treated of.</p>
<p>Lecky I like much, though he is rather tedious &amp; obscure at times. Most of what he says has been said so much more forcibly by <hi rend="underline">Buckle</hi> whose work I have read for the second time with increased admiration although with a clear view of some of his errors.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Nevertheless his is I think unapproachably the grandest work of the present century, &amp; the one most likely to liberalise opinion.</p>
<p>Lubbock’s book is very good, but his concluding chapter very weak.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Why are men of science so dreadfully afraid to say what they think &amp; believe?</p>
<p>In reply to your kind enquiries about myself, I can only say that I am ashamed of my own laziness. I have done nothing lately but write a paper on <hi rend="underline">Pigeons</hi> for the “Ibis”,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; am drawing up a Catalogue of my Collection of Birds.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>As to my “Travels” I cannot bring myself to undertake them yet, &amp; perhaps never shall, unless I should be fortunate enough to get a wife who would incite me thereto &amp; assist me therein,—which is not likely.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>I am glad to hear that the “Origin” is still working its <hi rend="underline">revolutionary way</hi>, on the Continent.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> Will Mueller’s book on it, be translated?<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>I am glad to hear you are a little better. My poor friend Spruce is still worse than you are, &amp; I fear now will not recover. He wants to write a book if he gets well enough.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>With best wishes Believe me | Dear Darwin | Yours very faithfully | Alfred R. Wallace <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f8">The Anthropological Society of London had been founded by James Hunt in January 1863. Hunt had been a member of the Ethnological Society of London from 1856 and joint secretary from 1860 before resigning in 1863 to found his own competing organisation. While the Ethnological Society numbered many leading Darwinians among its members, the Anthropological Society was strongly opposed to Darwinian views.

He had already published a number of bird lists based on his collection but never completed a comprehensive catalogue (see C. H. Smith ed. 1991 for a complete bibliography of Wallace’s writings). Wallace later wrote that after completing a series of papers on his collections of birds and insects, he had so many interesting areas of research to pursue that he no longer wished to spend time on the mere description of his collections (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8126.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. R. Wallace 1905</ref>, 1: 404).</note>

Spruce developed an intestinal illness while collecting <hi rend="italic">Cinchona</hi> seeds and plants in Ecuador in 1860; the illness eventually left him unable even to sit up for more than short periods of time. He continued to travel in South America for the next four years, but with ever-worsening health, before returning to England. He received a Civil List pension in 1865. In 1869, his condition improved enough for him to resume his botanical work.
