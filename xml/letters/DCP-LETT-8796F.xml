<p>I have received a multitude of letters about my Expression book, but I do not think one has contained so many valuable remarks as yours, &amp; I thank you accordingly.— I have had copied out many of your pencil observations, &amp; I return by this post your copy.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have written your name, as you desired, &amp; as you seemed to wish to have my autograph, I have added a few words; but no sooner had I done so than I became aware that I had by implication told a falsehood, as if I had presented the copy.—</p>
<p>I do not know what to think about your two cases of children “pounding” whilst sucking their tongues, for I have never seen &amp; cannot hear of infants whilst really sucking the breast thus acting. I have been particularly glad to hear about the Blushing—about the pigs’ ears (I wish I knew whether Boars with well developed tusks thus move their ears when savage)<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; about the Bull &amp; black cows; also about the rabbits. You must be a most acute &amp; careful observer, thus to have observed without your attention having been specially directed to the points in question.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>There are several points, which I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to discuss with you; but I am in truth overwhelmed with letters. With my best thanks, pray believe me yours very faithfully &amp; obliged | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>It is most gratifying to me that my Book has interested you.—</p>
<p>P.S. The youth who trembled so that he c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not reload his gun after killing his first snipe was myself, when a school-boy.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
