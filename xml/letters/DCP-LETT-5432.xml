<p>I am very much obliged for your kind present of your lecture.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> We have read it aloud with the greatest interest and I agree to every word. I admire your candour and wonderful freedom from prejudice; for I feel an inward conviction that if I had been a great classical scholar I should never have been able to have judged fairly on the subject.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> As it is, I am one of the root and branch men,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> and would leave classics to be learnt by those alone who have sufficient zeal and the high taste requisite for their appreciation. You have indeed done a great public service in speaking out so boldly. Scientific men might rail for ever, and it would only be said that they railed at what they did not understand. I was at school at Shrewsbury under a great scholar, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Butler;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I learnt absolutely nothing, except by amusing myself by reading and experimenting in chemistry.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Butler somehow found this out and publicly sneered at me before the whole school, for such gross waste of time; I remember he called me a Pococurante, which, not understanding, I thought was a dreadful name. I wish you had shown in your lecture how Science could practically be taught in a great school; I have often heard it objected that this could not be done, and I never knew what to say in answer.</p>
<p>I heartily hope that you may live to see your zeal and labour produce good fruit; and with my best thanks, I remain, my dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>

He advocated the teaching of science, as well as reforms in classical education that would eliminate verse composition and the memorisation of abstruse grammatical rules (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2459.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Farrar 1867</ref>).</note>
