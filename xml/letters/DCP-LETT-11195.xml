<p>I was very glad indeed to get your letter, for we had been daily talking about you, &amp; were anxious how your ship fared during the late tremendous gale, which has unroofed all the stacks about here.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You seem to have had a glorious expedition, &amp; I heard a few days ago from Asa Gray that you were at Cambridge, all prosperous &amp; hard at work.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It is good news that you have materials for an essay on geographical distribution.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have passed your kind words on to William about his marriage.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> We are all delighted. She is is very pleasant &amp; in all ways an excellent woman, as far as we can see.— The only drawback is that her health is not good. I have rarely seen any woman whom I have liked so much.</p>
                    <p>You ask about Litchfield: he has been fearfully ill with inflammation of the colon; for some time in extreme danger; but this is now all over, &amp; it is hoped that he may begin his journey home early next morning.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Poor old Leonard is a cripple: he sprained his knee &amp; has been on the sofa for 5 weeks &amp; may be, as far as we can see, many weeks more with not the least use of his leg.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> With crutches he can just get from room to room on the ground floor. </p>
                    <p>I suppose that you will be tremendously busy for some time to come,— what a lot of jobs you will have to clear off.</p>
                    <p>I am glad Dyer will soon have a holiday, for he looked thin when I saw him the other day.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> His kindness in aiding Frank &amp; me during your absence has been beyond all words: we have various Kew plants here, but I am sorry to say several of them have been so crucified with endless experiments that they have been much injured &amp; are hardly worth returning. Before long we will make out list of what we have got &amp; their state, &amp; then M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith or some one can decide which will be worth returning.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> We have been working like slaves, &amp; God only knows whether our results will prove worth the labour.—</p>
<p>I am glad you are back | Your affect | C. Darwin</p>
