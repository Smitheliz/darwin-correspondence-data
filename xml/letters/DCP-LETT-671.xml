                    <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
<p>I have been some time replying to your queries contained in your letter of the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Inst, but a friend of mine has had my copy of Sir E Belcher’s Narrative,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> which it was first of all necessary to procure, as the answers required some reference</p>
<p>1. <hi rend="underline">Structure of Clipperton Rock.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f2"/> Landing on the reef or rock was not deemed practicable; none therefore had a near view of it. It is a sharp, ragged rock, projecting through the coral belt.</p>
<p>2. <hi rend="underline">Cocos Island.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f3"/> This island is I believe entirely volcanic. About the existence of coral in its neighbourhood, I speak in some doubt. But my impression is that a reef was seen at a part of the island visited by one of the boats, and I think that masses of dead coral were strewed about the beach.</p>
<p>3. I never remember to have seen a bird likely to belong to Cactornis,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gould informs me there is no specimen in the collection.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">4. Increased Depth of water at Bow Island.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f6"/> I approach this subject with some caution. I know it to be Sir E. Belcher’s decided opinion that channels do deepen among coral formations, and his opinion is particularly valuable as he is a keen observer and has had the rare opportunity of seeing the same spot twice at a distant interval. But he <hi rend="underline">may</hi> be liable to a common failing of seeing according to his views. In support of his view I have heard him cite the island you mention; also the deepening of a channel at Tahiti, through which a french frigate had entered of late to the anchorage; also that the sea at Tahiti now washes over the site of a house he formerly knew well; and in these two last he I think meets with the concurrence of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Pritchard,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> our Consul there. With regard to the islet at Bow Island; its previous existence may be open to question from the circumstance that the lagoon abounds in the coral knolls, so well described in Beechey,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> many of which are awash—</p>
<p>5. <hi rend="underline">The occurrance of coral elsewhere</hi> — The Marquesas closely resemble the Society Islands, but are without their coral formations. Our experience only extended to Port Anna Maria, in Nukahiva, and a few miles of the neighbouring shores. A small coral reef exists near the anchorage, which was the only thing like coral we saw on its shores; nor was it noticed in the highlands as at the Sandwich Islands. At Vavao we saw no coral. At Amboco, Feejee Islands, a reef of coral. At New Hebrides I do not remember the least trace. Every thing here was volcanic, and in an active state.</p>
<p>I have much pleasure in answering these enquiries, but I must request you to take them with caution, as you must be well aware that the hasty visit of a ship does not permit very close examination; and my attention was never particularly drawn to the subject.</p>
<p>I am, | Yours faithfully | R<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Brinsley Hinds <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> Charles Darwin Esq</p>
