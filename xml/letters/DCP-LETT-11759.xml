            <p>Regrets he cannot compare his work with Weismann’s in his preface as he feels “an author is never a fit judge of his own work”. [Appended note explains that RM wished CD’s work to be fully acknowledged, which was frequently not the case in continental writings.]</p>

<p>I am very sorry to say that I cannot agree to your suggestion.— An author is never a fit judge of his own work, &amp; I should dislike extremely pointing out when &amp; how Weismann’s conclusions &amp; work, agreed with my own.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I feel sure that I ought not to do this, &amp; it would be to me an intolerable task. Nor does it seem to me the proper office of the Preface, which is to show what the book contains &amp; that the contents appear to me valuable. But I can see no objection for you, if you think fit, to write an introduction with remarks or criticisms of any kind. Of course I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be glad to advise you on any point as far as lay in my power, but as a whole I could have nothing to do with it, on the grounds above specified that an author cannot &amp; ought not to attempt to judge his own works or compare them with others. I am sorry to refuse to do anything which you wish.—</p>
<p>We return home early tomorrow morning— Your green silk seems to me a splendid colour, whatever the æsthetics may say—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
