<p>When I received your last letter our house was full of company, &amp; we had somebody there every day till I left home, and I always feel it quite hopeless to think of writing a letter if the house is not quite quiet.— We were all very glad to hear so good an account of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Fox.—&amp; I most sincerely hope she continues daily to gain strength.—</p>
<p>I arrived here in my most snug &amp; comfortable rooms yesterday evening, after having had a most comfortless journey up here.— I left Shrewsbury on Tuesday &amp; slept at Daventry, where I overtook my horse &amp; rode him myself the two last days journey. The poor beast was so tired that he hardly knew whether he stood on his heels or his head.—&amp; it will be some time before I undertake to ride a young horse a long journey again.— It will be very pleasant having horse up here. Moreover I think he will make a splendid hunter, from a specimen I had of him with Eytons hounds.—</p>
<p>There is not an individual up whom I know, &amp; therefore I have had plenty of time to regret your absence.— How I wish you had been able to have stayed up here. we should have suited so well, each of us reading all morning &amp; being idle all evening.— But it is not only when I am solitary that I regret your absence. Many many times do I think of our cozy breakfasts &amp; even wish for you to give me a good scolding for swearing, &amp; being out of temper or any other of my hundred faults— But is no use regretting; what cannot be altered.—</p>
<p>I have not seen Prof Henslow, but am going to a Party there to night; you have not told me half enough what you think about M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Henslow She is a devilish odd woman. I am always frightened whenever I speak to her, &amp; yet I cannot help liking her.— I suppose you cannot at all tell me what your plans are, &amp; whether there is any hope of your coming up to Cambridge.— but that of course entirely depends on your Mothers health; I trust you will write soon &amp; tell me how she is going on as it is sometime since I last heard.—</p>
<p>This is a very stupid letter, but I will try not to write many such | &amp; Believe me dear Fox | y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. sincerely. C. D—</p>
