<p>I have filled up the answers as well as I could; but it is simply impossible for me to estimate the degrees.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>My mother died during my infancy &amp; I can say hardly any thing about her.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is so impossible for any one to judge about his own character that George<ref target="#foot.f3"/> first wrote several of the answers about myself, but I have adopted only those which seem to me true.</p>
<p>You may perhaps like to hear a few additional particulars about myself. I cannot remember the time when I had not a passion for collecting, first seals, franks, then minerals, shells &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> As far as I am conscious, the one compulsory exercise during my school life which improved my intellect, was doing Euclid, &amp; this was <hi rend="underline">partly voluntary</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>At Edinburgh I do not think the lectures were of any service to me; but I profited as a naturalist by observing for myself marine animals.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>At Cambridge getting up Paley’s evidences &amp; Moral Phil. thoroughly well as I did, I felt was an admirable training, &amp; every thing else bosh.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>My education really began on board the Beagle.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I must add that my son Frank<ref target="#foot.f9"/> said he c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> safely give as my character, “sober, honest &amp; industrious.”</p>
<p>And now I want to ask you a question: if I had 50 men of 2 different nations, &amp; for some reason cd not measure all, if I picked out the 10 tallest of each nation, would their mean height probably give an approximate mean between all 50 of each nation.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I hope you will get full answers to your queries, as I dare say the results will be interesting.</p>
<p>My dear Galton | yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
<p rend="left">[Enclosure]</p>
<p>Special talents, none, except for business, as evinced by keeping accounts, being regular in correspondence, and investing money very well; very methodical in my habits. Steadiness; great curiosity about facts, and their meaning; some love of the new and marvellous.</p>
<p>Somewhat nervous temperament, energy of body shown by much activity, and whilst I had health, power of resisting fatigue. An early riser in the morning. Energy of mind shown by vigorous and long-continued work on the same subject, as 20 years on the <hi rend="underline">Origin of Species</hi> and 9 years on <hi rend="underline">Cirripedia</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Memory bad for dates or learning by rote; but good in retaining a general or vague recollection of many facts. Very studious, but not large acquirements. I think fairly independently, but I can give no instances. I gave up common religious belief almost independently from my own reflections. I suppose that I have shown originality in science, as I have made discoveries with regard to common objects. Liberal or radical in politics. Health good when young—bad for the last 33 years.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Father</hi>. Practical business habits; made a large fortune and incurred no losses.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Strong social affection and great sympathy with the pleasures of others; sceptical as to new things; curious as to facts; great foresight; not much public spirit; great generosity in giving away money and assistance. Freethinker in religious matters, great power of endurance.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mother</hi>. Said to have been very agreeable in conversation.</p>
