<p>I received a week ago your letter of June 2. full as usual of valuable matter &amp; specimens.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It arrived at exactly the right time, for I had just completed, &amp; was enabled to correct a pretty full abstract of your observations on the plant’s own pollen being poisonous. I have inserted this abstract in the proof sheets in my chapter on sterility, &amp; it forms the most striking part of my whole chapter.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I thank you very sincerely for these most interesting observations, which however I regret that you did not publish independently. I have been forced to abbreviate one or two parts more than I wished—viz. about the fertility of the Epidendreae &amp; on the advantage to the plant of the pollen being poisonous, for I was not quite sure that I understood parts of your letter.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The seeds which you have sent are very valuable.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Your letters always surprize me from the number of points to which you attend. I wish I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> make my letters of any interest to you, for I hardly ever see a naturalist &amp; live as retired a life as you in Brazil. The terrestrial Orchis with the pollen-staff seems very curious; my first impression was that it was allied to Spiranthes. With respect to mimetic plants I remember Hooker many years ago saying he believed that there were many, but I agree with you that it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be most difficult to distinguish between mimetic resemblance &amp; the effects of peculiar conditions.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Who can say to which of these causes to attribute the several plants with heath-Erica-like foliage at the C. of Good Hope?<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Is it not also a difficulty that quadrupeds appear to recognize plants more by their odour than their appearance? What I have just said reminds me to ask you a question: Sir J. Lubbock brought me the other day what appears to be a terrestrial planaria (the first ever found in the northern hemisphere) &amp; which was coloured exactly like our dark coloured <hi rend="underline">slugs</hi>. Now slugs are not devoured by birds like the shell-bearing species, &amp; this made me remember that I found the Brazilian planariæ actually together with striped Vaginuli which I believe were similarly coloured.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Can you throw any light on this? I wish to know, because I was puzzled some months ago how it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be possible to account for the bright colours of the planariæ in reference to sexual selection. By the way I suppose they are Hermaphrodites?<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Do not forget to aid me, if in y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> power, with answers to <hi rend="doubleUnderline">any</hi> of my questions on expression, for the subject interests me greatly.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>with cordial thanks for y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> never failing kindness | believe me yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
