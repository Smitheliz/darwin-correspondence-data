<p>I send you on a slip of glass pollen grains as well as I can get them of Rhamnus <hi rend="underline">Frangula</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am afraid you will hardly find a decent grain among the long pistilled, but I send them as I have no eye piece micrometer,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; I may not be able to get any more flowers; I do not think there is anything in it.</p>
<p>This is what I put down when I examined some shrubs— “Aug 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> examined sprigs from 12 trees of Rh. Frangula, the average length of pistil just beneath the base of stamens; but taking casually 1 flower from each sprig, 6 appeared to have rather longer pistils than the others, &amp; of the 6 short ones, (perhaps 2) one was decidedly smaller in size &amp; in length of style; &amp; though not aborted, (as ovules could be detected in ovary), appeared on the way to abortion. This division of the flowers into 6 &amp; 6 apparently fell to pieces, as on examining the bundles of sprigs divided according to length of pistils, small variations in length of pistil were found in them.</p>
<p>Aug 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. again examined remaining flowers on twigs and think it mere variety—it would take many more trees to decide—flowers appear to vary in size on different shrubs when there is little appreciable difference in length of pistil—all bear fruit equally well &amp; profusely”.— I do not know if you will make out the patches of pollen,—that <hi rend="underline">nearest the red paint</hi> is short pistilled</p>

<p>I perhaps may manage to get some flowers but they are fast disappearing</p>
