            <p>Exchanges news on health.</p>
            <p>Thanks AR for his worm observations.</p>
            <p>George Darwin’s work is attracting attention; he intends to try for Plumian Professorship at Cambridge. Adds other news of George and of CD’s sons Leonard and William.</p>
            <p>CD has finished his microscopic work and has only to write up two papers for the Linnean Society.</p>

                    <p>It is always a pleasure to me to receive a letter from you. I am very sorry to hear that you have been more troubled than usual with your old complaint.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Anyone who looked at you would think that you had passed through life with few evils, &amp; yet you have had an unusual amount of suffering. As a turnkey remarked in one of Dickens’ novels “Life is a rum thing”.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> As for myself I have been better than usual until about a fortnight ago, when I had a cough, &amp; this pulled me down &amp; made me miserable to a strange degree; but my dear old wife insisted on my taking Quinine, &amp; though I have very little faith in medicine, this, I think, has done me much good.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Well we are both so old that we must expect some troubles: I shall be 73 on Feb. 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.</p>
<p>I have been glad to hear about the pine-leaves &amp; you are the first man who has confirmed my account that they are drawn in by the base with a very few exceptions.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> With respect to your Wandsworth case I think that if I had heard of it, before publishing, I would have said nothing about the ledges; for the Grisedale case, mentioned in my book &amp; observed whilst I was correcting the proof-sheets, made me feel rather doubtful. Yet the Corniche case shows the worms at least aid in making the ledges. Nevertheless I wish I had said nothing about the confounded ledges.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The success of this worm-book has been almost laughable. I have, however, been plagued with an endless stream of letters on the subject; most of them very foolish &amp; enthusiastic, but some containing good fact, which I have used in correcting yesterday the “Sixth Thousandth”.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Your friend George’s work about the viscous state of the earth &amp; tides &amp; the moon has lately been attracting much attention, &amp; all the great judges think highly of the work.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> He intends to try for the Plumian Professorship of Mathematicks &amp; Nat. Philosophy at Cambridge, which is a good &amp; honourable post of about 800<hi rend="superscript">£</hi> a year. I think that he will get it, when Challis is dead &amp; he is very near his end; but G. says he does not care much about it, as it will interfere with his own original work.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> He has all the great men Sir W. Thompson, Adams, Stokes &amp;c on his side.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> He has lately been chief examiner for the mathematical Tripos, which was tremendous work; &amp; the day before yesterday he started from Southampton for a 5 weeks tour to Jamaica for complete rest to see the Blue Mountains &amp; escape the rigour of the early spring.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I believe that George will some day be a great scientific swell.</p>
<p>The war-office has just offered Leonard a post in the Government survey at Southampton &amp; very civilly told him to go down &amp; inspect the place &amp; accept or not as he liked. So he went down, but has decided that it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not be worth his while to accept, as it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. entail his giving up his expedition (on which he had been ordered) to Queensland in Australia to observe the Transit of Venus.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Dear old William at Southampton has not been very well, but is now better. He has had too much work—a willing horse is always overworked—&amp; all the arrangements for receiving the Brit. Assoc. there this summer have been thrown on his shoulders, other idle men having shirked the work.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> But good Heavens, what a deal I have written about my sons. I have had some hard work this autumn with the microscope; but this is over, &amp; I have only to write out two papers for Linnean Society.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> We have had a good many visitors; but none who w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have interested you, except probably M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Ritchie, the daughter of Thackeray, who is a most amusing &amp; pleasant person.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>I have not seen Huxley for some time, but my wife heard this morning from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley, who wrote from her bed, with a bad account of herself &amp; of several of her children; but none I hope are at all dangerously ill.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> Farewell my kind good friend— Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>Many thanks about the picture, which if I survive you &amp; this I do not expect, shall be hung in my study as a perpetual memento of you.—<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
