<p>Enclosed is the answer to your query: when complete the work will consist, I believe, of 6 numbers, lately only 4 were published.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I am glad to hear that you have been lecturing, as a sign, I trust, that you have been pretty well.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Your “Museum Notices” if published, would, I should think, make a complete Encyclopædia of all the Sciences!</p>
<p>Have you seen Hooker’s book<ref target="#foot.f3"/> yet: it is most beautifully got up &amp; illustrated, &amp; I feel greatly honoured &amp; very <hi rend="underline">much gratified</hi> at the wonderful compliment of its dedication to me.— I have read about a hundred pages, &amp; like it very much.—</p>
<p>I saw a letter a few days ago from Lyell from Madeira:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> he was enjoying the scenery &amp; geology beyond measure &amp; was going to start in a few days for Teneriffe.— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Bunbury has profited in health wonderfully from her voyage, &amp; been better than she has been for years.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Do, I most heartily beg you, keep to your proposal of paying us a visit on your return from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Jenyn’s.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; we will go to the Crystal Palace.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>We could send to Edenbridge Station (eleven miles) to meet you, sleep here, &amp; go next day or next day but one to the Palace; &amp; thus the great rectangle which the S.E. Railway makes, would be cut off.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>My dear Henslow, I most sincerely hope that you are well.— | Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Frances Bunbury had had a severe illness in September 1852 from which she made only a slow recovery. Initially, while the others toured Madeira on horseback, she was conveyed in a ‘hammock slung to a pole, and carried by two men’. By 27 January 1854, however, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_722.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles James Fox Bunbury</ref> reported that ‘Fanny is delightfully well and strong, full of spirit, “up to anything,” is on horseback for several hours a day, and quite a different creature from what she was a year ago. She has made a great number of very characteristic and accurate sketches … and she is indefatigable in making and calculating barometrical observations for <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref>.’ (F. J.

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The Crystal Palace, main hall of the Great Exhibition of 1851, was re-erected in Sydenham, Kent, in 1854.

To pick up Henslow at Edenbridge, south of Bromley, and then drop him off at Sydenham, the site of the Crystal Palace, would cut the corner off the railway journey between these points.</note>
