<p>Please read the enclosed &amp; return them.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> If you will let me know what answer to give to Zacharias I will write. I am much surprized to hear that any publisher will publish it.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Would it be impertinent to tell him to pocket any profits,—it is so excessively improbable that there will be any.? Jevons’ letter is very pleasing to me &amp; encourages me to believe that I perhaps may do something health notwithstanding.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have just finished an account of the Globes for the Philosoph. Mag., &amp; I hope they will put it in, as it has never appeared anywhere yet.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> It took me rather longer than I expected to draw the figures &amp; write it.</p>
<p>I have always been in the habit of going in very late to hall so as to escape a sit of 25 min. before I get anything to eat, but 3 of the very dullest men the world has seen have just taken their M.A’s &amp; come to our table &amp; always sit at the bottom so that I have been cut off from human intercourse for 4 or 5 days— So last night I thought it better to try the waiting dodge, &amp; I shall pretty often in future as the other is very depressing.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I was repaid last night by meeting a very pleasant American Prof. Gilman, who has come to Europe to get hints about Universities. He is to be president of a new Univ. at Baltimore to wh. some one has given <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> million doll<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> He had met Leo. in S. Francisco, &amp; knew the Nortons well tho’ not a Bostonian.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> How small the world is! Tell Horace that Rendal has got a fellowship.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> We have just reelected Cayley w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. is a good thing, as his professional stipend is not very high.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I received a pamphlet from Germany this A.M<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Doctor G. H. D Esq.</p>
<p>Our titles seem an endless mystery to foreigners.</p>
<p>I had hardly written the other day when the sickness began again, tho’ not very bad; but today I am too unwell to do anything except write letters. It is the usual bilious business.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I do not expect wine abstinence will do much for me. At times I feel an intense desire for something strong tasting &amp; eat salt to satisfy it, but I suppose it is the wine I want; however I shall persevere for my month &amp; certainly my average for the last 10 days has been very much higher.</p>
<p>I’m afraid my pitch experiments must wait again for a few days, as it requires making observations every 5 min. for a long time together.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have had one short turn at it &amp; find it very difficult as one has to look at a watch &amp; observe an index at same time. I almost think I shall have to get a chronometer &amp; someone to help me, but I shall persevere without for a time &amp; see whether it is likely to lead to any results. It will require hundreds of observations &amp; each of them requires several hours preparation because I must get the pitch to a given temperature thro’out before I can begin.</p>
<p>The fear haunts me that it won’t be of any value when I do get my results. However after a month or two, if I can work, I shall begin to see my way</p>
