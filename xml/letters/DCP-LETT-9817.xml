            <p>Is alarmed by the petitions against vivisection that are being circulated. Believes there is scope for reasonable legislation and would like to see eminent physiologists prepare a petition so that the science could be protected and animals saved from needless suffering.</p>

<p>I received some time ago a foolish paper from Miss Cobbe about vivisection which I did not sign, &amp; this morning I have received a duplicate asking for my signature, which I shall refuse.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But I see the paper is now signed by many powerful names, including some doctors.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is to be presented to the House of Lords by the Archbishop of York—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> No doubt you have seen the papers, otherwise I would lend them to you. Other papers are likewise in circulation, &amp; from what I see of their effect on sensible &amp; independant people (eg my brother &amp; the Litchfields),<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I fully believe that the House of Commons, being thoroughly unscientific, will pass some stringent law, enough to check or quite stop the revival of Physiology in this country. I am sure you will agree with me that this will be a great misfortune. A pamphlet by Miss Cobbe also makes me think (though the evidence is not quite sufficient) that many demonstrated truths causing great suffering are uselessly repeated;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; I have reason to believe that experiments are made on animals without the use of anaesthetics, when they could be used, &amp; this I look at as simply atrocious. Though the promoters of the present movement are flagratly unjust towards physiologists, this is no reason why they and all biologists should not do what can be done to save suffering. I think that if they were to present a petition to the House of Commons, signed by eminent physiologists &amp; biologists, praying for reasonable legislation on the subject,—they would not only do direct good, but this would be by far the best way to counteract the passionate appeals of the promoters of the present movement. You know the report of B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Assoc<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> at Liverpool (1870) signed by B. Sanderson, Flower, Humphry &amp; others.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> This I should think would be an excellent model, &amp; I for one should rejoice to sign a petition to the House that this Report should be enforced as far as possible by Law. Regulations known to be passed in conformity with the judgement of eminent physiologists could hardly fail to have at least a moral effect in all Physiological Laboratories in England; &amp; this would be a grand result, I am sure that you will forgive me for troubling you on this subject on the chance of my doing any good. As you live in London &amp; see other Physiologists you could easily gather whether they take at all the same view of the subject as I do. If nothing is done I look at the noble science of Physiology as doomed to death in this country. This letter is very badly expressed but I hope is intelligible.</p>
