                    <p>I am truly pleased that you have found interest in the old Book, &amp; pray do not hurry to return it. I only hope that your son may also derive pleasure from it—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The absurd verses about the Hare Hunt show us, at least, that our grandfather was not the first poet in the family! that his Brother John stammered, &amp; that, beautiful as was his handwriting in his old age, (see his letter to my grandmother) he was, in his youth, sadly deficient both in his writing &amp; in his spelling!—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I cannot help you as to the Jockey story. I have often heard my Father tell it; but when it happened, &amp; who the gentleman was, who owned the Horse that was to lose, I have no recollection—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I do not know whether D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D went to Edinburgh when Charles died: but I have this day found amongst my Fathers papers the scrap which I enclose. It is in my Father’s writing, &amp; from it I should collect, as you probably will, that, knowing that his Father could never see his son again, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duncan, or some loving friend, had the picture taken—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have no means of seeing the life of Sir H Rayburn.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Duncans vault, or burying place, when I saw it in 1840, was, like many others in Edinburgh &amp; the neighbourhood before the “Anatomy Act”, an inclosure strongly railed in with Iron Rails, &amp; the tablet to Charles was against the wall facing you—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> If you require an engraving of our Grandfather I may be able to help you, as I have the picture by Wright of Derby, mentioned in Miss Sewards life of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D. page 21, painted about 1770, when he would be under 40; &amp; after waiting many years I have obtained the little engraving of the picture size 3 inches by 4—engraved by J. A. Wedgwood.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I only know of two other copies—probably however you may have one.</p>
                    <p>I have also the picture by Rawlinson painted about 1800, &amp; the engraving of it—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have but few articles which belonged to our Grandfather— the chair in which he always sat in his Library— His Library ladder, which shuts up into a plain pole, &amp; which he invented— His Cheese Scoop, &amp; Apple scoop, (made of Bone) which he always used—his silver repeater watch, &amp; his two seals, one “E. D.” &amp; the other, the one I have used for years with his adopted motto, &amp; which motto I manage to avoid.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
                    <p>Do you possess a small book printed for private circulation in 1859, “Sketch of the life of James Keir?”. It was sent me by the compiler, James Moilliet, &amp; contains<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
