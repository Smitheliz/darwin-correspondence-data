<p>Your last account,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> some months ago, was so little satisfactory, that I have often been thinking of you, &amp; should be really obliged if you would fly me a few lines, &amp; tell me how your voice &amp; chest are. I most sincerely hope that your report will be good; this wonderfully mild winter must be in your favour.</p>
<p>As for myself I really have no news: just lately my stomach has been a little extra ailing.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> All other members of the family are flourishing. My eldest Boy is now home from Rugby: he is a thoroughily steady, industrious &amp; good boy; I fancy, (though perhaps it is fancy) that I see the contracting effects on his mind of his very steady attention to classics: formerly I think he had more extended interests, &amp; cared more for the causes &amp; reasons of things.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Our second lad Georgie, has a strong mechanical turn: &amp; we think of making him an engineer: I shall try &amp; find out for him some less classical school,—perhaps Bruce Castle.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I certainly sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to see more diversity in Education, than there is any ordinary school: no exercise of the observing or reasoning faculties,—no general knowledge acquired,—I must think it a wretched system: on the other hand a Boy who has learnt to stick at Latin &amp; conquer its difficulties, ought to be able to stick at any labour.— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. always be glad to hear anything about schools or education from you.</p>
<p>I am at my old, never-ending subject, but trust I shall really go to press in a few months with my second volume on Cirripedes:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have been much pleased by finding some odd facts in my 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. vol. believed by Owen, &amp; a few others, whose good opinion I regard as final.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have this morning been dissecting a most abnormal cirripede, which after a good meal has to vomit forth the residuum, for there is no other exit!<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I heard yesterday from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker, who married Henslow’s eldest daughter, of the birth of a son<ref target="#foot.f8"/> under Chloroform, at Hitcham.</p>
<p>I wonder when we shall see you here again: it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. give Emma &amp; myself no common pleasure. Do write pretty soon &amp; tell me all you can about yourself—&amp; family &amp; I trust your Report of yourself may be much better than your last.</p>
<p>Catherine &amp; Susan are at present staying with Erasmus in London, &amp; perhaps I shall go up &amp; see them next week.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have been very little in London of late, &amp; have not seen Lyell since his return from America: how lucky he was to exhume with his own hand parts of 3 skeletons of Reptiles out of the <hi rend="underline">Carboniferous</hi> strata, &amp; out of the inside of a fossil tree, which had been hollow within!<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
