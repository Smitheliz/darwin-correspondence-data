<p>Everything has gone on prosperously.— Emma seems to like the place &amp; Doddy was in ectasies for two whole days.— Weather been very good &amp; I have stood work perfectly. Tomorrow I go— I am very busy today.— Will you ask my Father to listen to my letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cockell, who is the surgeon of Down.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> He introduced himself to me.— I have been able through M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cresy to hear good character of him from a Physician, who formerly saw much of him— I do not like his manners, but upon deliberation we have determined it will be best employ him.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He is only two fields off.— I do not much like my own letter &amp; should be much obliged for any suggestions, when it is returned.— Emma suggested my putting in about increased terms, afraid he should he think my plan was only for œconomy.—</p>
<p>Our address is simply “Down Kent”.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blunt’s bill is come &amp; is only £8 ’ 13 ’ 11!!!— I have written to thank him.— Will my Father be so kind as to add this to other items &amp; I will ask for no more?— I think I shall get through (thanks to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>) pretty well.— I forget whether I told my Father I gave 1£ to Mark.— he did not require any other money.— I paid expences to Down with an additional trifle for him.—</p>
<p>I ought to have said that Mr Cockell introduced himself to me, so I begin</p>
<p>Dear Sir.—</p>
<p>Can you let me know sometime when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Haycock is likely to go to town; as he has offered, to speak to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cresy about remuneration for his trouble.—</p>
<p>I have not had time to call on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hine,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but have written apologies for not having done so— I shall see him when the deeds are conveyed.—</p>
<p>I think I have been very lucky in my horse &amp; carriage: the whole has cost about 100 guineas.—</p>
<p>I long for tomorrow. I feel sure I shall become deeply attached to Down, with a few improvements— It will be very difficult not to be very extravagant there— I hope Susan will be able to arrange her visit. My Father will better feel, as if he had seen it.</p>
<p>Goodbye. Excuse this dull business, too like all my late ones.</p>
<p>C. D.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Blunt has sent me a classified list of my medicines, I should be very much obliged if it would not be giving too much trouble to my Father, if either of you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> sometime read it over to him &amp; in that case I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> send it, &amp; with pen write opposite each ordinary dose for child of 18 months old, so that we might give little less or more according to child’s age.— Is there any ordinary rule of proportion in doses between an 18 months old child &amp; a grown up person?—</p>
