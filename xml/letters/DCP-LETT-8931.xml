<p>The Natural Philosophical Society [Academy of Sciences] will publish his translation of <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> in August, before <hi rend="italic">Descent</hi>.</p> 
            <p>A distinguished member of the Hungarian Parliament attacked CD’s theory. LD answered, and a controversy ensued.</p>
            <p>LD has noted many signs of public support for CD.</p>

<p>As I had the honour to mention you that I intend to translate the Descents of Man,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> the natural philosophical society accepted my proposal: to translate the most conspicious foreign authors on the hungarian language, and for the first instance the society received after my own motion to publish first of all The Origin of Species,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> and only after that the Descent of Man, and I was commited with the translation, and the first volume of it schall be publisched in August, and the second part, from the Chapter VIII at the end of the year.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It is very elegantly printed, and we shall have the honour to present to you one copy of it when quite ready.</p>
<p>We should to publisch your portrait too on the head of the translation, therefore we should be much obliged to have some information where to get some authentic electrotype copies? If you could be so kind to direct your publisher to let me know the terms how to get them, but very speedily, we should order them.</p>
<p>For the last winter session of the hungarian parliament a very conspicious member of it, Mr Paul Somsich on an occasion attacked your whole theory.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Because he was in the last year president of the parliament, and now very influential member of the Right, I answered to him publicly in the “Reform” (: one of the the largest hungarian newspaper:)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> very severly attacking him again for his groundless assertion, and he answerd to me also publicly, recalling his former assertion,—and in all this it is the most interesting to me, that the public with many sign of sympathi have receaved me for your defence;— it is therefore not to be doubted that the Origin of Species shall exercise great influence here. I was last summer in Scandinavia, but as I have experienced it of many side, they are yet afraid of it!</p>
<p>With my greatest and sincere respect I remain | Dear Sir! | truly yours | L. Dapsy &amp;c</p>
