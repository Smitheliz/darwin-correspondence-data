<p>Since the first formation of “The Home” seventy one cases have been received from the Prisons of East and West Kent, of whom fifty-three have been satisfactorily dealt with.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Notwithstanding this success, it has been found that a small establishment is proportionately very expensive, and that the Home, while benefiting the class of female domestic servants only, did not enlist that general sympathy and support which could alone ensure its permanence.</p>
                    <p>It was therefore unanimously resolved at the last Annual General Meeting of the Subscribers, that the present Home should be closed, and that the Association should be 〈<hi rend="italic">about a third of a page missing</hi>〉 the reception of s 〈    〉〈<hi rend="italic">5 or 6 words</hi>〉 may deem fit objects for its inter〈    〉 〈<hi rend="italic">2 or 3 words</hi>〉</p>
                    <p>It has been calculated that 〈<hi rend="italic">3 or 4 words</hi>〉 are annually discharged from the Gaols of 〈<hi rend="italic">2 or 3 words</hi>〉 of whom a considerable percentage might be res〈    〉 〈<hi rend="italic">1 or 2 words</hi>〉 means of admission to such Refuges, Homes, or penitentiaries, or by assisting them to emigrate:—</p>
<p>Owing to a deficiency caused by the fitting up of the laundry at the late Home, and by the expense of transferring its inmates to another Refuge, the Society is now burdened with a debt. We beg respectfully to ask you to co-operate with us by a donation in paying this off at once, so that the Society’s means of usefulness may not be crippled during the present year.—</p>
<p>We wish also earnestly to solicit an annual subscription toward this most important work, not only on the ground of philanthropy, but also on that of sound social economy.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>

St Mary’s Home, or the Kent Penitentiary, moved from Tenterden, Kent, to Stone, Kent, in the first half of 1866 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5897.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Nokes 1895</ref>, p. 27). CD made a payment of £1 10<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> to ‘Book hawk &amp; Kent penitents’ on 21 February 1866, and thereafter usually recorded an annual donation of £1 or more to what he variously described as ‘Church. Eng. Pen. Soc.’, ‘Kent Female Pen.’, and ‘Kent Penitent’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Other means of earning money having failed, a laundry was set up at the penitentiary in Tenterden, and in 1866 earned £40 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5897.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Nokes 1895</ref>, pp. 19–20).</note>
