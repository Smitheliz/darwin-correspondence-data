                    <p>I must copy out a few lines from a poem (an imitation of Horace) addressed to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D. by his friend Sir Brooke Boothby because they are an eloquent testimony to his kindness of heart.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>〈<hi rend="italic">7 lines excised</hi>〉</p>
                    <p>This is printed in Boothby’s “Sorrows”— also the following Sonnet</p>
                    <quote type="verse"><p>Darwin! had mortal science e’er availed </p><p>To save from Fate’s irrevocable doom; </p><p>Death had not cropped the pride of beauty’s bloom </p><p>Nor I my loss with ceaseless tears bewailed— </p><lb/>
                        <p>When the last efforts of thy art had failed </p><p>And all my thoughts were wedded to the tomb </p><p>Thy mild philosophy repelled the gloom </p><p>And bade me bear the ills on life entailed— </p><p>Not with vain precepts, which th’unwounded breast </p><p>Dictates, at ease, to sufferings never known, </p><p>But lenient charms, that calm’d thy soul to rest </p><p>When the dire pangs I felt were once thine own, </p><p>“That she from woes like mine was ta’en away </p><p>And few the sorrowing days I here shall stay <ref target="#foot.f3"/></p></quote>
                    <p>This kindness is exemplified also in Wright’s great picture of the “Air Pump”, now in the S. Kensington Mus:. The wise men are intent on their experiments, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Whitehurst is exhausting the receiver, a child hides her face from the pigeon’s distressing fate—&amp; it is <hi rend="underline">D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.

                    <p>It is curious that Miss Sewards sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be the only biography we have.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I know nothing more wonderful than the <hi rend="underline">variety</hi> of his genius. Many would have been bewildered by such a compound gift, and in trying everything, w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have done nothing, but he made his mark in all that he undertook, and his great closely printed Quartos show an almost superhuman energy, written as they were during such a medical career—&amp; he combined with all this learning &amp; labour an uncommon fund of wit—and a great fondness and aptitude for society.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>I shall post this today, but shall not be able to forward the books till tomorrow, for it is a <hi rend="underline">pouring day</hi>, and I live some distance from the R<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. Office.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The view of the Priory is compressed into the size you sent me—and will be very nice when finished &amp; printed.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Believe me | yours very truly | Violetta H Darwin.</p>
                    <p>I think that in the Sonnet, where Sir B. B refers to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D’s own experience of sorrow, he must be alluding to the death of his son Charles— the dates bear this out. and we know of no other great sorrow of his—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

The poem suggests that <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1219.xml">Erasmus Darwin</ref> treated Boothby’s daughter and it also expands on his regard for the poor as a doctor.
