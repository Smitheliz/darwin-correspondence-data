<p>I am sorry to have to send you intelligence which I know will cause you regret. Ten days ago our friend Chauncey Wright died suddenly, apparently without suffering, from congestion of the brain.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>He was found in the morning seated at his desk in an easy attitude, unconscious, but still breathing. He died in a few minutes. He had apparently not been in bed during the night, but had been writing. He was busy with an article on your last book,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> which lay open beside him. A week before I had brought down to him from Ashfield a box full of specimens of Drosera which my little girl Sally, knowing his interest in the plant, had secured for him.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The last letter any of us had from him was a pleasant note to Sally telling her what he had been observing of the habits of the Sundew.</p>
<p>He had stayed with us here for more than a week in August, and had seemed uncommonly well. The last time I saw him was about ten days before his death at Cambridge, when he came to read me the proof of his article in the “Nation” on “German Darwinism,” and to tell me of some changes which he proposed to make in this essay which he had read to me in manuscript some time before.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I was particularly struck with his animation and his cheerfulness, and with his readiness to be interested in other subjects than that which for the time was chiefly occupying his thought.</p>
<p>I believe that he had contemplated the probability of such a death as it was his good fortune to die by. He had no shrinking from death, and no desire to die. He was far too much of a philosopher to form wishes about life or death. And, so far as he is concerned, there is no reason to regret his death. The prospect of his life was not unclouded. But to his friends his death is an irreparable, lifelong loss. The vigour of his intelligence was not more remarkable than the sweetness of his heart, and the simplicity of his whole nature. The clearness and power of his mind were plain in his work, but only those who knew him most intimately could know how wise and trustworthy his judgment was, not only in matters of philosophy but also in those of practical life, or how generously his wisdom was put at the service of all who sought help from him.</p>
<p>His death, following so soon on that of Wyman,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> is a great blow, not merely to Cambridge, but to the interests of sound thought and scientific inquiry throughout the country. But he was not widely known, and there are but few persons who will know what a great loss we have suffered …</p>
<p>P.S. I ought, perhaps, to add that besides Wright’s interest as a scientific man in your work, he had a strong moral and personal interest in it. Your work was the illustration and exhibition of the spirit which he sought in scientific enquiry. I think that in his late years, he had no greater gratification than the recognition you gave to his work, and the occasional receipt of a letter or note from you.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> He was radically modest, but he was pleased with your expression of interest in or approval of what he wrote. His visit to you was the most prized experience of his stay in Europe, and from that time his feeling toward you was one in which a certain shy affection gave a still deeper character to the complete respect he had long cherished.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
