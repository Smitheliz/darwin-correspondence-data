<p>In your letter to Holden you are pleased to observe, “that of all the blackguards you ever met with I am the greatest”: Upon this observation I shall make no remark, excepting that I must give you all due credit for acting on it most rigidly: And now I should like know, in what one particular are you less of Blackguard than I am? You idle old wretch why have you not answered my last letter which I am sure I forwarded to Clifton nearly 3 weeks ago? If I was not really very anxious to hear what you are doing: I should have allowed you to remain till you thought it worth while to treat me like a gentleman.—</p>
<p>And now having vented my spleen in scolding you, &amp; having told you, what you must know, how very much &amp; how anxiously I want to hear how you &amp; your family are getting on at Clifton, the purport of this letter is finished. If you did but know how often I think of you &amp; how often I regret your absence, I am sure I should have heard from you long enough ago: I find Cambridge rather stupid, &amp; as I know scarcely any one that walks, &amp; this joined with my lips not being quite so well, has reduced me to sort of Hybernation, which almost equals “poor little Whitmores” melancholy case.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Old Whitley has begun to take your place, &amp; we have just commenced a regular series of constitutionals.—</p>
<p>Entomology goes on but poorly: a few Dromius &amp; Agonum’s, together with the Pæcilus (with red thighs) make the g〈reat〉 part of what I have collected this ter〈m〉. I have caught M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Harbour letting Babington<ref target="#foot.f2"/> have the first pick of the beettles; accordingly we have made our final adieus, my part in the affecting scene consisted in telling him he was a d——d rascal, &amp; signifying I should kick him down the stairs if ever he appeared in my rooms again: it seemed altogether mightily to surprise the young gentleman.—</p>
<p>I have no news to tell you, indeed, when a correspondence has been broken off like ours has been, it is difficult to make the first start again.— Last night there was a terrible fire at Linton eleven miles from Cambridge; seeing the reflection so plainly in sky, Hall,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Woodyeare<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Turner<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; myself thought we would ride &amp; see it we set out at 1/2 after 9, &amp; rode like incarnate devils there, &amp; did not return till 2 in the morning. altogether it was a most awful sight.—</p>
<p>I cannot conclude, without telling you, “that of all the blackguards I ever met with, you are y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> greatest &amp; the best | C Darwin.—</p>
<p>1 o’clock—going on very well</p>
