                    <p>Semper seems much pleased about the machine &amp; has written me an uncommonly nice letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The machine has just started for London to be cleaned, packed, &amp; despatched to Würzburg.—</p>
                    <p>Thanks for your last long letter, all of which I have enjoyed much, but you must not waste time by writing again—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am glad to hear about the sleep of the Leguminosæ, but you seem to find little else in any other Families.— My Porliera has never been watered &amp; the earth seems as dry as dust, but the leaves are still awake in the day.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>It rejoices me to hear that you are working at my old friends the twiners: how I did enjoy the work, but how much better I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have done it now; for I rarely then made tracings.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It is quite new to me about the supplementary little circles of Cobæa, &amp; it throws light on what I have often noticed of late in the circumnutation of <hi rend="underline">non-climbing</hi> plants.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>I think that De Vries has proved that there is increased growth along one side of tendril where it curls up spirally.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>The Helvingia is a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">most curious</hi> case, &amp; I am particularly glad that you will observe it, &amp; you are a good fellow, for I know that you hate bloom.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
                    <p>I am sorry Sachs is so severe on men, as that is a character which I dislike: by Jove the Moscow man (Mery……?) returned the compliment in his last paper.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
                    <p>Since I wrote last I found old note by Dyer about mould turning to light, &amp; I must modify the rough notion which I wrote to you; but I think that I can “wriggle” out.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> If you possibly can find out from Sachs whether any moulds are apheliotropic, &amp; whether any roots are apheliotropic or are they all heliotropic.</p>
<p>Subterranean roots are the most perplexing.—</p>
                    <p>Hooker is going to hunt up &amp; send me heliotropic aërial roots.— Hooker was very nice when here, though hot about Turkey.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
                    <p>I am working hard at peduncles of <hi rend="underline">Trifolium subterraneum</hi>, which buries its flower-head, after flowers are fertilised; there seems much odd about whole case.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Yours affect<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. C. Darwin</p>
                    <p>(I do not understand movements of Adenanthera)<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
                    <p>Say to Sachs how proud I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be to see him at Down, if he can spare time &amp; if we are at home.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Francis had reported that the leaves of a <hi rend="italic">Porlieria</hi> planted in the ground in the Würzburg garden were tightly closed (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11623.xml">letter from Francis Darwin, [21 July 1878]</ref> and n. 10). CD’s observations were made on a plant he had borrowed from Kew (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11593.xml">letter to Francis Darwin, 6 [July 1878]</ref>). Leguminosae (a synonym of Fabaceae) is the family of peas and beans; CD wanted to find sleeping plants from other families (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11608.xml">letter to Francis Darwin, 14 July [1878]</ref> and n. 2). </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD carried out numerous experiments on climbing plants in 1863 and 1864. His  paper, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Climbing plants’</ref>, was read before the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> on 2 February 1865 and appeared in book form (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1457.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Climbing plants</hi></ref>) in the same year; a second edition was published in 1875 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1457.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Climbing plants</hi></ref> 2d ed).

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Francis had made tracings showing the circumnutation of a tendril of an unnamed species of <hi rend="italic">Cobaea</hi>; the tendril made both a broad sweeping movement and several small spiral movements within a given time period (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11623.xml">letter from Francis Darwin, [21 July 1878]</ref> and n. 4). CD concluded that the great sweeps made by twining stems or tendrils were a modified form of ordinary circumnutation but with greatly increased amplitude (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5637.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Movement in plants</hi></ref>, p. 3).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Francis mentioned he wanted to read <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4908.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hugo de Vries’s</ref> work on the mechanics of bending in climbing plants (see  <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11623.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Francis Darwin, [21 July 1878]</ref> and n. 6). De Vries had studied the relation between between growth and bending (Vries 1873a and 1873b); he later showed that growth was a secondary effect, and that the curvature was produced by increased turgescence of the cells on the convex side (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5637.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Movement in plants</hi></ref>, p. 2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4143.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Julius Sachs</ref> had shown Francis fruits of <hi rend="italic">Helvingia rusciflora</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Helwingia japonica</hi>). Francis noted that flowers were full of juice and covered with bloom and planned to investigate whether the bloom served to protect the petals from moisture (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11623.xml">letter from Francis Darwin, [21 July 1878]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Kliment Arkady Timiryazev of Moscow, in his paper ‘Sur la décomposition de l’acide carbonique dans le spectre solaire, par les parties vertes des végétaux’ (On the decomposition of carbonic acid in the solar spectrum, by the green parts of plants; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10641.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Timiriazeff 1877</ref>, pp. 382, 395), suggested that Sachs’s belief that the light rays that produced the maximum decomposition could be determined was based on Sachs’s ignorance of the conditions related to the problem; he also strongly criticised Sachs’s view that the fact that both animal eyes and plants exhibited a proportional response to light intensity was purely accidental. He concluded that Sach’s opinion was repugnant to the scientific spirit, to logic, and to the facts. Three offprints of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10641.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Timiriazeff 1877</ref>, one inscribed by the author, are in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL.

On 13 July 1878, the major European powers had replaced the Treaty of San Stefano, which had been signed by Russia and Turkey at the end of the Russo-Turkish War in March 1878, with the Treaty of Berlin. The Treaty of Berlin revised the peace settlement to serve the interests of Great Britain and Austria-Hungary by re-establishing Turkish rule and maintaining the Ottoman Empire as a European power, despite widespread condemnation of the Turks for atrocities in Bulgaria in 1876.
