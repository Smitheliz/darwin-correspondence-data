<p>I received a few weeks ago your kind note dated Nov. 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> &amp; this morning Part 6. of your magnificent work on Orchids.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have read your account of Calæna &amp; <hi rend="underline">most</hi> curious it is; but I have as yet looked only at the other Plates. Your account of Calæna reminds me of the case of the Fly Ophrys in Europe; only here when fertilisation does occur it is cross-fertilisation.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You will think me a bigot but I cannot avoid the belief that it may prove to be so with Calæna. It is, however, now evident that there is more self-fertilisation with the Orchideæ than I had supposed. From my experiments on the effects of self-fertilising &amp; crossing, I imagine that a species could endure for a very long period self-fertilisation, unless it were subjected to very severe competition with other plants.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Should you on further consideration desire to dedicate your truly magnificent work to me, I can assure you that I shall feel greatly honoured.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Believe me, my dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I am always inclined to believe that every detail of structure has a meaning, but it would, I suppose, puzzle any one to conjecture the meaning of the wonderfully elongated divisions of the perianth of Sarcochilus Divitiflorus, as shown in your last Plate.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Fitzgerald’s letter has not been found; he had sent CD the sixth part (dated July 1880) of his work <hi rend="italic">Australian orchids</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8668.xml">R. D. Fitzgerald 1875–94</ref>). CD had received the first part in 1875 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 23, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10069.xml">letter to R. D. Fitzgerald, 16 July 1875</ref> and n. 1). CD’s copies of the parts of this work are in the Darwin Library–CUL.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Fitzgerald had concluded from his observations that the Australian orchid genus <hi rend="italic">Caleana</hi>, whose structure seemed to preclude insect pollination, reproduced through self-fertilisation; he also stated that whatever the mechanism, the flowers were seldom fertilised (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8668.xml">R. D. Fitzgerald 1875–94</ref>, 1: part 6, opposite the plate illustrating <hi rend="italic">Caleana major</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Caleana minor</hi>). In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6011.xml"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, pp. 45–9, CD stated that the fly ophrys (<hi rend="italic">Ophrys muscifera</hi>), though rarely visited by insects, was most likely cross-fertilised by them; he wondered, however, why the plant produced so many flowers when so few were fertilised. He concluded that it seemed that something was ‘out of order in its mechanism or in its conditions’ (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 49).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The results of CD’s experiments on this subject had been published in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8595.xml"><hi rend="italic">Cross and self fertilisation</hi></ref>, pp. 285–91.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Fitzgerald’s first volume, comprising the first seven parts of <hi rend="italic">Australian orchids</hi>, was published in 1882 after CD’s death; it was dedicated ‘to the memory of the late <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Darwin</ref>, as a token of the veneration in which that great naturalist and fearless expounder of science is held’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In his description of <hi rend="italic">Sarcochilus divitiflorus</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Rhinerrhiza divitiflora</hi>), Fitzgerald noted that it was very distinct from other Australian members of the genus (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8668.xml">R. D. Fitzgerald 1875–94</ref>, 1: part 6, opposite the plate illustrating <hi rend="italic">Sarcochilus divitiflorus</hi>). It is now the only species in the genus <hi rend="italic">Rhinerrhiza</hi>.</note>
