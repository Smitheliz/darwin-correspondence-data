<p>About four years ago my cousin<ref target="#foot.f1"/> brought from Gibraltar a lump of stalactitic concretion containing bones— Sir C Lyell’s book has interested me in examining it &amp; I am strongly impressed with the idea that they are human.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> a medical friend here<ref target="#foot.f3"/> to whom I have shown the lump also thinks that the bones are human</p>
<p>My brother<ref target="#foot.f4"/> who visited Gibraltar three years ago was shown by our friend there<ref target="#foot.f5"/> (who is a medical man &amp; who gave the lump above referred to to my cousin) another lump of rock containing what appeared to him to be a portion of a human skull &amp; which I fancy must have come from the same locality as the mass of bones but at present I know nothing whatever of the circumstances under which either of the specimens were found   indeed until Sir C. Lyell’s book made me curious on the subject I had almost forgotten having heard about them—</p>
<p>I wrote to our friend at Gibraltar a few days ago asking him for the loan of the piece of skull &amp; to collect for me any information he c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> gather respecting the circumstances of its occurrence   In the meantime it may perhaps be worth while to submit the lump of concrete to Sir C Lyell &amp; if you would kindly furnish me with his address I shall be interested in placing it before him. as I am entirely unknown to Sir C Lyell perhaps you would not mind mentioning my having written to you on the subject of the bones when you next have occasion to communicate with him—</p>
<p>I am just now interested in the examination of some very fine sections of drift which are being opened out in a Railway Cutting at the Entrance of Coalbrook Dale. (1<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> miles from here)—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The banks of the Severn the railway cutting &amp; a gravel pit above it, afford an almost consecutive section or scores of sections of 160 to 170 feet in height &amp; the top of this great drift bed is nearly 300 feet above the sea level. both the highest &amp; lowest beds composing it are regular sea sand &amp; well washed Pebbles &amp; between them is a stratum of loam silt &amp; Tough clay 50 or 60 feet thick interstratified with thin beds of gravel containing <hi rend="underline">drift</hi>—coal Boulders &amp; marine shells of which I have 7 or 8 species<ref target="#foot.f7"/>   I do not know much about them myself but fancy they are recent species— The great bulk of this drift bed &amp; the strata of tough clays strike me as being very unusual</p>
<p>Believe me to remain D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sir | very truly y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. | Geo Maw. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
