                    <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>

                <div type="transcription">
<p>I am very much obliged to you for so kindly sending me the excellent drawings of the 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> leg of the larva in the different stages,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; for giving me permission to refer to your paper as if published;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; that it will most likely be before my volume which will include in the introduction a mere brief abstract on the anatomy of the cirripedia.— With regard to the metamorphoses my chief work has been in the last stage—&amp; I have done the anatomy in much detail at that period.— It has occurred to me before now, to have been working hard at a subject, &amp; then found that my results had been previously published, &amp; very much provoked I have felt.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> therefore I can appreciate &amp; admire the very pleasant manner in which you received my unpleasant tidings.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I think you will find it useful to preserve small objects, in a way in which I have been accustomed to preserve the results of most of my minute anatomical researches, namely in common water without any spirits, with a Bit of thin glass over the object (without any cell) &amp; <hi rend="underline">gold size</hi> all round the rough edge—objects thus prepared will sometimes keep for a long time &amp; generally for some months.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> If you are inclined to take the trouble to rear any larvæ to the second stage, you could so send them me or better in a very minute bottle of spirits—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Every cirripede that I dissect I preserve the jaws &amp;c. &amp;c. in this manner, which takes no time &amp; often comes in very useful. This very day I have been using preparations thus made two years since, &amp; they are <hi rend="underline">perfectly</hi> clear &amp; with some <hi rend="underline">colour</hi> preserved, As I am in the way of suggesting—I would strongly advise you to get one of the glass ruled micrometers to slip in eye piece, the whole does not cost much above half a guinea, you would only have to send medium eyepiece to London &amp; you could measure to the 120,000<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or less of an inch, without delaying your work half a minute.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>With every good wish—Believe me | Dear Sir. | Yours faithfully. | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I suppose the Balanus which you call <hi rend="underline">balanoides</hi> encrusts the rocks between high &amp; low water, &amp; are not very large— I ask as a caution, because there are three or four British species, but only one <hi rend="underline">common</hi> on <hi rend="doubleUnderline">tidal</hi> rocks, At Tenby there is however a large, dark coloured steeply conical kind <hi rend="underline">common</hi> on tidal rocks—viz—B. perforatus.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD had asked <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1680.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Forbes</ref> to ask Bate for specimens (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Edward Forbes, [1 May – 5 June 1851]</ref>). CD was particularly interested in Bate’s description of the basal segments of the legs in larvae and referred to this in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851): </ref>11.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">A reference to CD’s explanation of the geographical distribution of Arctic and alpine plants, which had been anticipated by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1680.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Forbes</ref> in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2580.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Forbes 1846</ref> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_991.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Browne 1983</ref>, pp. 123–7). In his <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_261.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi></ref>, p. 124, CD recorded that: <quote> I was forestalled in only one important point, which my vanity has always made me regret, namely, the explanation by means of the Glacial period of the presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals on distant mountain summits and in the arctic regions.</quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Edward Forbes, [1 May – 5 June 1851]</ref>, in which CD discussed the considerable literature on the developmental history of the Cirripedia of which Bate was unaware.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD’s method for preserving specimens accords well with that recommended by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3894.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Thomas Quekett</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6476.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Quekett 1852</ref>, pp. 283–4). Gold size was one of several cements used to fasten the cover slip to a slide. Many of CD’s cirripede preparations in the collection given by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1222.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Darwin</ref> in 1870 to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_795.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Cambridge University</ref> Museum of Zoology are still well preserved after 140 years, although in some cases the cement has run in and spoiled the specimens.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1345.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to C. S. Bate, 18 August [1851]</ref>. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_428.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bate 1851</ref>, pp. 328–9, the author stated: ‘Unfortunately … I have not been able, even with the greatest care and watchfulness, to preserve the young creature alive, so as to have the successive forms through which it passes’. CD was unaware that there is, in fact, no second stage larva as depicted in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1104.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Burmeister 1834</ref> and reproduced in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854)</ref>, Plate XXX, fig. 1 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1481.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D.

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD presumably used the negative eye-piece micrometer designed for his Smith and Beck dissecting microscope (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1166.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Richard Owen, [26 March 1848]</ref>, and also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_490.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Beck 1865</ref>). A good example of CD’s use of the micrometer is found in the table on the generic characters of the larval prehensile antennae in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851): </ref>286–7. He gave the dimensions of the larval antennae in various genera to 120000 of an inch.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Bate’s paper treated the development of five species of Balanidae, including <hi rend="italic">Balanus balanoides</hi>, <hi rend="italic">B. porcatus</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">B. perforatus</hi>.</note>
