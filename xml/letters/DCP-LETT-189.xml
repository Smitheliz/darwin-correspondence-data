<p>Sketches the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi>’s travels – Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, cruise to the south and return – and what the future holds. Writes with nostalgia of England and says he sees no end to the voyage.</p> 
            <p>He enjoys and has been lucky principally in geology and among pelagic animals; has found remains of large extinct animals.</p>

<p>I am going to take you at your word, &amp; send you a very short letter sooner than none.— It may appear very odd to you, but I never found so much difficulty in writing letters, as at present.—</p>
<p>There is so much to say, or might be said, that I am quite overwhelmed &amp; generally finish by saying very little.— After leaving Rio de Janeiro, we sailed to M: Video.—from whence we had a surveying cruize to the South.— (at Rio I wrote to you).— All this part of S America is wonderfully stupid; sand hillocks &amp; undulating plains makes a poor change after mountains &amp; vallies glowing with the rich vegetation of the Tropics.— At M: Video we had not heard from anybody for four month: &amp; as you may suppose, like a Vulture I devoured yours &amp; other letters. I was very sorry, my dear old Fox, to hear from yourself &amp; home, that you had been so unwell; I trust that when you receive this you will be sitting, well &amp; cheerful, by a blazing fireside.— Eheu Eheu how long will it be before I enjoy that pleasure.— In about a weeks time, we sail down the coast for the Falkland islands &amp; then for Cape Horn. I suspect there will be some difference between this &amp; an English fire side: it would all be very tolerable, if there was some moderate limit steadily to look forward to.— But the Captains plans enlarge as the time advances, &amp; I see no end to the voyage.— We return from Cape Horn &amp; winter in the Plata; from thence we go to the other side &amp; coast up to Panama, &amp; then our voyage may be said again to commence.—</p>
<p>During these last month, the only source of enjoyment, &amp; it has been a large one, has been from Nat: History.— I have principally been lucky in Geology &amp; amongst pelagic animals.— An old piece of ambition of mine has been gratified, viz finding the remains of large extinct animals I think some of them are new; I have teeth &amp; fragments of about 7 kinds. Even this does not reconcile me to leaving the golden regions of ye Tropics.— My peep at these climates has quite spoiled me for any other; I must however except the English autumnal day, the clearness of the atmosphere of which will stand comparison with anything.— Poor dear old England. I hope my wanderings will not unfit me for a quiet life, &amp; that in some future day, I may be fortunate enough to be qualified to become, like you a country Clergyman. And then we will work together at Nat. History, &amp; I will tell such prodigious stories, as no Baron Monchausen ever did before.— But the Captain says if I indulge in such visions, as green fields &amp; nice little wives &amp;c &amp;c, I shall certainly make a bolt.— So that I must remain contented with sandy plains &amp; great Megatheriums:—</p>
<p>At this present moment we are beating against a dead foul wind, on our return from B. Ayres to M Video.— Buenos Ayres is a fine large city &amp; has an Europæan appearance, with the exception of a few wild Gauchos, with their bright coloured ponchos, riding through the streets.— Do you know Heads book? it gives an excellent account of the manners of this country.—</p>
<p>I hope you will write to me again: &amp; recollect that all details about yourself gain in interest instead of losing from the distance: S. America, by itself will be the best direction for the Beagle: I shall be very busy next week in packing specimens. Henslow most kindly has undertaken to receive them. It is one more to the many many obligations I owe to him.— I always consider it one of the luckiest days in my life, when you introduced me to him.— The friendship of such a man, is indeed worth gaining:— Good bye, dear Fox. God bless you &amp; keep you as happy, as you deserve to be, &amp; Write to me again.</p>
<p>Yours very affectionately, Chas Darwin.—</p>
