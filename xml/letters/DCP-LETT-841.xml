<p>Having heard from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lyell that you feel inclined to publish a second edition of my Journal, I take the liberty of addressing you on the subject.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lyell has shown you a copy of the agreement by which I am legally free to publish with anyone, and I am bound to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colburn by no other claim: I could explain by word of mouth a transaction of such a nature on his part, that nothing should induce me to have any further business-transaction with him.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It was entirely through Capt. FitzRoy, that our work was published by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colburn.— I should propose to shorten a little, in a second edition, the geology &amp; natural History &amp; add something to my notices on the Fuegian savages &amp;c &amp;c; though I cannot add much, as I did not take many notes, leaving the subject to Capt. FitzRoy: I apprehend the corrected volume would be nearly its present size without the appendix perhaps a little smaller: I hope to derive advantage from the notes to a late German Edition.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Some few woodcuts might be added if you thought it adviseable.</p>
<p>The only difficulty which I see in the way of a second edition, is my ignorance how many copies remain unsold,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; how to ascertain this or how their purchase, if as I believe, they are few, could be negotiated:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I should be most unwilling to enter into any communication with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colburn, &amp; I am sure, from past experience, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not manage it successfully.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colburn has not for a long time noticed my volume in his advertising lists; &amp; even if 〈he〉 had done so, the channel is an indifferent one: many people, to this day, believe that my work is united to Captain King’s &amp; FitzRoy’s</p>
<p>If I may at all judge from the opinion of scientific acquaintances, I should hope for a considerable sale: I may mention, that Capt. Basil Hall, long ago, urged me to publish a cheaper edition.— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be perfectly satisfied to see my Journal in your excellent Colonial Library, or published in any other manner by you, which you might think preferable.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I beg to apologise for the length of th〈is〉 〈    〉 &amp; I hope, whenever convenient to yourse〈lf〉 that I may hear your views on this subject.</p>
<p>I beg to remain | Sir | Yours faithfully | C. Darwin</p>
