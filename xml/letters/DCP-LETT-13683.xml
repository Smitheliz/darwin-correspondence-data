<p>Charles desires me to join him in thanking you for your very kind, &amp; especially for your expression of sympathy in the loss we have had, which is felt as much by the sons &amp; daughter to whom Erasmus was more than most uncles are—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Charles begs me to say that he has not the least objection to the sentence in which you refer to him &amp; he begs you will use whatever words you prefer.—only it looks a little like praising himself if you put it exactly in the way you propose viz. “I know from my cousin that he also gained his views by his (<hi rend="underline">wonderfully acute</hi>) observations &amp;c— If the words I have marked were omitted it would not have the effect I think—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I often think of the happy days at Penally, &amp; now my sister is gone there is no one to whom I can recall old times.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I very often used to hear of you—</p>
<p>Will you give my kind remembrances to Mrs Fox &amp; her son Charles whom we saw here<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; believe me with C’s kindest regards sincerely | E. Darwin</p>
