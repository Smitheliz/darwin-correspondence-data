<p>I am very much obliged for your kind letter. I had already heard with great regret the news of Chauncey Wright’s sudden death.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> In my answer to my informant, I am glad to think that I used almost the same words which you do in your letter, for I spoke of my admiration for his high intellectual powers &amp; of his great kindness of heart. It is touching to me to hear that he felt so kindly towards me, &amp; that he died with my last book before him.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I had no idea that he would have cared for it, otherwise I would assuredly have sent him a copy. I must try to see his “Darwinism in Germany” in the Nation.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I entirely agree with you about the power shewn in many of his almost casual remarks, &amp; I see that others have been struck with them, for Prof. Rolleston, in a recent address, alludes with admiration to one on the relation of the brain of Man to his power of acquiring language.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>As for myself I have nothing to say, except that I am able to go on working daily with much enjoyment, yet with many groans &amp; sighs.</p>
<p>You say nothing about your own health, which I sincerely hope is better than when you were in England.</p>
<p>Pray give our kindest remembrances to all your party. We have a very pleasant remembrance of your stay at Keston—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Leonard, to whom you &amp; the Sedgwicks were so very kind, started about 3 weeks ago for Malta, where he will be stationed for some years.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Believe me my dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Norton | yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. That is a very striking &amp; nice article, whoever wrote it, in the Boston Advertiser, which I suppose I owe to you—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
