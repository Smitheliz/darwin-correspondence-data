<p>It was very good of you to write me so long a letter which has interested me much; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have answered it sooner, but I have not been very well for the few last days. Your letter has, also, flattered me much in many points.</p>
<p>I am very glad you have been thinking over the relation of subsidence &amp; the accumulation of deposits:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> it has to me removed many great difficulties; please to observe that I have carefully abstained from saying that sediment is not deposited during periods of elevation, but <hi rend="doubleUnderline">only</hi> that it is not accumulated to sufficient thickness to withstand subsequent beach action: on both coasts of S. America, the amount of sediment deposited, worn away &amp; redeposited oftentimes must have been enormous, but still there have been no wide formations produced: just read my discussion (p. 135 of my S. American Book) again with this in your mind.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I never thought of your difficulty (ie in relation to this discussion) of where was the land whence the 3 miles of S. Wales strata were derived?<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Do you not think that it may be explained, by a form of elevation, which I have always suspected to have been very common (&amp; indeed had once intended getting all facts together). viz thus  [DIAGRAM HERE] mountains &amp; continent rising ocean bottom subsiding</p>
<p>The <hi rend="underline">frequency</hi> of a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">deep</hi> ocean <hi rend="underline">close</hi> to a rising continent, bordered with mountains, seems to indicate these opposite movements of rising &amp; sinking <hi rend="underline">close together</hi>: this w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. easily explain the S. Wales &amp; Eocene cases.— I will only add that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> think there w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be a <hi rend="underline">little</hi> more sediment produced during subsidence than during elevation, from the resulting outline of coast after long period of rise.— There are many points in my vol<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. which I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have liked to have discussed with you, but I will not plague you: I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to hear whether you think there is anything in my <hi rend="underline">conjecture</hi> on Craters of Elevation;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I cannot possibly believe that St. Jago or Mauritius are the basal fragments of ordinary volcanos; I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> sooner even admit E. de Beaumont’s view than that; <hi rend="underline">much</hi> as I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> sooner in my own mind in all cases follow you.— Just look at p. 232 in my S. America for trifling point,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> which however, I remember, to this day releived my mind of a considerable difficulty.—</p>
<p>I remember being struck with your discussion on the Missisippi beds<ref target="#foot.f7"/> in relation to Pampas, but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. wish to read them over again, I have, however, relent your work to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Rich,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> who, like all whom I have met, have been much interested by it.— I will stop about my own geology.— But I see I must mention, that Scroope did suggest (&amp; I have alluded to him, p. 118 but without distinct reference &amp; I fear not sufficiently, though I utterly forget what he wrote<ref target="#foot.f9"/> ) the separation of basalt &amp; trachyte, but he does not appear to have thought about the crystals which I believe to be the Keystone of the phenomenon: I cannot but think this separation of the molten elements has played a great part in the metamorphic rocks: how else c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> the basaltic dykes come in great granitic districts such as those of Brazil?— What a wonderful book for labour is D’. Archiac!<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>We are going on as usual: Emma desires her kind love to Lady Lyell: she boldly means to come to Birmingham with me &amp; very glad she is that Lady Lyell will be there:<ref target="#foot.f11"/> two of our children have had a tedious slow fever.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I go on with my aqueous processes &amp; very steadily but slowly gain health &amp; strength. Against all rules<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I dined at Chevening with L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Mahon,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> who did me the gr<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. honour of calling on me, &amp; how he heard of me, I can’t guess— I was charmed with Lady Mahon, &amp; anyone might have been proud at the praises of agreeableness which came from her beautiful lips with respect to you.— I liked old L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Stanhope<ref target="#foot.f15"/> very much; though he abused geology &amp; zoology heartily— “To suppose that the omnipotent God made a world, found it a failure, &amp; broke it up &amp; then made it again &amp; again broke it up, as the geologists say, is all fiddle faddle”.— Describing <hi rend="underline">species</hi> of birds &amp; shells &amp;c is all “fiddle faddle”.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> But yet I somehow liked him better than L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Mahon.—</p>
<p>I am heartily glad we shall meet at Birmingham, as I trust we shall if my health will but keep up.— I work now every day at the Cirripedia for 2<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> hours &amp; so get on a little but very slowly.— I sometimes after being a whole week employed &amp; having described, perhaps only 2 species agree mentally with L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Stanhope that it is all fiddle-faddle: however the other day I got the curious case of a unisexual, instead of hermaphrodite, cirripede, in which the female had the common cirripedial character, &amp; in two of the valves of her shell had two little pockets, in <hi rend="underline">each</hi> of which she kept a little husband;<ref target="#foot.f17"/> I do not know of any other case where a female invariably has two husbands.— I have one still odder fact, common to several species, namely that though they are hermaphrodite, they have small additional or as I shall call them Complemental males:<ref target="#foot.f18"/> one specimen itself hermaphrodite had no less than <hi rend="underline">seven</hi> of these complemental males attached to it. Truly the schemes &amp; wonders of nature are illimitable.— But I am running on as badly about my Cirripedia as about Geology: it makes me groan to think that probably, I shall never again have the exquisite pleasure of making out some new district,—of evoking geological light out of some troubled, dark region.— So I must make the best of my Cirripedia.—</p>
<p>Remember me most kindly to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bunbury.— I am sorry to hear how weak your Father is—<ref target="#foot.f19"/> | Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is based on the endorsement and the dates of the Birmingham British Association meeting. CD left for Birmingham on 11 September 1849. In his health diary (Down House MS) CD recorded that he was well from 20 to 29 August, but that he was ‘Poorly’ and ‘exhausted’ from 30 August to 1 September.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Lyell was preparing a paper on ‘craters of denudation’ (C. Lyell 1850a), read to the Geological Society on 19 December 1849, in which the effects of elevation and subsidence on volcanic deposits were discussed.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD’s explanation of the absence of conchiferous deposits as due to denudation and subsidence is in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7343.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">South America</hi></ref>, pp. 135–9.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The denudation of South Wales had been the subject of much discussion between CD, Lyell, and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3922.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Andrew Crombie Ramsay</ref> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 3, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1004.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, [3 October 1846]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1008.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to A. C. Ramsay, 10 October [1846]</ref>). Lyell did not, however, discuss South Wales in C. Lyell 1850a but rather in his anniversary address to the Geological Society on 15 February 1850 (C. Lyell 1850b, pp. liii, liv–vi).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">This was the name given by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_697.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Christian Leopold von Buch</ref>, and adopted by Jean Baptiste Armand Louis Léonce élie de Beaumont, to the theory originally proposed by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2443.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alexander von Humboldt</ref> that volcanic cones were formed by upward pressure, rather than by the eruption of lava through vents. Such pressure raised originally horizontal layers into a dome that was easily broken through. Lyell had opposed this view as early as 1830 in the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Principles of geology</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4986.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1830–3</ref>). For a history of the controversy see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1900.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dean 1980</ref>. CD speculated that the mountains might still be considered ‘craters of elevation’ by slow elevation, in which the central hollows were formed ‘not by the arching of the surface, but simply by that part having been raised to a less height’ (<hi rend="italic">Volcanic Islands</hi>, p. 96).</note>
