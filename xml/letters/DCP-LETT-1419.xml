<p>On this day I must write to you knowing that our hearts have one common feeling, &amp; that I need not fear to hurt you—in telling you that Hensleigh &amp; I are just returned from that sad &amp; last work of laying your dear child in her earthly resting place— We went at 9 o’clock &amp; I think every thing was rightly arranged as you would have wished— I feared for Miss Thorley &amp; still more for poor Brodie &amp; she has suffered poor thing most sadly &amp; had to be lifted into the carriage, but since she has been relieved by a long fit of crying &amp; is lying down now— Miss Thorley was more composed than I expected only now &amp; then with bursts of grief—poor thing— There never could have been a child laid in the ground with truer sorrow round her than your sweet &amp; happy Annie— How very kind in you my dear Emma to write me your note—at such a time. I felt it such a comfort on my return to the house to find it, &amp; that you were then as I hoped having Charles with you— I cannot be surprised at yr fears for him it will be hardly possible that he should not be ill— I shall be very anxious to hear how he arrived &amp; I know I shall have a line on Monday from dear Fanny or Elizabeth I am sure he could not have gone through being with us this morning—&amp; have never ceased being thankful that he went yesterday—</p>
<p>I have advised Brodie to go straight home tomorrow she longs to be there &amp; when she finds you want her I hope she will be able to put restraint on herself<ref target="#foot.f1"/> She can be at Down before 9 oclock we have taken Miss Thorley out a drive &amp; she is better— She thanks you with her grateful love for your message &amp; she will write to you fm home— We all leave this sad place together at 9 tomorrow morning— Thank you dearest Emma for telling me I had given you some comfort—&amp; Thank God that you are well—</p>
