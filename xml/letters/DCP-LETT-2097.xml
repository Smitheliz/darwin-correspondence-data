<p>I am delighted that you went to Manchester, &amp; had so prosperous an expedition.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You seem to have worked capitally &amp; seen it well. We are amused at your adoration of the haughty Lady.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I quite agree with your admiration of Gainsborough’s portraits: one of the Pictures which has ever most struck me is a portrait by him in the Dulwich Gallery.— By the way how stupid it has been in us never to have suggested your riding to Dulwich &amp; seeing the capital publick Gallery there.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Then, again, there are some few good pictures at Knole.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>You want a jobation about your handwriting—dreadfully bad &amp; not a stop from beginning to end! After severe labour in deciphering we <hi rend="underline">rather think</hi> that your outlay was, 1 12 0 &amp; accordingly I send that, but I hope it is too little to punish you for such a scrawl. I am glad that you were tipped but that makes no difference in my repaying your outlay.—</p>
<p>By the way have you no paper, so that you cross your letter, or do you think your handwriting is too clear? You want pitching into severely.—</p>
<p>I have had a letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mayor<ref target="#foot.f6"/> (about his Bankers mistake) in which he says he has heard so grand an account of your future master’s, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Temple, attainments, that he wants to persuade me to leave you at Rugby till October.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mayor says he shall <hi rend="underline">very much</hi> miss you.— Think over this well &amp; deliberately, &amp; do not be guided by fleeting motives. You shall settle for yourself, whatever you think will be really best, not pleasantest, shall be done— The school would be least trouble &amp; expence; but I cannot help <hi rend="underline">rather</hi> thinking that the Tutor would get you on best.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Let me hear before very long. And if you still think of tutor, talk to Mayor, &amp; then I will write to the Tutor to know whether he can take you. When ought you to go? &amp; what summer vacations?</p>
<p>Your most affect<hi rend="superscript">te</hi> | C. Darwin</p>
<p>PS. | Though I have abused you so for your bad writing, I must say that you were <hi rend="underline">very</hi> good to send us such a <hi rend="underline">capital</hi> account of all you did &amp; saw.—</p>

By the time the exhibition closed on 17 October, over a million people had attended.

Mrs Graham’ was exhibited in the gallery of modern paintings at the Manchester Art-Treasures Exhibition. The reference to the ‘haughty Lady’ may have come from a description in one of the guide-books to the exhibition: ‘Who is there will bid farewell to our glorious Exhibition without taking a last fond look at pretty Mistress Graham … She looks petted and spoiled, made haughty by flattery and adulation.’ (<hi rend="italic">The Art-Treasures examiner</hi>, p. 296).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The gallery at Dulwich College, built by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4451.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Soane</ref>, was the first public art gallery in England.

If the autumn term was to be William’s last at Rugby, his housemaster would need advance notice.
