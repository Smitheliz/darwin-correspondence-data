                    <salute>My dear Darwin,—</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I was so busy with the last chapters of my new edition of the ‘Elements’ before I left town a month ago,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> that I did not reply to your kind letter<ref target="#foot.f3"/> about my after-dinner speech on your Copley medal at the Royal Society anniversary.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have some notes of it, and hope one day to run over it with you, especially as it was somewhat of a confession of faith as to the ‘Origin.’ I said I had been forced to give up my old faith without thoroughly seeing my way to a new one.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> But I think you would have been satisfied with the length I went. The Duke of Argyll expresses in his address to the Edinburgh Royal Society very much what I have done (‘Antiquity of Man,’ p. 469), that variation or natural selection cannot be confounded with the creational law without such a deification of them as exaggerates their influence.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> He seems to me to have put the difficulty pretty clearly, but on the other hand he has not brought out as fully as I should have liked him to have done, the great body of evidence so admirably brought to bear in your work, in proof of the bond of mutual descent, and the manner in which species and genera branched from common ancestors. He did not entertain this idea till he had read your book, and he is now evidently impressed with it, as I am; and he would, I think, go the whole length, were it not for the necessity of admitting, in order to be consistent, that man and the quadrumana came from a common stock. He does, indeed, in defiance of consistency, admit for the humming-birds what he will not admit for the <hi rend="underline">primates</hi>, and Guizot’s theology is introduced to support him;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> but the address is a great step towards your views—far greater, I believe, than it seems when read merely with reference to criticisms and objections. The reasoning about materialism appears to me admirably put,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> and his definition of the various senses in which we use the term ‘law’;<ref target="#foot.f9"/> though, having only read the speech once, I am not yet able to judge critically on all these points. He assumes far too confidently that the colours of the humming-birds are for mere ornament and beauty.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I can conceive a meaning in your sense for the advantage of the creature, or of its friends and enemies, in every coloured ray of light reflected from the plumes.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> We must indeed know far more than we do before we can dogmatise on the irrelevancy of particular colours to the well-being of a species. He ought also to define beauty, and tell us whether it is in reference to man or bird. I have no objection to the idea of beauty or variety for its own sake, but to assume it so positively is unphilosophical.</p>
<p>We have been about three weeks at Berlin, and I had some good geological talk with Ferdinand Roemer, Beyrich, Von Kœnen, Gustav Rose, Ewald, Dr. Roth, and Dove the meteorologist, besides Ehrenberg, Magnus, Lepsius, and Du Bois- Reymond,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> and an animated conversation on Darwinism with the Princess Royal, who is a worthy daughter of her father, in the reading of good books and thinking of what she reads.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> She was very much <hi rend="underline">au fait</hi> at the ‘Origin’ and Huxley’s book, the ‘Antiquity,’ &amp;c. &amp;c.,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> and with the Pfahlbauten Museums which she lately saw in Switzerland.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> She said after twice reading you she could not see her way as to the origin of four things; namely the world, species, man, or the black and white races. Did one of the latter come from the other, or both from some common stock? And she asked me what I was doing, and I explained that in recasting the ‘Principles’ I had to give up the independent creation of each species.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> She said she fully understood my difficulty, for after your book ‘the old opinions had received a shake from which they never would recover.’ I shall be very glad to hear what you think of the Duke of Argyll’s comments on the ‘Origin’.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> I think that your book is a vast step towards showing the methods which have been followed in creation, which is as much as science can ever reach, and the Duke, I think, has not fully appreciated the advance which has been made, even in his own mind.</p>
<p>I had hoped that a copy of the ‘Elements’<ref target="#foot.f18"/> would have been sent to you while I was still at Berlin. You will find much that is new, and nothing, I think, clashing with the ‘Origin’. Please read my description of the Atlantis theory.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> I fear I shall return and find the book still unborn, which is too bad of the printer. Please let me know how your health has been during the last four weeks.</p>
<p>Ever most truly yours | Charles Lyell.</p>
<p>P.S. In an article in the Berlin ‘Punch’ on the Pope’s encyclical, in which all the innovations which trouble his Holiness are enumerated, ‘Die Darwinische Lehre die uns alle Affen macht’ was not forgotten.<ref target="#foot.f20"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4009.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 24[–5] February [1863]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4028.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 6 March [1863]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4041.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Charles Lyell, 15 March 1863</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Lyell refers to the address delivered to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 5 December 1864 by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_802.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Douglas Campbell</ref>, eighth duke of Argyll (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1186.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">G. D. Campbell 1864</ref>). Campbell distinguished between laws such as natural selection, which determine the success of existing species or modifications, and creational laws, which produce modifications or new forms of life. According to Campbell, CD had frequently forgotten this distinction in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, and had written ‘of natural selection “producing” this and that modification of structure’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1186.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">G. D. Campbell 1864</ref>, pp. 275–6). Campbell had sent Lyell a copy of his address; in his <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Campbell of 25 January 1865</ref> (I. E. Campbell ed. 1906, 2: 484), Lyell remarked, ‘Your objection that Darwin has in some parts of his book made natural selection do more in the way of originating or creating than is admissable, or even consistent, with his own explanation of natural selection, was felt strongly by me.... Darwin is inclined to believe that he has made a greater step in the direction of discovering an originating cause or law than he has really made’. Lyell had made a similar point in <hi rend="italic">Antiquity of man</hi> (C. Lyell 1863a, p. 469): ‘If we confound “Variation” or “Natural Selection” with such creational laws, we deify secondary causes or immeasurably exaggerate their influence’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Campbell claimed that despite the close physical affinity between humans and the lower animals, human descent could not be explained on the same principles that might plausibly govern the descent of birds. ‘We are conscious,’ he wrote, ‘of an amount and of a kind of difference between ourselves and the lower animals, which is, in sober truth, immeasurable, in spite of the close affinities of bodily structure’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1186.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">G. D. Campbell 1864</ref>, p. 288). In support of his position, Campbell cited the French statesman and historian <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5806.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">François Guizot</ref>, who maintained that humans could not have survived unless they had appeared with all of their faculties and powers fully developed (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1186.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">G. D. Campbell 1864</ref>, p. 289, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3190.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Guizot 1864</ref>, p. 49). For Campbell’s earlier reservations about <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, see his presidential address to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 3 December 1860 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1184.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">G. D. Campbell 1860</ref>, pp. 371–6).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">In the conclusion of his address (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1186.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">G. D. Campbell 1864</ref>, pp. 291–2), Campbell stated that recent developments in science tended to show that ‘all the realities of nature [were] in the region of the Invisible’; for example, current work in physiology suggested that ‘material organs [were] merely the special forms built up and fashioned by the vital forces … for the discharge of special functions’. In his <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Campbell of 25 January 1865</ref> (I. E. Campbell ed. 1906, 2: 484), Lyell praised the address for having done ‘a real service to the scientific and theological public by showing … that there is no tendency to materialism in the reasoning or speculations of modern naturalists and physicists, but quite the contrary’. For a discussion of materialism in the context of debates between scientific practitioners and theologians in Britain in the 1860s, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_411.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Barton 1987</ref>, pp. 130–3.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Campbell distinguished between a notion of law that referred to an observed order of facts, and other notions of law that involved the operation of forces and the fulfilment of purposes (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1186.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">G. D. Campbell 1864</ref>, p. 270).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">According to Campbell, CD’s theory of descent by natural selection was only able to account for changes that were of direct use to organisms in the struggle for existence, and was therefore incomplete (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1186.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">G. D. Campbell 1864</ref>, pp. 276–81). He argued (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 277) that humming-birds had a great many ‘structures designed for mere ornament, and entirely separate from any other known or conceivable use’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 88–90, CD briefly discussed his theory of sexual selection, according to which ornamental characteristics developed as a result of competition between the male members of a species for the possession of females. However, CD argued that for birds the process was ‘more peaceful’. The colourful plumage of birds developed as a result of females choosing the most visually attractive partner. The subject of beauty in birds is also discussed in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3118.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to W. B. Tegetmeier, 14 April [1861]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3167.xml" resp="#automat">letter from B. P. Brent, 29 May 1861</ref>.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f19">In order to explain similarities between the Miocene plants of Europe and the modern plants of the Atlantic states of North America, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4842.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Franz Unger</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2199.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Oswald Heer</ref> had proposed the existence of a continent in the present basin of the Atlantic, over which plants had migrated eastward from America to Europe (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7933.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Unger 1860</ref>, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3482.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Heer 1855–9</ref> and 1860). The Atlantis theory was criticised on botanical grounds by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref> and later by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3589.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Daniel Oliver</ref>, who argued that plants had migrated westward, across America and Asia (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Gray 1858–9</ref>, Oliver 1862). Lyell discussed various criticisms of Heer’s Atlantis theory in <hi rend="italic">Elements of geology</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5031.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1865</ref>, pp. 265–73); he also mentioned CD’s suggestion, presented in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 369–72, that plant migrations during a warmer, pre-glacial period (following the Miocene), accounted for the fairly uniform distribution of plants across polar regions and throughout subarctic and temperate regions as well (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5031.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1865</ref>, p. 270). Lyell noted that the Atlantis theory required ‘a prodigious amount of subsidence in a comparatively brief period’, and concluded: ‘the theory which derives the American types from the east instead of the west seems by far the most natural’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5031.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1865</ref>, pp. 270, 271). However, Lyell was not convinced that a single genus originated in one location, from which it dispersed, as did a species; he thought that this assumption, inherent in CD’s transmutation theory, might weaken the arguments for either a westward or an eastward Miocene migration. Using the example of species of the walnut genus that had flourished in the European Eocene before the supposed migration of other walnut species from America, he cautioned the reader to bear in mind the assumption of a single origin of a genus. He added, however, that this was ‘not the place to enter into a question so difficult and unsettled as that of the origin of species’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5031.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1865</ref>, p. 272).

            <note xml:id="foot.f20">Pope Pius IX’s encyclical was published 8 December 1864, in conjunction with the ‘syllabus of [modern] errors’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1322.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Catholic encyclopedia</hi></ref>, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2340.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Enchiridion symbolorum</hi></ref>). A commentary appeared in the Berlin satirical journal <hi rend="italic">Kladderadatsch</hi>, 15 January 1865, p. 10. It referred to ‘die Derwin’sche Lehre, dass schon unsere Grossältern Affen waren’ (‘the Darwinian theory, that even our grandparents were apes’). Lyell, probably quoting from memory, wrote: ‘the Darwinian theory that makes apes of us all’.</note>
