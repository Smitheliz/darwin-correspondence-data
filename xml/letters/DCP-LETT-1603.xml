<p>I hope you will excuse the great liberty I take in addressing you, but I trust my long acquaintance with your honoured Father may serve me as an introduction.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> When on board H.M.S. Beagle I particularly attended to glacial deposits, &amp; I am now very much interested on this subject,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; most earnestly want to know whether any distinct phenomena of this kind have been observed in New Zealand.— When I was in Bay of Islands I saw several large boulders of greenstone, but as I did not know the surrounding country, &amp; as they were in valleys &amp; not on isolated hillocks, I was not able to tell whether they were true erratic boulders,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> or merely blocks washed down by chance floods &amp;c &amp;c from greater heights. Now I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. esteem it a great favour if you would inform me on your own authority, (or on that of any other <hi rend="underline">competent</hi> observer, if such there be in N. Zealand) whether there are any <hi rend="underline">great</hi> blocks of rock, especially if <hi rend="underline">angular</hi>, which have certainly been transported from a <hi rend="underline">long</hi> distance, or which must have crossed valleys or arms of the sea in their course. And lastly whether any one has observed moraines or the marks of glaciers having formerly descended to a lower level on the New Zealand Mountains. The Southern islands w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. of course be the most favourable for the chance of the discovery of ancient erratic &amp; glacial action, but I fear that has been rarely visited by instructed persons.</p>
<p>Hoping that you will forgive my asking you to take the trouble to inform me; I remain, Dear Sir | Your’s faithfully &amp; obliged | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>I may add that on stating how anxious I was to obtain the foregoing information, I was encouraged by Sir Charles &amp; Lady Lyell to take the liberty of addressing you.—</p>
