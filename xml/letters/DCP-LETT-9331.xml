            <p>The row at the Linnean Society and other troubles.</p>
            <p>The Agricultural Society has sent Anton De Bary £100 to investigate the potato disease – an insult to M. J. Berkeley, who had worked on it for 30 years.</p>

<p>I have long been waiting to write to you but have been prevented by a “pack of troubles”— The receipt of the enclosed from Asa Gray breaks the silence, &amp; gives me a little pleasure, indeed a great one, for the more honors you get from really independent bodies, the better it is for Science.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>The Linnean rows have distressed me more than I can tell— the brutality of that Owenised Scotchman (of old Crawford “d–d Scotchman” type) has chasséed poor Bentham from the chair,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; made the Society a Scorn &amp; bye-word<ref target="#foot.f3"/> to the public for the moment.</p>
<p>I have been working every day since to get support for the Council at the special meeting on Thursday, &amp; to inoculate the fellows with good feelings. In all this I am aided most splendidly by Dyer; &amp; Strachey has taken up the war-cry in a way which I hope will do great good. As a councillor, &amp; as one against whom (as representative of Kew &amp; as Bentham’s supporter) the shafts are aimed, I do not like to appear too pessimistic, &amp; others embitter the contest—; but I am working day &amp; night for the sake of peace &amp; quiet: You will receive from Strachey a printed <hi rend="underline">Circular</hi>, drawn up by Currey &amp; myself &amp; intended to instruct the Fellows— Carruthers &amp; 12 followers, mostly very young fellows, have sent a most insolent protest to the P. &amp; Council <hi rend="underline">resolving</hi> to go to law, if the by-laws recently passed are not rescinded by the Council!<ref target="#foot.f4"/> A special general meeting is called for the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> at the request of Carruthers &amp; his friends when Busk will take the chair— I shall of course be in the Royal Chair.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am much distressed by an affair in the Office of Works—of which the Chief Secretary, Mr. G. Russell, has been detected cheating at cards in the Turf Club! &amp; it is said will have to resign his post. G.R. has been my right-hand man &amp; support at the office for 17 years— he is the only man in the office who knows &amp; cares a rush for Kew &amp; the Parks;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; I can’t conceive how business can go on without him, for Ayrton chasséed all the gentlemen from the office in 6 months, &amp; except the 2 Secretaries &amp; Galton, there is not a man with an approach to Education in it. Galton is hated by everyone—&amp; the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Secretary, a nice enough fellow, is quite common place.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I only hope that G.R’s resignation (which is I hear unavoidable) may lead to the reorganization of the whole office on a very different footing from hitherto. On personal grounds G. R’s. conduct has distressed and shocked me more than I can express.</p>
<p>I paid a visit to my official Chief yesterday, Ld Henry Lennox who seems to me a good-natured chatterbox with a very good head-piece; they say he has considerable capacity for work<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>This is a dreary letter, but I must add another grief. It is that the Agricult. Socy. have sent to de Bary £100 with a <hi rend="underline">request</hi> to investigate the Potato disease.— This, which is Carruthers doing; (he is Botanical Adviser to the Society) is intended as an insult to Berkeley, who feels it keenly—as it was he who 30 years ago first traced the history &amp; development of the disease, got the prize from France: &amp; de Bary has added scarcely any thing to the subject. Then too we have Currey, Broome, Rainey &amp; others all abundantly qualified for such work in this country.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
