<p>You must forgive my sending you a very dull letter but I have been used rather unfairly— it is Catherines month &amp; she did not tell me this moment that she has not even begun a letter to you &amp; today being the last day I will not fail in my promise of writing myself when the others forget— My Father is very well, which I know is the main thing so it will not matter how little else I have to tell. I remember the anxious feeling I had even during my 3 months in France last year &amp; it is impossible to shake it off when at a distance &amp; for any reason not in good spirits. Your last letter which I answered the middle of December was the one to Susan just before you were to sail from Monte Video. I do hope my very dear Charles the cold &amp; rains whilst coasting Patagonia have not made you ill— we are all impatient for your next letter, &amp; if you find all these changes of Climate do not agree with your health come home &amp; think of your snug parsonage— I finished my last letter at Overton. Parky &amp; Henry feel proud in finding the place on the Map where their Uncle Charles is— Parky is growing very manly coming on nicely in his Latin &amp; the most regular flirt I ever beheld. the week after I came home we had a visit from our new member Uncle Jos.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> he seems very much pleased to have been returned with such a fine Majority &amp; he says he has been at no expence &amp; no trouble doing nothing but what his Committee ordered him &amp; they were very merciful he even escaped being chaired—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> he says he can not afford to bring his family with him to London but I think they expect to go at least for some months— Parliament meets the 31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. of Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>—so he will soon have to leave Maer I hope the experiment will answer to him &amp; that he will not repent— Jessie came with Uncle Jos &amp; they staid two days.— it happened most unfortunately that we all three were going the very evening they arrived (unexpectedly) to Eaton to see a Play acted by the Family party of Williams’s, Owens &amp; Whites— poor Sarah herself did not act— The Owen constitution has quite failed &amp; she is in a very delicate state of health. She looks very unwell &amp; is out of spirits about herself thinking she shall never get strong &amp; well again &amp; can bear no exertion or fatigue</p>
<p>The piece they acted was The Irish Tutor a merry little bustling farce<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; they all played their parts very well— there was afterwards a dance— All the rest of this month has passed perfectly quietly We play at Whist every evening with Papa &amp; I think he seems quite as happy &amp; comfortable as he used to be some years ago— Last week was the New Hunt week. We had nobody with us but the 2 Clives of Styche &amp; Caroline Owen.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Edward Williams died the beginning of the week so there was no party at Eaton— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Tom Pemberton<ref target="#foot.f4"/> is also dead. that y〈ou〉 may know what is going on in this neighbourhood, there have been no marriages except Sir T. Boughy to Miss Louisa Giffard—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> the Hunt ball I did not go to— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Biddulph was there looking very handsome but I suspect she must find M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Biddulph a tiresome person to live with— I am sure he is very selfish he has gained his election &amp; is returned for Denbighshire. Your Pincher &amp; Nina are both very well, I am about buying from Joseph your Grey horse I have tried him &amp; I like him very much as far as I can judge—</p>
<p>Erasmus has been very gay at Parties at Lady Giffords &amp; the Hensleighs &amp;<hi rend="superscript">tc</hi>. he has not written very lately. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Hensleigh is to be confined the beginning of next month so I suppose he can not be junkitting at her house now— Susan &amp; Cath are going to two balls next week &amp; I suppose these balls are Cattys excuse for not having written</p>
<p>they &amp; Papa send their love to you and believe me my dear old fellow, with my own best love to you | Y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> affec<hi rend="superscript">ly</hi> Caroline Darwin</p>
<p>It is too late to wish you a happy new year—but I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> wish it—</p>
