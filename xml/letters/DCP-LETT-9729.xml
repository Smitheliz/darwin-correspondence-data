<p>I beg to forward you the photographs of an Epileptic Idiot, whose case may be interesting from his attitude and mode of progression appearing to simulate more that of the lower animals than man.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> As he died suddenly I was unable to show his remarkable position when about to move which was either on his hands and knees or with the hands raised very slightly from the ground</p>

<p><hi rend="underline">Notes of Case of Michael Feeny, an Epileptic Idiot</hi></p>
<p>M. F Oct 29. Admitted Feb 11/73 Died Aug<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. 19/74</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">History received from Mother</hi>— Patient, an idiot suffering from frequent Epileptic Fits in the early part of his life, decreasing in frequency as he grew older, was the eldest born of five brothers &amp; sisters, all of whom are in good mental &amp; bodily health— The Father &amp; Mother were second cousins—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The Father &amp; Paternal Grandfather died insane</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Mental Condition</hi> Patient may be said to evince only the symp〈to〉ms of the l〈ow〉est form of animal life, shows no desire but for food for which he has a constant craving, has no idea of attention to the calls of nature; his mother states that his habits were such that no servant would remain with her &amp; that the Parish Priest at last insisted on her removing him to the Asylum, but I could not elicit from her that he showed any sexual desire— He always drank from the nearest pool of rain water, dipping his head into it</p>
<p>The peculiarity of the case, however, is he remains constantly in the prone position, when lifted up he immediately lies down again, when placed on a chair he will at once slip back to the ground—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The three photographs show his usual attitude— No 1 represents his position during the day lying on one side, rapping with his head or his hand on the flags— No 2 &amp; 3 show his sitting posture— Unfortunately these photographs were taken after death and though the limbs were placed as nearly as possible in their natural attitude they have lost the characteristics of life— His mode of progression was usually on his hands &amp; knees; or with the upper extremities slightly raised from the ground— He seldom moved far at a time— When disturbed he would occasionally become very vicious, butting those about him with his head which was his constant weapon of offence &amp; with which he had great power— Unable to speak, he makes a curious humming sound</p>
<p>Died Aug<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. 19/74</p>
<p>No postmortem allowed</p>
