<p>I was exceedingly glad to receive your last letter, as I had been for some time past very anxious to hear how you &amp; the rest of your family were after having undergone such a painful affliction.— I should have written before only I waited to get the Bills you mentioned.— Claytons amounts to 2<hi rend="superscript">£</hi>"7"10, but Bakers’ has not arrived yet.—</p>
<p>I have procured for you from Polo a beautiful specimen of the Ring Owzel, &amp; gave 5 shillings, also a young male ring tail, with half the plumage blue &amp; half like the female ring tail price 5<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>.—also 2 fine specimens of the black tern, price 3<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>.—also a Royston Crow.—</p>
<p>Now being upon Nat: history, I will go on: All the Crysalis you left in the deal Box, I never discovered till too late, &amp; found all the moths utterly destroyed. The Cossus has eat its way out &amp; is lost.—</p>
<p>Aiken<ref target="#foot.f1"/> has got all the skins of your birds: he also had my Crysalis, which go on very well, &amp; to which I have added a great many more.— I have taken, or rather had collected for me vast numbers of insects: a good many new ones to Cambridge, both large &amp; small.— have since Christmas filled nearly three Standish Boxes.—</p>
<p>But Hoare’s success is <hi rend="underline">most</hi> brilliant: Carabus intricatus, an insect fit for Paradise; a beautiful Lamprias: Badister cephalotes, &amp; multa alia: My success also has been very good amongst the water beettles. I think I beat Jenyns in Colymbetes.—</p>
<p>I want much to hear what you have done in Entomology? I heard from old Pulleine the other day. he wrote to enquire about you. I told him he had better direct to Osmaston so I daresay before long you will hear from him.</p>
<p>Before I tell you my plans for the next 2 or 3 months, I must most cordially thank you for your very kind invitation to Osmaston. You used accuse me of <hi rend="underline">making speeches</hi> about Osmaston. This accusation although proved to be most palpably absurd by the length of my former visit, shall be made doubly so, by the pleasure with which I accept your invitation. On the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of next month I go to Shrewsbury, either through London, in order to chaperon home my sisters, or else d〈  〉 through Birmingham. A <hi rend="underline">few</hi> days of home, &amp; then I go a three week trip with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hope either in S or W Wales: after that home again (&amp; Woodhouse &amp; Fanny), then to Maer, &amp; then I hope to have the pleasure, my dear Fox of seeing you again, after our long absence: this till August will fill my time up pretty well.—</p>
<p>As to what I have been &amp; am now doing, the less that is said about it, the better: my time is solely occupied in riding &amp; Entomologizing. Simpson or Hall are both industrious when compared with me. I cannot help thinking what a great deal of good advice I should receive were you but here.— I hope you will write soon &amp; tell me all about every thing: I am sorry, although I think you are very wise in not going into orders at present Your mind at such a time must be very unfit for so serious an undertaking: Make any use of me &amp; my rooms in future arrangements that may please you:</p>
<p>Give my most kind remembrances to your father, &amp; I hope that he &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Fox are going on pretty well: | Believe me my dear Fox | Yours most sincerely | Chas. Darwin.—</p>
