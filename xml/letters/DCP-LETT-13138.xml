                    <p>I was very glad to read your last note with much news interesting to me.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But I write now to say how I, &amp; indeed all of us in this house, have admired your letter in the Times. It was so simple &amp; direct.— I was particularly glad about Burdon Sanderson, of whom I have been for several years a great admirer.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I was, also, especially glad to read the last sentences.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have been bothered with several letters, but none abusive.— Under a <hi rend="underline">selfish</hi> point of view I am very glad of the publication of your letter, as I was at first inclined to think that I had done mischief by stirring up the mud. Now I feel sure that I have done good.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jesse has written to me very politely: he says his Soc. has had nothing to do with the placards &amp; diagrams against physiology &amp; I suppose, therefore, that these all originate with the sweet Miss Cobbe.— Good Heavens what a liar she is: did you notice how in her second letter she altered what she quoted from her first letter, trusting to no one comparing the two?—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jesse complains bitterly that the Times will “burk” all his letters to this newspaper; nor am I surprised judging from the laughable tirades advertised in Nature.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Ever yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Romanes’s letter on vivisection was published in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 25 April 1881, p. 10. In it, he defended <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4177.xml">John Scott Burdon Sanderson</ref> against the accusation made by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_984.xml">Frances Power Cobbe</ref> that the experiments in his laboratory at University College, London, were inhumane (<hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 23 April 1881, p. 8). Romanes stated that having worked in Burdon Sanderson’s laboratory for a long time, he could testify that Burdon Sanderson’s methods were ‘uniformly guided by the principles of the purest humanity’. </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">At the end of his letter to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, Romanes had highlighted the animal suffering caused by traps and the need for legislation to enforce the use of humane traps. CD and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml">Emma Darwin</ref> had been involved in a campaign for humane vermin traps in 1863 (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 11, Appendix IX).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">For CD’s letters on vivisection to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13115.xml">letter to Frithiof Holmgren, [14] April 1881</ref>, and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13132.xml">letter to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 21 April [1881]</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13133.xml">letter from G. R. Jesse, 22 April 1881</ref> and n. 5; <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2566.xml">George Richard Jesse</ref> was founder of the Society for the Abolition of Vivisection. In his letter to the <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>, 26 March 1881, p. 525, Jesse wrote that the society he represented disavowed the ‘sensational and revolting illustrated placards’ that had been posted in public places and inserted in a penny newspaper. In her letter in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 19 April 1881, p. 8, Cobbe had quoted passages from the <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8615.xml"><hi rend="italic">Report of the Royal Commission on vivisection</hi></ref>, p. 17,  referring to cruel experiments, but omitted the section that referred to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_9232.xml">François Magendie</ref> as an example of such a practitioner. In her subsequent letter, Cobbe argued that, logically, the commissioners must have intended to include English physiologists in the passages she had cited (<hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 23 April 1881, p. 8).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Anti-vivisectionists, when barred from contributing in the usual way, often inserted letters as advertisements in periodicals. Jesse had sent one of these, made two years earlier, to CD with his letter of <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13129.xml">19 April 1881</ref>. More recent anti-vivisection letters in the advertisement section of <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> include <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_9472.xml">Thomas P. Kirkman</ref>, ‘The Endowment of Research’, <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, 7 April 1881, p. clxxxii, 14 April 1882,  p. cxci, and 21 April 1881, p. cxcix. A paid advertisement by Jesse appeared in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, 28 April 1881, p. ccvii.</note>
