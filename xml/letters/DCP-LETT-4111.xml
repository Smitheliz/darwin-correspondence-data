<p>We returned on Friday having enjoyed the trip most amazingly— visiting Weymouth, Portland &amp; its attractive establishment of rogues &amp; villains, Jersey &amp; Guernsey.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> We had good weather, but the cool ocean kept down the temp. of the Islands, which are now a good 10 days <hi rend="underline">behind</hi> England!</p>
<p>A thousand thanks for your letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am grieved with Falconers letter, he has made out no case for himself or Prestwich, his vanity &amp; presumption are overweening, &amp; the last paragraphs depreciatory of Lyell as an original observer is as bad as any thing Owen ever writ in its way.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am deeply sorry— Lyells answer, though not crushing is damning.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I like its tone temper &amp; spirit— it is manly &amp; temperate—well done in short.—&amp; (were it possible) raises him in my eyes. What can Prestwich be thinking about to lend his weight to such an attack, by getting on F<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. back, instead of fighting along side him, or by himself.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The whole thing is bad</p>
<p>Carpenters love of self has cost him the loss of the best opportunity of smashing Owen that ever was offered to mortal man, &amp; I cannot help thinking that Owen calculated it would be so!—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> C might have smashed Owen like a Black beetle; but his motive was obviously to clear himself of the imputation of being dry-nursed by you,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> &amp; to let the world know that he had a Royal medal!.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I have just received a bottle of cones of Welwitchia in spirits, these actually bristle with the projecting styliform processes of the useless ovules, all on the look out for pollen, of which they never get one grain, nor have the ovules a trace of embryo-sac.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> it confirms my conclusions. &amp; is the most wonderful fact in vegetable embryology. only conceive <hi rend="underline">all</hi> men having huge mammæ with no lactiferous glands whilst women (breeding) had microscopic ones, &amp; yet the case would not be half so wonderful. There never was such a case of a retained organ whose function was gone—&amp; the more I think of it the more I worship your theory.</p>
<p>I do not think Bentham will make much of the question of species, he only proposes to review the state of the question for Linnæan Anniversary.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Have you ever read the “Admiral’s daughter”, one of “Two Old Mens tales” by the author of Emilia Wyndham.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I read it 25 years ago &amp; was deeply interested. I picked it up the other day, &amp; was almost equally affected: it is very powerful &amp; very true. I can send it you (ends badly)</p>
<p>I see M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Caul &amp; Manchester have fairly ridden down poor Natal, about the Hare &amp; I cannot but think that their answers will be considered triumphant by <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>9</mn><mn>10</mn></mfrac></math></formula> of readers.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Please return Haasts letter at your leisure.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>My boy Willy<ref target="#foot.f14"/> is at home now much the same as ever, very good &amp; good natured, happy &amp; amiable; but not strong &amp; very nervous— his mind is an utter vaccuum, he cares for no one thing, attends to nothing, &amp; regrets nothing. he is very young of his age. I do not think he made one single sensible observation throughout the journey— Charlie<ref target="#foot.f15"/> is as much the other way, overflowing with animal spirits, never says or does a foolish thing, &amp; is as amusing as a monkey &amp; knowing as a Yankee   he attracts a great deal of attention &amp; would be spoiled were he less sensible, or were his mind less occupied— he walks 10 miles without knocking up, &amp; is a keen observer and Collector— he must be very like what his grandfather Henslow was,<ref target="#foot.f16"/> &amp; I long to bring him to Down one day.</p>
<p>I am urging Oliver to take up Orchideæ,<ref target="#foot.f17"/> &amp; hope you will back me. I do not know an order in which there is more to do in every way, &amp; we sadly want an orchidologist. Lindly returns from Vichy today—no better either as to memory or the use of his hands.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>I have notice of Benguela temp. &amp; trop. form, it amounts to nothing per se (it was by Welwitsch).<ref target="#foot.f19"/>—but it is important as backing up the Cameroons migrations &amp; in reference to them. I am using it in the discussion.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>Planchon’s address is Prof. Bot. Montpellier<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>Your Oxalis is not in flower now with us, but is probably a Mexican species called <hi rend="underline">Deppei</hi>, I have ordered an eye to be kept upon it.<ref target="#foot.f22"/></p>
<p>I send Orchis seeds, (do you want pods too?)<ref target="#foot.f23"/></p>

<p>Lake Ohau   N. Zealand</p>
<p>December 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1862.</p>
<p rend="left">My dear D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker</p>
<p>Having hurt my right hand slightly by a fall with a horse, I have to employ one of my travelling companions to write this.<ref target="#foot.f24"/> I had the pleasure to receive here your letter of Sep<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. which like all your communications has given me infinite pleasure.<ref target="#foot.f25"/> I would have written to you sooner, had I not waited for the list of plants, promised to me in your letter of June.<ref target="#foot.f26"/> In the mean time I had the pleasure to send you two memoirs which will I hope interest you.<ref target="#foot.f27"/> You will find in them something more about the Physical geography of this island &amp; on my return to Christchurch in April I shall begin to write a more extended report with maps &amp; sections, illustrative of the Geology &amp; physical geography of this part of New Zealand.<ref target="#foot.f28"/></p>
<p>You see I am again in the Alps, reexamining some spots where the inclemency of the weather did not allow me to remain long enough before, and then I shall continue my researches towards the sourses of lakes Wanaka &amp; Hawea from the former reaching the west-coast to Jacksons Bay.<ref target="#foot.f29"/> I found a few glacial shells, but they were so rotten that I could make nothing of them but I know a spot where there are more to be had, &amp; I shall do my best to procure them. I discovered this latter spot only a few days ago, when on my road from Christchurch here. Amongst them a Mytilus in boulder clay, and if worth while, I shall send you my whole gathering, to have it examined.<ref target="#foot.f30"/> It also struck me forcibly that our glaciers are enormous, when considering the small size of the island the comparatively low elevation of the mountains &amp; the low latitude.</p>
<p>Have you not published your travels in India &amp; by what publisher?<ref target="#foot.f31"/> I should like very much to study your book if it is still to be procured. You are quite right in saying there are many reasons to deter you from coming to New Zealand, and I shall do my best to give you such accounts, that your interest in its physical geography &amp; natural productions, will not be diminished. The other day I again studied your ‘Flora’ &amp; observe that you describe the Discaria as being only a few feet high,<ref target="#foot.f32"/> but this is not always the case as in the valley of the Alps &amp; on the sides of the hills, I have seen it as high as 15 feet, having sometimes a knotty stem a foot in diameter. This spiney gentleman being called by the setlers ‘Wild Irishman’ with this gentle ascociate, aciphylla squarrosa, the ‘bloody spaniard’ of the setlers, forms some-times the only vegetation of these happy river beds, through which we had to wend our way, being hours in going one mile &amp; emerging again on better ground with torn clothes &amp; bleeding limbs.<ref target="#foot.f33"/></p>
<p>In coming here I made again a very striking observation viz. that travelling on the southern side of the Waitaki to this place &amp; crossing hills about 2200 feet high, not a single species of Celmisia was to be found, and only a yellow flowering Sinecio with white leaves whilst on the upper parts of the Canterbury plains, &amp; on the other side of the Pakaki river several species of the Celmisia are abundant, showing how local plants often are.</p>
<p>I have not yet seen Prof. Ramsay’s paper, but as my last case of books arrived as I left town, I shall read it on my return.<ref target="#foot.f34"/> The phenomenon that the Himalayan lakes lie only on the northern side whilst they are wanting on the southern, finds its counterpart in our Alps, but as the slopes of our Alps on their western side, are also narrow &amp; steep, our lakes lie on the eastern, which have shallow &amp; broad valleys; may this occurrance not offer us an easy explanation to this fact? A glacier on the steep side of a mountain will much sooner reach the foot, it cannot collect with others to form one large glacier, which by its compactness offers more resistance to the effect of the sun and atmospheric influences, in consequence the amount of detritus brought down, cannot be so great that it can form large terminal moraines, &amp; the valley being steep, the rush of the waters will soon destroy &amp; disperse this detritus, however large it may be and thus the first cause of the formation of lakes is destroyed.</p>
<p>I have not yet begun to study M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin’s new work,<ref target="#foot.f35"/> which will be a great treat for me on my return; he is a man after my own heart &amp; I do not recollect having enjoyed more intellectual pleasure, than when I began to peruse his wonderful work on the ‘Origin of species’, he has no more faithful disciple in the southern hemisphere than me &amp; I have made it my duty to combat the popular prejudices against this work, &amp; I dare say my voice has brought to the right path many an honest man who was seeking the truth on this important subject.<ref target="#foot.f36"/> I consider it the highest compliment you could pay me, in sending my letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.

<p>I am in hopes that the collection which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Harris takes with him to Europe for you will reach you in time, so that you may use them for your supplement.<ref target="#foot.f39"/> Already on the present journey I have collected a good many plants, some of which seem to me to be undiscribed, and this year I shall be in time in the Alps for the flowering season, so that I hope you will receive my new collection in time for your popular work on the N. Zealand Flora.<ref target="#foot.f40"/> You will have heard from the General Gover<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. of Auckland that the necessary money has been voted for the publication of this work,<ref target="#foot.f41"/> altho’ there was not the least doubt about it, our friend Monro<ref target="#foot.f42"/> being speaker of the house and the majority of the members men of good education, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Travers wrote separately to each member of our Province,<ref target="#foot.f43"/> &amp; I spoke to them personally before they left, all with one exception cordially entered into the subject, &amp; the only gentleman who was opposed to it, said that the great expenses of the Maori difficulty did not allow them at present to think of science for that Session.<ref target="#foot.f44"/> The consequence was that when I invited the most influential &amp; best educated members of the community, to join me for the formation of the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury,<ref target="#foot.f45"/> I purposely omitted him; Altho’ as I heard afterwards he did vote for the publication of the work. Altho’ he is one of our most influential men, this little lesson has done him good, and I could scarcely suppress a smile when he told me the other day, that in order to prepare himself to be elected a member of our Institute, he had bought some botanical handbooks to study the science.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure to receive the kind note of Sir W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. Hooker,<ref target="#foot.f46"/> for which you will thank him in my name</p>
<p>Our Provincial Agent M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. John Marshman 16 Charing Cross London will be happy to forward anything, entrusted to his care for me.<ref target="#foot.f47"/></p>
<p>I see my letter gets so long that I think it wrong to intrude further on your valuable time and hoping that you will continue to let me hear sometimes from you.</p>
