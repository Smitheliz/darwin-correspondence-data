                            <p>To the President of the French Republic: As foreigners, yet owing a debt of gratitude to France and to her people, some of us for long years of pleasant sojourn, some for equally pleasant journeys, some for life-long friendships, and all for treasures of thought and delight derived from her ample stores of literature, science, and art, we venture to apply to you, sir on behalf of a writer of whom we believe France to have reason to be proud, now lying under a heavy sentence. It is not for us here to express any opinion bearing on the internal politics of France. But we dare to think that the life of a man like Monsieur Élisée Reclus—whose already widely acknowledged services to literature and science did but promise, from the ripeness of his vigorous manhood, services more signal still for the future—belongs not only to the country which has given him birth, but to the world, and that in reducing such a man to silence, or sending him a prisoner beyond the pale of civilization, France will be but crippling herself, and diminishing her influence over the world.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Leniency, indeed, always becomes a victor; but how much more so when the victor is France, and among the vanquished is one of the young celebrities of French literature and science. Surely, sir, your own name is too illustrious, your place too eminent in the commonwealth of letters, to allow Monsieur Élisée Reclus' deportation to cast a blot on the literary renown of your great country. With fervent wishes for the prosperity of France, we are, &amp;c.,</p>

                <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_6592.xml">Élisée Reclus</ref> was a French geographer and anarchist. A supporter of the Paris Commune, he had been arrested in April 1871 and sentenced on 15 November 1871 to deportation to New Caledonia. In January 1872 the sentence was changed to simple banishment from France. (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9942.xml">Dunbar 1978</ref>, pp. 62–7.) After the text transcribed above, the article in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> noted that the memorial had received a number of notable signatures, including that of CD. However, Dunbar 1978 maintains that CD’s name was not on the petition (Dunbar 1978, p. 67). In February 1871, CD was evidently unaware of Reclus’s work (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-7500.xml">letter to Hermanus Hartogh Heijs van Zouteveen, 21 February 1871</ref>), although he arranged for Reclus to be sent a copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 8, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2681.xml">letter to John Murray, 3 February [1860]</ref> and n. 3).</note>
