                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I have been beguiling a solitary afternoon by a ramble amongst orchises: and if man has wholly displaced vegetables, please burn my note without reading it.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But at any rate here is my little fact about Ophrys apifera, simply confirmatory of what you have said.— I have examined this afternoon 106 growing and well opened flowers of this Ophrys. In none were both pollinia removed: in only three out of the 106 was one pollinium gone. In most of the older flowers the pollinia, one or both, were attached to the stigma: but sometimes over one another; sometimes across each other, not always, or perhaps generally, exactly where they seem meant to fall.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Another fact is curious &amp; seems to point to distribution by seed from a centre. The other orchids—G. Conopsea—very abundant. Orchis maculata—O. pyramidalis—O. ustulata—Habenaria Chlorantha— Cephalanthera grandiflora, are scattered singly &amp; promiscuously here &amp; there over the turf &amp; banks.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Ophrys apifera is always in groups—so that one may look over an acre of likely ground &amp; find none, &amp; then find a dozen plants within 3 or 4 feet— It is quite curious how regularly this is the case. I sometimes thought I had found a solitary one, but was sure on looking further to find some more within a yard or two if not nearer. I must have found from 200 to 300 plants open &amp; unopened, in not more than 20 or 25 groups</p>
<p>I trust you are well &amp; strong—and again at work—</p>
<p>Believe me | Very truly yours | T H Farrer</p>
<p>I must tell you another fact, which I came on accidentally the other day because it seems to point to easy change of instinct &amp; habit in birds.</p>
<p>In most of the places in London where there are ducks, there are islands where they can build in their own natural way without danger from boys. 〈On〉 the Serpentine<ref target="#foot.f5"/> there are no islands—and the fenced in shrubberies are small protection. The ducks in Kensington Gardens consequently have taught themselves to build in the tall old elms— And when the ducklings are ready the old duck turns them out, rolls them 〈    〉n so as best to break the fall, and carries them off unhurt to the water. My authority is the gardener who lives in the pretty lodge in the Middle of the Garden,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; he was confirmed, without concert, by his man, whom I found on the spot &amp; examined. The gardener told me he had seen an old duck a week or two since get out a brood of 12 or 13 i〈n〉 this way, carrying down the “reekling” or youngest in her bill.</p>
<p>They shew you the trees in which the ducks have now thus built for years.</p>
<p>Valeat quantum.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I believe the fact to be true</p>
