<p>You must excuse this dirty outside sheet of paper which has been polishing a table for the last week as it is the only one that I have, &amp; I write having nothing to say as you profess to like receiving any thing that pretends to be a letter.</p>
<p>At y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> demonstrations this morning who should I see walk in but Smith the pleasant looking clerk of Graham<ref target="#foot.f1"/> in the hospital, &amp; at the Anatomical Lecture he came &amp; sat by me and entered into conversation. He said that he was come to London &amp; knew nobody &amp; that knowing my face so well he felt quite an old acquaintance I said I felt just the same &amp; so we struck up a friendship &amp; went and dined together at a french house and afterwards went for a lounge to Armstrong<ref target="#foot.f2"/> who gave I think the very best lecture I ever heard here he met with to his great joy an Edinburgh friend who also seems a very decent sort of person. Long y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> friend of Hodson is I find Surgeon to the Lock Hospital &amp; also that he was a pupil of Laenec<ref target="#foot.f3"/> which may give him some right to give himself airs. Smith &amp; I did not quite agree about D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Graham he called him a <hi rend="underline">charming</hi> person, of all epithets in the world, but I made him agree with me in the detail that a great deal of his practice was bad &amp; his manners harsh.</p>
<p>There certainly must be some radical difference in the London &amp; Edinburgh lectures, for I can attend four hours in the day without the least weariness: the students are no comparison better behaved than on the other side of the Tweed, the other day Mayo<ref target="#foot.f4"/> got animated about some old bones &amp; kept on for an hour &amp; a half without the slightest symptom of impatience being shown. I have not heard a single scrape &amp; excepting at the close of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> opening lecture no applause. I went &amp; lionisized St Bartholomew with Moor which is really worth seeing it appears to be so well conducted. He seems quite at home &amp; very well acquainted with the patients, one poor dropsical wretch in particular to my astonishment who seemed more dead than alive &amp; had been tapped that day got quite amused by listening to him &amp; complained that he made her wish to laugh.</p>
<p>The dissection is going on languidly there is but one subject come in yet &amp; there are six engaged before the one I have put my name down to: they are cheap compared with Edinburgh being £8"8 which however when it comes to be multiplied three or four times is a heavy draw back.</p>
<p>Let me hear your Edinburgh plans when you have fixed them.</p>
<p>Good Bye.—</p>
<p>P.S. Lataika<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Snuff is all the go: shall I send you a packet per coach?</p>
