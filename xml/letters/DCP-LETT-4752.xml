<p>I thank you for your very interesting letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have the true English instinctive reverence for rank &amp; therefore liked to hear about the Princess Royal.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You ask what I think of the Duke’s address<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; I shall be glad to tell you.</p>
<p>It seems to me <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> clever like every thing that I have read of his; but I am not shaken; perhaps you will say that neither gods nor men could shake me. I demur to the Duke reiterating his objection that the brilliant plumage of the male humming bird could not have been acquired through selection, at the same time entirely ignoring my discussion (p. 93 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> Edition) on beautiful plumage being acquired thro’ <hi rend="underline">sexual</hi> selection.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The Duke may think this insufficient, but that is another question. All analogy makes me quite disagree with the Duke that the differences in the beak, wing &amp; tail are not of importance to the several species.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> In the only two species which I have watched, the difference in flight &amp; in the use of the tail was conspicuously great.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>The Duke who knows my orchis book so well might have learnt a lesson of caution from it, with respect to his doctrine of differences for mere variety or beauty.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> It may be confidently said that no tribe of plants presents such grotesque &amp; beautiful differences which no one until lately conjectured were of any use; but now in almost every case, I have been able to shew their important service.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that with humming birds or orchids a modification in one part will cause correlated changes in other parts.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I agree with what you say about beauty. I formerly thought a good deal on the subject &amp; was led quite to repudiate the doctrine of beauty being created for beauty’s sake.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I demur also to the Duke’s expression of “new births”:<ref target="#foot.f11"/> that may be a very good theory but it is not mine,—unless indeed he calls a bird born with a beak <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>100</mn></mfrac></math></formula> <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of an inch longer than usual “a new birth”; but this is not the sense in which the term w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> usually be understood.</p>
<p>The more I work the more I feel convinced that it is by the accumulation of such extremely slight variations that new species arise. I do not plead guilty to the Duke’s charge that I forget that natural selection means only the preservation of variations which independently arise.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have expressed this in as strong language as I could use; but it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have been infinitely tedious had I on every occasion thus guarded myself. I will cry “peccavi”<ref target="#foot.f13"/> when I hear of the Duke or you attacking Breeders for saying that man has made his improved Shorthorns or Pouter-pigeons or Bantams. And I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> quote still stronger expressions used by agricuturalists. Man does make his artificial breeds, for his selective power is of such importance relatively to that of the slight spontaneous variations. But no one will attack Breeders for using such expressions, &amp; the rising generation will not blame me.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Many thanks for your offer of sending me the Elements;<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I hope to read it all, but unfortunately reading makes my head whiz more than any thing else. I am able most days to work for 2 or 3 hours &amp; this makes all the difference in my happiness.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I have resolved not to be tempted astray, &amp; to publish nothing till my Vol. on Variation is completed.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>You gave me excellent advice about the foot-notes in my Dog chapter,<ref target="#foot.f18"/> but their alteration gave me infinite trouble, &amp; I often wished all the Dogs &amp; I fear sometimes you yourself in the nether regions.</p>
<p>We (dictater &amp; writer) send our best love to Lady Lyell<ref target="#foot.f19"/> | yours affectionately | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>If ever you sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. speak with the Duke on the subject please say how much interested I was with his Address &amp; tell him about Sexual Selection.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Campbell argued that the variations in bills, wings, and tails of humming-birds were not such as to give competitive advantage in the struggle for existence (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1186.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">G. D. Campbell 1864</ref>, p. 281): ‘It seems rather to have been a rule having for its object the mere multiplying of life, and the fitting of new forms for new spheres of enjoyment, according as these might arise out of corresponding changes in other departments of the organic world’.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Against the view that natural structures were created for the sake of beauty or variety, CD argued in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, pp. 346–60, that the unusual or beautiful forms of the orchid flowers facilitated pollination by insects.

According to this principle, when slight variations occur in one part of an organism, and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts of the organism are modified.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 199, CD briefly discussed the question of beauty in relation to selection, stating: ‘[some naturalists] believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man, or for mere variety. This doctrine, if true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory.’ The discussion of beauty is expanded in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6017.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> 4th ed.</ref>, pp. 238–41. CD began to make notes on differing ideals of beauty in humans and on mate selection between 1838 and 1840 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5912.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Notebooks</hi></ref>, Notebook D, 99; Notebook M, 32; Notebook N, 26–9; and Old and useless notes, 8, 14, 22–4; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_382.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Barrett 1980</ref>).

In this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds.’ He also gave numerous examples of animal breeders who habitually spoke of an animal’s organisation as something they could ‘model almost as they please’ (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 31).</note>
