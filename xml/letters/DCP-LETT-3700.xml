<p>We thank you sincerely for your heart-felt sympathy.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> We have had a bad time of it; but Emma is nicely recovering, &amp; came down to the drawing room for a little bit to day.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> She had considerable fever. Leonard travelled too soon, &amp; was injured by the journey.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Poor little fellow, he has been so patient during all his terrible illness; he will be months before he will be strong. We hope to move to Bournemouth in about a week, if both patients go on well.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Elizabeth Wedgwood is here, &amp; has been, as usual, the most unselfish &amp; devoted of nurses.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Horace is going on well &amp; only occasionally has a baddish day.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Etty<ref target="#foot.f8"/> is accustoming him to have no one to sit with him at night; &amp; she has so much judgment &amp; kindness, that she will do it well. It is a horrid bore, but we have been forced to engage a second house at Bournemouth, &amp; so shall not be all together.— Emma sends her love &amp; will write when she is strong: she hopes that Horace will soon be able to do some lessons, &amp; then it will be capital for him to have you to return. But I hope we shall then have got him out of his invalid habits. Poor little man he has often cried, when he has tried &amp; failed to write to you. And no wonder for nothing could have possibly exceeded your kindness to him.— What a wretched summer &amp; spring we have had! We had a very nice letter lately from Louisa, written with so much feeling.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I fear some things are very uncomfortable at the school; but she seems determined to bear them with excellent spirit. I sincerely hope that you have been happy &amp; enjoyed yourself at home with as few drawbacks as this weary world permits.</p>
<p>My dear Miss Ludwig— Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Ludwig’s letter has not been found. Ludwig, the Darwins’ governess, was on an extended visit to her family in Hamburg, having apparently been sent away in early June, on full pay, in order to separate her from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1226.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Horace Darwin</ref>. The Down surgeon, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1514.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Stephen Paul Engleheart</ref>, was concerned that Horace’s attachment to her might be exacerbating the illness from which he had been suffering.
