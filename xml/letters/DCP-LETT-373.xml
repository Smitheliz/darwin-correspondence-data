<p>I have delayed writing to you, to thank you most sincerely, for having so effectually managed my affair.</p>
<p>I waited till I had had an interview, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.— He appointed to see me this morning, &amp; I had a long conversation with him, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Peacocke being present. Nothing could be more thoroughly obliging &amp; kind that his whole manners.— He made no sort of restriction, but only told me to make the most of money, which of course I am right willing to do.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I expected rather an awful interview, but I never found anything less so in my life. It will be my fault if I do not make a good work; but I sometimes take awful fright I have not materials enough.— It will be excessively satisfactory at the end of some two years to find all materials made the most they were capable of.—</p>
<p>I received the box with the fungus &amp; peat plant.— I could find out nothing about the latter at the Linnæan Society but M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Bennett at the British Museum,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> soon made it out. It is <hi rend="underline">Astelia</hi> (?) <hi rend="underline">pumila</hi> of Brown.— <hi rend="underline">Anthericum trifarium</hi> of Solander.— I really hope in the course of a week to have some proof sheets, but there has been an unavoidable delay on the part of the printers.</p>
<p>I saw Leonard Jenyns on Monday and had a walk about the streets with him, &amp; had a great deal of talk about all sorts of things. I wish I may be able to go to Liverpool;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> there will be so many there, whom I should like to meet. But if it delays my book a week nothing shall induce me to go, for I do long to see it printed &amp; done for.—</p>
<p>The next time you hear from me, probably it will be with a proof sheet.— I must once again thank you my dear Henslow. You have been the making of me, from the first. I never should cared much for Natural History if it had not been for your friendship, when I was at Cambridge. You helped to keep me up to the mark all the yoyage, &amp; now you have completed the whole, by helping me to make the most of the results.— If it had not been for you <hi rend="underline">alone</hi> I should never have got the 1000£. My dear Henslow, I am most truly obliged.</p>
<p>Chas. Darwin</p>
