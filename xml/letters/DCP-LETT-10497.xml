<p>CD sends the gist of an extremely negative report from the [Royal Society’s] physiological referee on the value of RLT’s modifications of Brücke’s process for isolating pepsin [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">10470</hi>].</p>

<p>I have at last heard about the Physiological Referee, but my informant was directed <hi rend="underline">not</hi> to communicate to me the exact language, but only the sense of the Referee’s report.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I will now copy what my informant says:—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>“The referees report that the modifications which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> L. T has introduced into Brücke’s process for isolating pepsin consist in neglecting certain precautions without which the method is useless.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He relies on neutralisation for separating his <hi rend="underline">droserin</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> This process can have no diagnostic value, seing that innumerable substances would behave in this manner. The hygroscopic quality of his azein on which he insists is also unimportant since it is common to many derivitives of proteids, ex: gr. peptones<ref target="#foot.f5"/>   His method of determining the nature of the acid by comparative trials is valueless, because he has reduced them to a standard strength &amp; Brücke has shown that different acids act equally effectively at <hi rend="underline">different</hi> strengths. His method however of estimating the degree of acidity of the different acids is in itself defective in the absence of any evidence as to the purity &amp; constant quality of the litmus used”.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am extremely sorry to be compelled to convey the above information to you my dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">After the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4110.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Royal Society of London</ref> had rejected his paper on the tropical pitcher-plant, <hi rend="italic">Nepenthes</hi>, Tait asked CD about the objections of the physiological referee (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10473.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Lawson Tait, 25 April [1876]</ref>).

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Tait had used Brücke’s process to isolate a nitrogenous substance in the digestive fluid of <hi rend="italic">Nepenthes</hi> that he named droserin (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 23, first letter from Lawson Tait, 12 June [1875]). The paper he submitted to the Royal Society has not been found, but Tait later described his modification of the process and his method of neutralisation in a paper on the digestive principles of plants that was published in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Birmingham Philosophical Society</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8616.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">L. Tait 1879</ref>, pp. 126–7).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Azerin was a second digestive fluid isolated by Tait; according to Tair, dried azerin could absorb more than forty times its bulk of water from the air (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 23, letter from Lawson Tait, 16 November [1875]). Proteids was the term used in Britain from 1871 to designate protein bodies or substances after it had been shown that there were more than one, but in Germany the term was used to signify more complex protein compounds; the confusion continued until 1907, when, on the recommendation of the Committee on Proteid Nomenclature, ‘proteins’ replaced ‘proteid’ as the term for protein bodies (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5936.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">OED</hi></ref> s.v. protein). Proteins that can be broken down by gastric juices form peptones, which are then absorbed. <hi rend="italic">Ex: gr. (exempli gratia)</hi>: for example.</note>
