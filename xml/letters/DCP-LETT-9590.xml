<p>I have read over &amp; weighed very carefully what you say, &amp; agree in the main.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I send a proposed <hi rend="underline">fair</hi> copy &amp; if it quite meets your views, send it off; but the Review does’nt appear till <hi rend="underline">15</hi><hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Oct, &amp; was only published on 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. July so do not hurry. I still feel the introductory passage about licentiousness quite as offensive as the ‘prostitution’ one:— by the bye, thro’out y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. note you speak of the licentiousness as <hi rend="underline">the</hi> offence, but you clearly mean the latter.— The fact that the word <hi rend="underline">theoretical</hi> is introduced, (where it is almost meaningless,) makes to my reading of it, but little difference.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>My present plan you see is to omit this quotation from myself &amp; begin where you propose; thus giving chief prominence to what you consider the chief offence, whilst not omitting what seems to me equally offensive</p>
<p>I explained my reasons for not omitting the allusion to ‘offensive laws’ in my last.—and I fancy I can justify my reading of this Reviewer as the correct one—&amp; therefore my reasons are unchanged.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have written a few words in <hi rend="underline">red</hi> in y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Murray letter;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> for it looked to me rather too much as if you identified Murray with his Editor<ref target="#foot.f6"/>—but of course it is a mere suggestion on my part. I suppose you have quite made up y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. mind that you are justified in splitting with Murray if he does not consent to put the extremest pressure on the Editor. Of course y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. letter says, “get the letter inserted or either I or the Editor must cease to deal with you”.—</p>
<p>In all human prob. I shall come down by the 3.15 Exp. on <hi rend="underline">Monday</hi> B’stoke 5.27—as the Litches will be away. &amp; I shall only stay if I ca’nt see D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. C on Monday; so I sha’nt telegraph if I ca’nt get away fr. London but shall come by same train on Tuesday.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>It is curious what an utter revulsion my attack has made in me. I ca’nt perceive that I’m either full of mucous or bile, have no tendency to sickness &amp; very little flatulence, but my water has become thick after being clear for months &amp; my digestion is bad in an entirely different way &amp; I feel weak beyond anything—utterly languid at least in the afternoons. There’s no knowing however what tomorrow may bring</p>
<p>I’ve been writing a review of the obnoxious article (not of that part of course) wh. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to read to you &amp; wh. I fully expect you’ll tell me to chuck in the fire—&amp; I shall take y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. advice!</p>
<p>I had begun doing a little math<hi rend="superscript">cs</hi> last week but it’s gone from me again now &amp; I ca’nt tackle it again just yet.</p>
<p>I almost fear my Lake visit to the Cookson will have to fall thro’— the last great effort I made viz Holland, was such a fiasco<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I do hope my letter <hi rend="underline">nearly</hi> meets y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. views—but I’ll go on changing &amp; paring if you like</p>
<p>Yours affectionately | G H Darwin</p>

<p>I write to beg you, as an act of justice, to have inserted verbatum, in a conspicuous place in the next number of the Quarterly Review, the enclosed letter to the Editor from my son Mr George Darwin.</p>
<p>I further beg you to let me have an answer as soon as you conveniently can, in order that my son, if you refuse this request, may take any steps in his power by legal or other means to rebut the false and calumnious accusation made against him. I am further very anxious, on my own account to receive your answer as most unfortunately for me, if you determine that my son’s letter shall not appear, our relations must change. I think you will see that I have no choice on this head, if you will put yourself in my position, and imagine me to be the proprietor of a review in which according to your own judgment and that of all the friends whom you had consulted, a calumnious and groundless attack on your son had appeared and no reparation was granted. In this case you would I feel sure, no longer treat me as your friend, and you would free yourself at the earliest possible period from all business transactions with me. I have written to you not to the Editor, as I cannot expect fair treatment from him, after his employment of a gentleman to review my Descent of Man, who was notoriously pledged by two previous publications to review me in a hostile spirit.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Anxiously waiting for your answer I remain my dear Sir, | Your’s faithfully | Charles Darwin.</p>
<p>P S. The delay in my son’s letter to the Editor has been caused by my having first heard of the article on the 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. of July when I informed my son of it at Cambridge. We had then carefully to compare the article with the Review, and both of us to consult friends, so that we might feel certain that there was no shadow of an excuse for the imputation.</p>
<p>If you have time to spare I should be glad if you would read in the spirit of a Judge on the Bench my son’s essay, and see how absolutely groundless is the one odious charge of which we complain.</p>
