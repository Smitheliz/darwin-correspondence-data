                    <p>Now we are old friends! If we only take days for years—a method of computation which would not make much difference in the sum total of the geological epoch during which we live—that would not be very far removed from the literal truth. At any rate we may accept it for such, and believe in it.— I little thought that you were to be enumerated amongst the class of invalids; and I well know how uncertain ones motions and intentions are made by uncertain health. But I will cherish the hope which you hold out that I may possibly see you at Worthing some time in the course of next summer accompanie by M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> If you could upon consideration make this house your hotel, I would give a <hi rend="underline">carte blanche</hi> to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin to order, direct, and be absolute mistress of the household, as if you were really at home. Down stairs I live in a library and small dining room opening into one another; so that you could take to one and the other, on and off, alone or in company just as you pleased; and upstairs two bed rooms; one with a dressing room attached which my brother &amp; his wife, and other married couples, have frequently occupied. However there is time for you to think of that. Before then I dare say that some of your sons will come and see me; and that brings me to the object of this letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>On Friday next a friend is to pay me a visit. He will stay in all probability till the Monday, or possibly Tuesday following. After that date the room will be at the disposal of any one of your sons, who may feel inclined to pass a few days with me. Unfortunately I have only accommodation for one at a time, who will have to find his own amusements; not so easy perhaps at this period of the year. But it might be convenient to one to come round this way when he quits you.</p>
                    <p>The number of years that have passed over my head incapacitate me, of course, from joining in out door exercise with others. But when my liver (my great enemy) does not worry, I retain a sufficiency of youthful mind not to become oppressive to my guests; at least I hope so. Last year I could have offered them a cob &amp; pony chair to ride or drive; but I gave it up in the Spring.— My college was Caius. I receive an invitation every year to dine with the members of the boat club on the evening preceding the University race; but as I have never been at Cambridge since I took my B.A. degree I am sorely puzzled to guess who it is that has found me out and sends it.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Professor Huxley came to me Friday evening, arriving at 7. P.M. in the dark, and going back the next morning at 10 A.M.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Was not that act of stupendous good nature! All this merely to say that I shall be happy to see either of your sons whenever they like to come. I am ashamed of myself and hope that I have not worried you.</p>
