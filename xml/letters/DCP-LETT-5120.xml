<p>Thanks for criticism of proofs of his paper [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">5117</hi>].</p>  
<p>Not sure whether CD believes in reversion and would like a positive statement as this is the one point C. V. Naudin especially observed. Naudin offers his remarks on ovules as a matter to be proved ["Nouvelles recherches sur l’hybridité", <hi rend="italic">Nouv. Arch. Mus. Hist. Nat.</hi> 1 (1865): 25–176].</p>

<p>Very many thanks for your kindness in looking over the proof &amp; for your valuable criticisms.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I cannot make out however, whether <hi rend="underline">you</hi> believe in the fact of <hi rend="underline">reversion</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Of course on the whole of this subject, <hi rend="underline">I</hi> personally have no opinion to offer at all: as I am simply endeavouring to arrive at the present position of the subject from various authors:—&amp; as to <hi rend="underline">reversion</hi>, came to the conclusion stated in my paper, from the various works on the subject. If however <hi rend="underline">you</hi> think it a fact, I will modify my state<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi>. accordingly (without, of course, alluding to you)</p>
<p>I should be much obliged, however, if you would kindly give me your positive opinion on that point: as it is a very important one, since it is <hi rend="doubleUnderline">the</hi> one Naudin especially observed.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>the 3 passages you marked as “obscure” oddly enough, were all quotations from <hi rend="underline">Berkeleys</hi> Translations in Journal of Hort: Soc: Jan/66   I have endeavoured to elucidate them, as far as I can.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I have felt <hi rend="underline">immense</hi> difficulty in drawing up this paper, as I have not had a <hi rend="underline">scrap</hi> of experience of my own—so that I greatly feared it would be defective, yet, as you kindly suggest, if it call attention to the subject that is all I can desire or wish to expect.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>If you would give me y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> opinion on “<hi rend="underline">reversion</hi>” as soon as possible I will be much obliged.</p>
<p>I have looked at Naudin’s remarks on “<hi rend="underline">ovules</hi>”. &amp; find it to be correct— Offered, however, as a matter to be provd. (p 181–2: in Nouvelles recherches sur l’hybridite)<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>

He also discussed the sporadic appearance in domestic pigeon breeds of features characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon as an example of reversion (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 159–61).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">In his paper, Henslow discussed work by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3492.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Victor Naudin</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5806.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Naudin 1858</ref>, 1863, and 1864) that argued that all hybrids inevitably reverted to their parent forms; Henslow concluded: ‘Naudin’s experiments … have very satisfactorily shown that reversions do take place, at least amongst cultivated plants; though it would seem to occur rarely among individuals in a wild state’ (Henslow 1866b, p. 313). Henslow remarked that, as Naudin had failed to protect his hybrid plants from insects, the possibility that they were pollinated by the parent forms remained open. Henslow also criticised Naudin for having worked exclusively with cultivated plants, in which characteristics were less stable than in wild forms (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 311–13). CD had previously criticised Naudin’s experiments for ignoring insect agency (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3628.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 30 [June 1862]</ref> and n. 11, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 12, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D.
