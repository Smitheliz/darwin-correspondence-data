<p>Mrs Lyell has asked me to help her with an inscription for Lyell’s slab in Westminster Abbey.—such as Stanley may approve.— (I have fainted away twice)—</p>
<p>She sends me two, neither of which I like, I enclose them.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have asked for some days to consider, &amp; the longer I do so the more awful the task appears</p>
<p>How would it do to suggest something of this sort.</p>

<p>I am on two days visit to a place I had not seen since I was here with Fanny Henslow in 1847!. I cannot tell you how depressed I feel at times. She, you, &amp; Oxford are burnt into my memory.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Harriet went through the honor of the R. S. Conversazione admirably, but was quite knocked up, &amp; is tired out ever since.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I left her at Sir G. MacLeay’s<ref target="#foot.f5"/> yesterday, &amp; came on here for two days, I return to Kew tomorrow, but leave again soon, as I have promised to join the Cotswold field club next week.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Vigner has separated the digestive principle from Nepenthes &amp; proved it’s properties!.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> He finds Lawson Tait all wrong.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I now want him to find out whether this principle is poured into the pitcher before animal matter is put into it.—</p>

The conversazioni were exhibitions of scientific discoveries, artefacts, and art works held at the society’s headquarters in Carlton House Terrace. Inviting women was part of an initiative to hold more events at the Royal Society (Royal Society archives: soirée committee minutes, 1873–1977, CMB/84). For some years, two conversazioni were held a year; with refreshments provided and women invited to the second. Hooker, the president of the society, deplored the holding of ‘more parties’ but did not mind women being invited so long as the invitation list was limited to persons with serious scientific interests or a very close connection to a scientific worker (Royal Society archives: <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter from J.
