            <p>Reports the recent events of the Civil War.</p> 
<p>[Note on verso of envelope:] <hi rend="italic">Utricularia vulgaris</hi> is "about as neatly contrived for cross-fertilisation by insects as almost any <hi rend="italic">orchid</hi>".</p>

<p>Many thanks for your long and interesting letter of June 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, &amp; later.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Pray write upon thinner paper, and then one of the long letters which I find so enjoyable and so stimulating, will cost you only 1/ in postage.</p>
<p>The word <hi rend="underline">postage</hi> reminds me of your young son’s request (I do hope he has quite recovered his health), which shall surely be attended to.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Some young people here, of Mrs. Gray’s family take to stamp-collecting, and will help. They s〈ay〉 Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. Express 〈are〉 most rare. I never 〈saw〉 them. But we will 〈    〉 <hi rend="underline">Blood</hi>,—a Philadelph〈ia〉 〈    〉 penny-post carrier, is more common. I used to see his stamp upon my Philadelphia letters, and I think I may find or procure them. And for the rest, is it our U.S. stamps on letter envelopes your boy wants? I enclose a 3 cent, and will lay hold of the first one &amp; two cent ones that I see. I am glad if my off-hand orchid notes interest you, or prove of the least use..<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am daily expecting a copy to send you of my notice of the early chapters of your book. I will continue in the ensuing number.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> And whatever of the notes I send you seem 〈to〉 you worth touching upon, 〈you〉 have only to indicate 〈    〉 and send back my 〈memor〉anda, and I will take 〈    〉. But as to <hi rend="underline">Cypripedium</hi>, I should like to have an opportunity of examining them (except C. <hi rend="underline">acaule</hi>) more at large, and growing.</p>
<p>A week from to-morrow, I expect to be able to leave Cambridge.—to go down, with my examination-papers to read, to my <hi rend="underline">beau-pere’s</hi> place on the shore for a few days.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> There I will try to look up &amp; bring home living <hi rend="underline">Rhexia Virginica</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> and also I expect to have a look at <hi rend="underline">Calopogon pulchellus</hi> with its strong bearded labellum. And I hope it will not be too late to get plenty of <hi rend="underline">Mitchella repens</hi> which my pupils do not bring in as they ought.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I want to see if long-styled stigma &amp; short, differ, and also the pollen of the two, as they do in <hi rend="underline">Houstonia</hi>,—of which I hope I sent you Rothrock’s observations. At least I will send when he has completed them.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Meehan</hi>—a good gardener—send me his ms. before printing.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I tried to find exceptions to his rule, and thought I had; but he beat me down.</p>
<p>If any body comes out with a new empirical law, I always disbelieve him <hi rend="underline">prima facie</hi>. But Meehan is an honest and I suppose very good observer, and you may “<hi rend="underline">approximately</hi>” trust him, I should think.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> He may have got hold of something.</p>
<p>Precocious fertilization in the bud was much noticed here very long ago, by Torrey, in <hi rend="underline">Viola</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Specularia</hi>, &amp;c, &amp;c—<ref target="#foot.f11"/>also in Impatiens—about which see my Genera F<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>. vol. 2.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I once mentioned it to you as good evidence of <hi rend="underline">close-fertilisation</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> As to the pollen-tubes of such, I have no observations of my own, but a memory, or fancy, that they were shown to me by Torrey. I will ask him, and have him look at <hi rend="underline">Specularia</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>As to the French Lady’s translation and commentary on the Origin, I am not so much surprised.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> As I view it there are only two sides to the main question. Very likely she takes one side in a thorough-going and consistent manner; and either she is right, or I am right. I.e. there is design in nature or there is not. The <hi rend="underline">no-design</hi> view, if one can bring himself to entertain it may well enough lead to all she says, and we may very much admire how <hi rend="underline">collission</hi>, and destruction of least favored brings about apparently orderly results,—<hi rend="underline">apparent</hi> contrivances or adaptations of means to ends. On the other hand, the implication of a designing mind must with it a strong implication of design in matters where we could not directly prove it. If you grant an intelligent designer anywhere in Nature, you may be confident that he has had something to do with the “contrivances” in your Orchids.</p>
<p>I have just received and glanced at Bentham’s address, and am amused to see how your beautiful <hi rend="underline">flank</hi>-movement with the Orchid-book has nearly overcome his opposition to the Origin.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>The military simile above leads me to speak of your wonder that I can think of science at all in the midst of war.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> Well, 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> we get used to it. 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, We need something to turn to, and happy are they who, forbidden to engage personally in the 〈war〉 (as I am ever itching to do,〈)〉 have something to turn to.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. I do not do much.—do nothing in fact except my college duties now for months.—and that is the reason I have time to write to you, and be interested in all your doings.<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>If you suppose everything is paralysed and desolate here, and country greatly put back, read a very sensible letter of an Englishman in the <hi rend="underline">Spectator</hi> of June 7.<ref target="#foot.f20"/> It is very just &amp; true. We shall recuperate fast enough, and be better off than ever, as much prosperity as is good for us, and more sol〈id,〉 more independent, more sel〈f-〉contained,—which is our g〈reat〉 desideratum. <hi rend="underline">Free-tr〈ade〉 be blowed</hi>; we must nee〈ds have〉 high duties on imports; an〈d〉 〈    〉 that we should. By 〈th〉ese and by direct taxes—the 〈t〉ax-bill just passed—we shall have to <hi rend="underline">pay over</hi> largely.<ref target="#foot.f21"/> Very well.</p>
<p>Just at present our prospects (viz. evening of July 3) are looking badly enough. Mc’Clellan has clearly been over matched and driven to the wall, after very obstinate fighting with very heavy loss on both sides.<ref target="#foot.f22"/> Whether it is retrievable with reinforcements, or whether the whole campaign has to be begun again against Richmond is not yet clear. Anyway we have got to put shoulder to the wheel anew, and it may be done, we suppose, more easily, and far more 〈p〉romptly than last year. 〈All〉 we ask is that Europe shall 〈leave us〉 alone.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Gray refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1230.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Leonard Darwin</ref>. In the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3595.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 10–20 June [1862]</ref>, CD requested Gray’s assistance in procuring a number of North American postage stamps for Leonard’s collection, and told him that Leonard had become ill with scarlet fever.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD had assured Gray, who was concerned that his ‘scattering notes’ were tiresome, that he took ‘very great pleasure’ in Gray’s letters (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3595.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 10–20 June [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3588.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Asa Gray, [2 June 1862]</ref>). It is evident from CD’s reply to this letter (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-3662.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 23[–4] July [1862]</ref>) that Gray had sent with it ‘a bundle of notes’ on orchids; these notes have not been found.</note>

Gray wrote a follow-up article to his review for the November number of the journal (A. Gray 1862b). In the List of reviews (DAR 262 (DH/MS* 8: 6–18)) that served as CD’s index to his collection of reviews of his own books, there is an entry that reads ‘<hi rend="italic">Asa Gray</hi> On Orchids, Review of’.

Bentham concluded that while ‘Biology’, defined strictly as ‘the history of animal and vegetable life’ (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. lxviii), was ‘a field of inquiry comparatively untrodden’, the ‘remarkable success’ attending CD’s work ‘should stimulate others to follow in the same track’, (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. lxxxi). He continued: <quote type="quote"> I do not refer to those speculations on the origin of species, which have excited so much controversy; for the discussion of that question, when considered only with reference to the comparative plausibility of opposite hypotheses, is beyond the province of our Society.... But we must all admire that patient study of the habits of life, with that great power of combining facts, which has revealed to us so much of surprising novelty in the economy of nature. The wonderful contrivances for the cross-fertilization of Orchids, so graphically detailed in Mr. Darwin’s new work, and which rival all that had been previously observed in the singular economy of insect life, had been hitherto unsuspected even by those botanists who had specially devoted themselves to that family. </quote> Bentham had at first been ‘greatly agitated’ by <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 7, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2589.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D.

            <note xml:id="foot.f20">Gray refers to a letter from the new town of Lanark, Illinois, signed ‘An English Traveller’, claiming that ‘the great fact of American history’ was the progress westwards across the prairie represented by towns like Lanark, and that such progress was continuing, despite the American Civil War. The writer contrasted this with the ‘popular English view of American affairs’, that the ‘whole country’ was ‘in revolution’, that trade was bankrupt, and ‘the entire progress of the country stopped for years to come’ (<hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, 7 June 1862).</note>
