<p>I am sorry to hear about the Calls due, for I thought all had been paid up in <hi rend="underline">advance</hi>; some certainly was, as I remember requesting &amp; have received interest. But I have never received latterly any particulars, except of the <hi rend="underline">first</hi> great purchases, in the 4 Railways, in which Emma’s money is placed.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I do not understand, whether it is capital or interest, which you expect as perhaps coming in before this call of 45£ is due. It would require (supposing that the calls have not been already paid &amp; overlooked by the N.W. Railway, &amp; they are capable of mistakes, as I have just detected them in overcharging as they have acknowledged me 10£) 162£, besides the 45£ now due, to pay off the whole of these nine 25£. If capital was coming in, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be very glad to pay off all at once.— Otherwise of course I must pay the <hi rend="underline">calls</hi> myself, as they come due, for I cannnot advance 162 + 45 = 207£.— Please to let me know, when I must send the 45£.</p>
<p>Are you sure that I have <hi rend="doubleUnderline">nine</hi> shares of 25£; I never heard of it before, that I can remember:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Are you trustee for anyone else, who has shares in L. &amp; N.W. Railway? As I have said I have never received the later particulars of all the money invested in Railways in your &amp; Eras’ name’s:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have occasionally known that calls &amp;c have been paid, but not the precise sums &amp; dates: I have long been intending to ask you to let me know all the money thus invested with as full particulars as you know. It has occurred to me, as least trouble to you to copy out <hi rend="doubleUnderline">all</hi> that I have in my own Book,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> about Emma’s property, &amp; will you kindly make it complete.</p>
<p>Yours affect. | C. Darwin</p>
