<p>I have been for some time intending to write to you, but I have been partly too idle and partly too busy.— Henslow tells me he hears a groan occasionally escape from you, when you mention my fishes; I ought to feel very thoroughly ashamed at this, but I am so very glad that you have undertaken to do what you can, that I am hardly able to pity even your groans.— I would sooner all the fish had rotted, than M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gray<ref target="#foot.f1"/> described them &amp; with his exception, if you had not taken pity on them, they most surely would have remained for many a long year unlooked at and unnamed.— I understand, that you have made up your mind that some of the fish are undescribed.— If D’Orbigny’s Voyage<ref target="#foot.f2"/> is not in Public Library,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> you ought to urge M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lodge<ref target="#foot.f4"/> to get it; as it is most important work &amp; will certainly contain some of my fish, at least some from the Patagonian coast. The Coquille’s Voyage<ref target="#foot.f5"/> possibly may contain some from the Falkland Isl<hi rend="superscript">ds</hi>.— Henslow will deliver to you a portfolio of coloured drawings of fish, made for Capt. FitzRoy by the artists on board the Beagle.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>The locality of each is mentioned, it is just <hi rend="underline">possible</hi> that where only one of a marked genus occurs at a place you might be able to identify it, in which case we might have a coloured drawings.—</p>
<p>I will have any or all the fish you think new lithographed.— You need not be in any hurry about the fish (without you want to finish it &amp; say you have done all you can do) as the fish will be published last of the vertebrate animals.—</p>
<p>I will of course send you a copy of the firs〈t〉 number, when it appears in January:<ref target="#foot.f7"/> it will contain nothing but the description of Toxodon.—</p>
<p>I hear you have had a pony for some time, but that most unfortunately it has turned lame. I wish with all my heart I could see any near prospect of paying Cambridge &amp; you a visit, but you would be surprised to know how many minutiæ this Govermt work has entailed on me.— There will be no comfort in such undertakings, without a law is passed to empower naturalists every now and then to hang an artist for an example.—</p>
<p>Believe me, my dear Jenyns | Most truly Yours | Chas. Darwin.—</p>
