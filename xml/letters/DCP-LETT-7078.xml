<p>I am very glad to hear that you are pleased with the proofs; I suppose you will have the remainder in a week or two, &amp; I am looking forward for the appearance of your work with great impatience.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>You are very kind in asking after my boy; indeed, I should have added a line about him in my last note, only I thought you had to think about so many things that I would not intrude upon you with my domestic affairs.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Shortly after I had seen you my solicitor informed me that the Counsel of the Respondents finding their case unjustifiable, had refused to go on with it. Consequently the child had to be given up, &amp; the Court dispensing with my personal appearance, simply found the respondents liable into costs</p>
<p>It so happened that after the case had been settled, it came out that the same man who refused me my child, had persuaded my poor wife a few hours before her death behind my back, to ask me to send the child to Scotland! However, enough of it; the mere thought of such conduct makes me still very bitter. I have the comfort to know that there was no guile in my wife, &amp; I am justified in forgetting her relations.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>The boy is a fine strong child, doing very well under the faithful care of my mother,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; being a source of great comfort to me. Fathers, they say, are talkative about their youngsters; therefore I will not expose myself; there is nothing extraordinary about the boy except that he is born on the anniversary of the <hi rend="underline">death</hi> of Cuvier<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Yours faithfully | AG.</p>
