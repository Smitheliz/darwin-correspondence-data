<p>I have been writing an account of the worms at Abinger &amp; <hi rend="doubleUnderline">most</hi> useful I have found your notes.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> When my M.S. has been well copied, I will ask you to look it over, as you may detect some inaccuracies; it is only about a dozen pages.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I write now to ask 2 or 3 questions: is the concrete floor so well protected that it is quite dry? if not so, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. much like to hear whether castings are still ejected on it.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Secondly, in the Times it is said that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wright w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. publish an account of the ruins <hi rend="underline">with a plan</hi>: has this been done &amp; could you lend me the article &amp; plan?<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Thirdly you refer incidentally in one of your notes to some walk, the foundations of which consist of broken bricks &amp; mortar: now will you be so kind as to look at this walk, &amp; if the worms have thrown up any castings on it, to send me a few. I want to see whether the particles of brick have been at all tri-turated by the action of their muscular gizzards.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>Lastly I enclose extract from letter from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Torbitt, giving a grand account of his success.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Will you give me address of “<hi rend="doubleUnderline">J.</hi> ??? Caird Esq C.B”, as I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like also to send him copy of Torbitt’s letter, telling him, of course, that no answer was required.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>You will have heard that Elizabeth Wedgwood is very unwell, &amp; I cannot but think very seriously.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> My sister Caroline has also been unwell, &amp; had it not been for these two causes we sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. now have been at Leith Hill Place.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

H. Farrer, 23 September 1877</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"> CD published Farrer’s observations in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref>, pp. 186–8, and included further brief observations made on 25 September and 13 October 1877.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The excavation of the Roman villa had revealed the presence of a concrete floor still partly covered with small red tiles. CD at first doubted whether worms could have penetrated this floor; he assumed that the earth above it had been washed down from higher land, until he observed worm burrows forming on the freshly cleared surface of the floor (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref>, pp. 184–5).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">An article titled ‘Roman Villa at Abinger’, published in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 2 January 1878, p. 7, stated that plans of the villa and the paper by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8854.xml">George Robert Nicol Wright</ref> had been presented at a meeting of the British Archaeological Association and would be published at a later date. A report, ‘Recent discovery of the remains of a Roman villa at Abinger, Surrey’, was published in the <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi>, 5 January 1878, pp. 19–20, with some plans of the site on p. 20 and a statement that the paper by Wright would appear in the journal of the British Archaeological Association. Wright’s paper was not published.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Farrer had mentioned that plenty of wormcasts appeared on gravel paths laid with ‘beds of brick bat &amp; lime rubbish’ in his letter of <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11150.xml">23 September 1877</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 25). CD reported in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref>, p. 18, that little stones swallowed by worms served, like millstones, to grind their food.</note>
