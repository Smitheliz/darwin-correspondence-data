                    <p>Murray sent me the Life of Erasmus Darwin in due course, as you had kindly instructed him to do.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I spent the two last evenings in reading it through, and write at once to thank you for the book as well as your obliging recollection of me. It is full of pleasant and instructive reading; on both sides of it, your personal accounts, no less than D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Krause’s Summary of the doctrines contained in the various works of E. Darwin.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I had only known his name as a poet; and that, to confess the truth, only from Canning’s parody in the Anti Jacobin.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He must indeed have been a man of remarkable ability and originality of mind to have tapped, as it were, at the period when he lived the sources of knowledge which an equally gifted grand-son has spent an industrious life in investigating, correcting, expanding, and reducing to a system—by cumulative proofs deduced from all orders of nature, sufficient to convert bitter opponents, and satisfy the judgements of the first scientific enquirers of the day. It was well that you should set yourself to remove the slightest aspersion from a character like his.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> And, in the fulness of time, when another century has rolled on, I do not know what better wish one could breathe for you, than that another grandson of the family, another “younger Darwin” equal to the two elder ones, may come to the front, if necessary to see that no injustice is done to you. No man I apprehend of illustrious name can hope to pass away without being <hi rend="underline">pelted</hi> by some one—if only by a member of that “learned” body who persuade their penitents in Lent that “hog’s flesh is fish ever since the Devil entered into them and sent them rattling into the sea.”!—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> But this was to have been only a note of thanks, and I am prosing on much I fear to your tribulation. So good bye!, and <hi rend="underline">pardon</hi>! Yours very truly | Anthony Rich. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
<p rend="left">Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. 14— 79.</p>
                    <p>P.S. I have this moment remembered that you, or one of your sons, or some one else whom I have jumbled up by mistake, said that he could not find out when I was at Caius Coll: and I am so stupid about dates that I could not myself remember; which in these days of pretentiousness looked rather like being an imposter!—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> An old Cambridge Calendar tumbled out of one of my closets yesterday, by which I find that I went up as a freshman in Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. 1821, and took my B.A. degree in Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. 1825.—on the last day of which month I attained the age of 21.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD had promised to send Rich a copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2365.xml"><hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi></ref>, which was published by John Murray (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12298.xml">letter from Anthony Rich, 7 November 1879</ref> and n. 1). Rich’s name is on the presentation list for the book (Appendix IV).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi> contained a preliminary notice by CD and an essay by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2758.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ernst Krause</ref> on Erasmus Darwin’s scientific work that emphasised his contribution to evolutionary theory.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_820.xml">George Canning</ref>’s poem ‘The loves of the triangles’ (co-authored by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1756.xml">John Hookham Frere</ref>) was published in three issues of the weekly periodical <hi rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2674.xml">[Frere and Canning] </ref>1798). It was a parody of Erasmus Darwin’s poem <hi rend="italic">The loves of plants</hi> (part 2 of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1789.xml"><hi rend="italic">The botanical garden</hi> (E. Darwin 1799)</ref>). In <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>, p. 95, CD remarked that Canning’s parody caused the downfall of his grandfather’s fame as a poet.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD was highly critical of previous biographical accounts of his grandfather (see <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>, pp. 70–80, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11944.xml">letter to Ernst Krause, 19 March 1879</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11947.xml">letter to Francis Galton, 22 March 1879</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Rich alludes to the story of the Gadarene swine into which Jesus cast the demons that had possessed a man, resulting in the pigs’ running down a cliff into the sea; the story appears in the three synoptic gospels (Mark 5:1–20, Luke 8:26–39, and Matthew 8:28–34). See also <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>, p. 7.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Rich mentioned having attended <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_790.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Caius College</ref>, Cambridge, when George Darwin visited him in January 1879 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11824.xml">letter to W.
