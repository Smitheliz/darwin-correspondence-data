            <p>Thanks WALM for having sent interesting publications, especially the one on relation of structure of man to lower animals,</p>
            <p>and just a few days since, on protuberances on bird skulls. WALM’s facts on the latter subject have an important bearing on the acquisition of sexual characters. CD is pleased that the influence of sexual selection is admitted.</p>

<p>Permit me to trouble you with a few lines to thank you for your kindness in having sent me various interesting publications; especially one on the structure of man in relation to the lower animals, &amp; a second, received only a few days since, on the osseous protuberances of the skulls of Birds.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have been particularly glad to see this latter memoir, &amp; have seldom been more interested than by your statement that these protuberances appear early in life in those species in which both sexes are thus furnished, &amp; late in life in those in which the males alone possess them.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> This is a parallel case to that given by me in the Descent of Man about the horns of the Rein-Deer; &amp; I believe that the fact has a very important bearing on the acquisition of sexual characters.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>It has pleased me much to observe that you admit to a considerable extent the influence of sexual selection.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>With much respect &amp; my best thanks, I remain, Dear Sir | Yours faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD’s annotated copies of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5240.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Marshall 1870</ref> (on resemblances between humans and other animals) and 1872a (on bony protuberances on the skulls of birds) are in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL, together with papers sent by Marshall on elongated tail feathers in birds of paradise (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5241.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Marshall 1871</ref>), and general observations on birds’ tails (Marshall 1872b).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">See Marshall 1872a, p. 174; CD scored this passage three times in in his copy of the paper and wrote ‘very important’ in the margin.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD had proposed in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> that secondary sexual characteristics generally appeared later in life than characteristics that were shared by both sexes. He illustrated this with the case of reindeer, which develop antlers at an unusually early age and are the only members of the deer family in which females have antlers as well as males (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 1: 288, 295). CD added Marshall’s similar conclusions about birds to this section in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1967.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 235 and n. 43, citing Marshall 1872a; he also cited Marshall 1872a and 1872b in a discussion of the development of ornament, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5241.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Marshall 1871</ref> on moulting in birds of paradise (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1967.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, pp. 383–4 and nn. 65 and 66, 393 n. 82).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In his work on bony crests in birds, Marshall concluded that those found only in the males must often have arisen through sexual selection; he also suggested that some features that had arisen through sexual selection might not be easily identifiable as such, having assumed an additional function over time and lost their original role (Marshall 1872a, p. 174).</note>
