<p>I am heartily glad to hear of your accession of fortune; but I wish you would ‘take the goods the Gods provide you’ like a reasonable man; instead of immediately casting about to despoil yourself in favour of a friend, like a generous man, as I see you have been doing—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am very glad you have told me all about the matter so that I may speak freely in return   I quite enter into your feelings &amp; should act in the same way under like circumstances at least I hope I should, for the grasping avarice with which I have been credited lately leaves room for doubt— At the same time if you will put yourself in my place, you will feel that the notion that I or my belongings should in any way profit at the expense of you or yours—must be altogether repellent to me; and that I can but wish that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich should stand to his guns &amp; in spite of your rendered persuasions leave the provisions of his will untouched—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>If there are any ‘residuary’ crumbs left, as you hint, I shall not quarrel with them if they come my way; otherwise it is my earnest wish that the <hi rend="underline">status quo</hi> should remain unchanged— And the kindest thing you can do for me is to use your influence with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich in this sense—</p>
<p>Polly—that sagacious urhund<ref target="#foot.f3"/>—would howl at me if I came among you laden with the spoils of the clan Darwin—and we should feel worse fortune hunters than ever on our next visit to Heene—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>You will find the York address in ‘Nature’.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It seemed to go down very well—which I was glad of as I mean to retire from this line of business.</p>
<p>These addresses take so much out of one—</p>
<p>The wife sends her love &amp; says she is going to write to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin. She has been up Helvellyn &amp; if the Athletic sports were not over I should expect her to enter for them!<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In his letter of <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13324.xml">9 September 1881</ref>, CD had asked whether Huxley’s discourse, ‘The rise and progress of palaeontology’, presented at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in York, was going to be published in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>; it appeared in the issue for 8 September 1881, pp. 452–5.</note>
