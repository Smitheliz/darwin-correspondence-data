<p>I am much obliged for the letter which you have sent me in reply to the message which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Roberts was kind enough to convey from me— The letter is marked private &amp; confidential, &amp; I have endeavoured to respect your wishes in that matter So far as such a course may be consistent with justice to those concerned 〈    〉 〈    〉 with its contents.</p>
<p>You tell me that you now regret the publication of the attack on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> G. Darwin, &amp; that the impression made upon your mind by his article, &amp; under the influence of which you wrote, is not to be justified— And I gather that this regret &amp; conviction that your attack was not justifiable have existed in 〈    〉 〈    〉 mind for some months— in fact ever since the article was published.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, had I been in your position, there were two things I shd have felt it my duty to do. In the first place I should have written to Mr G. Darwin or to Mr D.— with whom you have been in friendly correspondence &amp; offered him the fullest &amp; frankest apology I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> put into words, &amp; in the second place, I 〈    〉 〈    〉 requested the Ed. of the 〈    〉 to insert a note fully &amp; fairly retracting all that c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be considered unjust &amp; therefore offensive to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. G. D—</p>
<p>You did neither of these things, &amp; when an apology was extorted from the J.— what appeared presumably with your sanction, if not from your hand, was a defence rather than a retractation.</p>
<p>Proceedings of this kind are not in accordance with what I understood to be the rules by which men sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> endeavour to guide their conduct— &amp; as I concur with Mr G. D that the charges made &amp; insinuated against him are, as he says “absolutely false”—it will be obvious to you that our views on those points which <hi rend="underline">I</hi> hold to be the most important of all to mankind, are too hopelessly divergent to readers familiar intercourse between us pleasant or adviseable</p>
<p>I am | Yours very truly | T. H. H—</p>
