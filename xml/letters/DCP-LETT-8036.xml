<p>I think that you should see enclosed.</p>
<p>I have at last driven Mr Gladstone into a corner, &amp; obliged him to take up my grievances.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I told you that he had forwarded my complaints against Mr Ayrton to the latter to be answered, &amp; he has sent me Mr Ayrtons in the form of a paper of explanations &amp; allowed me an opportunity of discussing them with his private Secretary as his representative—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have unhesitatingly pronounced Mr Ayrtons’s “explanations” to be “a tissue of evasions, misstatements &amp; misrepresentations” &amp; I further charge him with telling the Prime Minister a <hi rend="underline">direct</hi> <hi rend="underline">falsehood</hi>. I then proceeded to show how <hi rend="underline">all but</hi> impossible it is, that I should hold office under a Minister of whom I entertain and <hi rend="doubleUnderline">express</hi> these sentiments, &amp; whose conduct to me has been so ungracious &amp; offensive, &amp; whose acts I regard as so detrimental, &amp; subversive of discipline in this Establishment.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I further appeal to Mr Gladstone as the First Minister of the Crown, <hi rend="underline">by whom Mr Ayrton was set to rule over me</hi>!—to direct the latter to restore to me that authority &amp; those functions of a Director that his Minister has taken away.</p>
<p>So you see I am enjoying a good shriek at my Lords &amp; Masters—&amp; I rather enjoy tossing my horns against the Sun &amp; moon.</p>
<p>The Duke of Argyll<ref target="#foot.f4"/> has been <hi rend="underline">most</hi> kind about it. But the best part of the fun is,—only for Gods sake don’t let it escape you—that Lyell has—thanks to a certain Lady’s interference—written to Ld Granville, asking him to get Gladstone to confer Murchisons K.C.B. on me!<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I’d give a hundred pounds to see Gladstones face when this “obus”<ref target="#foot.f6"/> was dropped into the embroglio— it gives infinite zest to the whole proceeding. Of course Gladstone would rather give it to Ayrton than to such a <hi rend="underline">pestilent</hi> fellow as I am, who have continously worried him for 3 whole months. But how good of dear Lyell, &amp; how like him to cleave to an old friend. &amp; seek his honor when in Extremis. I am immensely touched by it—&amp; for his sake (not my own God knows) would have wished him success— As it is, <hi rend="underline">that</hi> incubus is now put off sine die. Lyell has, I know, done it by way of influencing Gladstone to my side in this pitiful quarrel with Ayrton, &amp; in that respect the application cannot but have <hi rend="underline">immense</hi> effect— in fact, if I beat Ayrton I shall rank Lyell’s shot as in the bull’s eye.— bless him.</p>
<p>A really very nice Book of Juke’s letters &amp;c has been published by his sister Mrs Browne.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> What I have read of it I like extremely— he was a grand fellow—full of genuine human nature—abounding sympathy &amp; generosity.</p>
<p>I followed dear old Murchison to the grave the other day, we shall never see his like again, &amp; shall miss him in many ways very much indeed.— though for my part more in the papers than in the flesh, for I hardly ever saw him during latter years. After a year or two there will have been a regular clearing out of the old philosophers all dying at a ripe old age.— Sedgwick has I see given up lecturing at last.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener><div type="transcription">
                     
<p>May I ask your sympathy with me in the following matter of which I write you with a deep sense of shame. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin my kind and generous benefactor is still my creditor for £120, which he so heartily gave to meet my requirements in coming to India and which he must now think has been bestowed to a most unworthy and ungrateful recipient.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> For years the thought of this has been with me an abiding sore. Long ago I wrote him hopeful that I would soon be able to refund all and then I should have felt free and happy.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Monetary difficulties which I shall take the liberty of explaining to you fell upon me; deeper and deeper I became involved. I was then altogether ashamed to write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin and thus for years and to my sorrow there has been a complete silence. Time after time have I sat down to break it and tell him how I was circumstanced; but never did the thought present itself than as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin personally knows really nothing of me he cannot but think that I would but thus avoid paying my debt to him. Thus has bad been made worse, and I do hope you will forgive me in troubling you in this matter and I do beg that you will kindly explain all to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin. Permit me now to explain the cause of all my difficulties. Very shortly after I had got my house furnished here and fairly settled a much respected friend of mine came to me one day and told me of some then temporary difficulty he had in some money matters and asked me to sign a bill for him which he assured me he would be able to meet when due.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> It proved otherwise he sustained further losses and the bill fell upon me. I was unable to pay and had to borrow money at high interest to prevent my complete ruin and only now D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker can I say that I have paid all up—stock and interest. After about seven years of Indian service I thus begin as I began which is a very grievous and hard thought. However I can say this that my friend did not make me a mere tool, he I am convinced honestly believed that I would never be called upon to pay it; though certainly it was wrong in him to make use of me and still more foolish and inconsiderate was it in me to sign bills which I knew I could not pay. It has been altogether a sad and painful lesson; but I have at least prospects of recovering a portion at least of what I have lost on his account as through the support of some of his old friends at home he is likely to get into a fair line of business. It has been thus through all these years I have struggled on under monetary difficulties, known only to my friend and the money lender. To you alone have I broken it and I do beg that you will explain to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin the cause of my silence and that I am still ever grateful to him. Henceforth my sole aim shall be (and this will prove more than words) to save the amount due by me to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin to which it is but simple justice that I should add interest which I shall do according to current rates in the Bank of Bengal. When I have this done my heart shall find that which it has not known for years.</p>
<p>Begging again Dr. Hooker that you are not offended with me in writing to you as I have done and that with shame and pain I assure you I shall anxiously await your reply.</p>
<p>I am | Dear Sir, | yours truly, &amp; obliged | John Scott</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">P.S.</hi> | Would you kindly inform me also what is doing with my Fern-paper. Dr. Anderson told me that it had been passed for the Transactions.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> About the plates which the Society object to pay for and if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Fitch can undertake them for about £20 I would send the amount on hearing from you.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I shall be very thankful to you for any advise. | J Scott</p>
