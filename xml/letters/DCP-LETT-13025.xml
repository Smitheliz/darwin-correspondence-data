                    <p>I have had great pleasure in signing your son’s certificate &amp; have handed it on to Judds Assistant for him to do the like when he comes<ref target="#foot.f1"/>   No doubt you will get it tomorrow</p>
                    <p>I have accepted the Fishery Inspectorship but I am not yet officially appointed   I suspect, but don’t know that there has been a battle between the Home Secretary &amp; the Lord President on my side &amp; the Treasury, on the other, about some details.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I had never so much as thought of the appointment but Harcourt wrote me a very considerate letter to the effect that he had made up his mind if ever he had the power to do something to improve the position of men of Science—&amp; as this just involved light work he thought I might take it be all the easier.</p>
<p>I declined the appointment at first, but the Home Secretary asked me to call upon him &amp; as I found he was ready &amp; willing to smooth some difficulties which I saw were likely to arise—I accepted the appointment &amp; left the adjustments in his hands</p>
                    <p>Lord Spencer behaved like a trump &amp; I understand the Treasury also consented— But there has evidently been some hitch. However I have reason to believe it is all right now— The difference to me will be this—that whereas for the last twenty years I have been obliged to make as much again as my official income in order to live decently &amp; do justice to my children—the new appointment £700 a year) will about do that business &amp; relieve me from the necessity of bread-making</p>
<p>So long as I had health I was quite content with the old arrangement and I am wonderfully well &amp; vigorous now</p>
<p>But I shall be 56 next May &amp; in common prudence I thought it right to seize upon the opportunity of taking in some sail &amp; making things snug for that old age which is likely enough to set in rapidly some of these days, in a man who has worked at as high pressure as I have</p>
<p>The pleasantest thing about it is that the affair is no seeking of mine— I have been a quarter of a century more or less in contact with the governing class &amp; it is the first time that it occurred to any one of them to put me into a better position than a third class Treasury clerk</p>
<p>So three cheers for Harcourt of whom I know very little &amp; who I believe has acted wholly out of regard for Science</p>
<p>Ever | Yours very truly | T H Huxley</p>
                    <p>I am very glad to hear what you say about Wallace’s pension<ref target="#foot.f3"/>   It is all in the same direction 〈    〉</p>
