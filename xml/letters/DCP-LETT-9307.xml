<p>I have been away from home or should have written sooner in reply to your last note.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Cook went to the Islands 1779.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The habits and institutions of the people will be gathered from my brief survey in ‘Mission Life’, which I herewith send by Book Post.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> They were athletic, skilled in throwing the spear &amp; javelin, wonderful swimmers &amp; divers. This last characteristic they have now. But the race of chiefs—men of immense size &amp; strength—has died out <hi rend="underline">completely</hi>. There are none left.</p>
<p>Under the reign of civilization,—deterioration, diminution to a mere fragment, <hi rend="underline">that</hi>, not as you know, a healthy one—have gone on till now.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, <hi rend="underline">this</hi> began after the discovery of the Islands, at least, the deterioration; while the diminution due before only to the limited area perhaps, and incestuous connexions, and continued war, has gone on with <hi rend="underline">greater</hi> rapidity.</p>
<p>The men formerly wore only a <hi rend="underline">malo</hi> (a belt covering the loins &amp;c for decency); the women a loose skirt of <hi rend="underline">Kapa</hi> (a cloth made of bark, in fact a sort of paper). Their food was saltfish, a small species of fish eaten raw, &amp; the <hi rend="underline">Kalo</hi> of which I spoke in my last.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Now I cannot say as regards <hi rend="underline">food</hi> this has ever altered to any great extent. The bulk of the people still live on this food.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Those who are better off will eat beef &amp; mutton now, which are there very cheap. Before the arrival there of Vancouver in 1794<ref target="#foot.f6"/> they had as their <hi rend="underline">only</hi> quadrupeds the pig &amp; the dog. At great feasts these were served up as delicacies—. But Vancouver introduced sheep, cattle, horses &amp; these have been multiplied (the breeds of the former being improved from time to time by new importations) to an enormous extent. A horse can be bought to ride on for a few dollars. Every Native man &amp; woman will have a horse &amp; ride; this certainly was an acquired habit. The women riding astride, even in pregnancy greatly suffer as regards fertility. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. however say on the whole as regards <hi rend="underline">food</hi> there has <hi rend="underline">not</hi> been change enough to account for sterility on your principle, with one exception: the very general use of <hi rend="underline">European liquors</hi>, notwithstanding a severe liquor law passed under the influence of the New England Missionaries.</p>
<p>But when we come to <hi rend="underline">clothing</hi>, that I think has been a serious element. The women are fond of dress as much as European women: besides under clothing they ordinarily wear a loose gown of printed calico (not <hi rend="underline">generally</hi> gathered in at the waist). But on Sundays &amp; on special occasions they dress themselves <hi rend="underline">à</hi> <hi rend="underline">outrance</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> in silks, smart hats &amp;c. in the European style. The men working on their <hi rend="underline">Kalo</hi> patches will be naked saving the <hi rend="underline">malo</hi>. But on Sundays &amp; in town they go about wearing over a shirt of calico a suit of black or other warm cloth (woollen), stockings, boots &amp;c. with a “chimney pot” hat. Now in this attire both men &amp; women are uncomfortable. As soon as they get home they throw them off perhaps, when in a great heat &amp; often catch cold in this primeval state almost of nudity, &amp; all the medical men have told me how disastrous this is to health though it has never I believe been viewed in relation to fertility.</p>
<p>Before 1819, there were for 30 or 40 years frequent visits of American whalers, &amp; familiarity with the customs &amp; ideas on the clothing, food &amp; habits of life of the white man resulted. Love of imitation of the white man is a great trait in these people</p>
<p>But undoubtedly with the acceptance of Xty in a few years after that date by the King,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> (though for long, even now, I fear much of their Xty is only skin-deep) came a very complete change. The early Missionaries tabooed their athletic amusements, prescribed European dress, as I have described, their dances were forbidden—&amp;c. Many of these amusements were associated with Heathenism &amp; it was perhaps unavoidable.</p>
<p>But a puritanical system of X<hi rend="superscript">ty</hi> was an unfortunate one to introduce changing their habits of life so completely. The fact account for it how you will does remain, that our religion has <hi rend="underline">not</hi> saved the race, now so <hi rend="underline">fast</hi> dying out.—nor caused more children to be born. As I have said few, indeed, are born now; children are becoming rarer phenomena all over; &amp; of those born so many die of neglect &amp; want of proper treatment.</p>
<p>The only form of infanticide I have ever known of there, is abortion, which is too common now, which of course must be indiscriminate.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> On the whole I should say the present diminution of the race (in 50 years probably it will be extinct, longevity is rare.) is so to say “a function of many variables”. Some I pointed out in my last. But I have no doubt a preponderating one has been change of habits; that change might have been less mischievous with a more judicious &amp; less sweeping mode of dealing with those habits on the part of the first Evangelizers of the Islands. This I have publicly stated more than once &amp; brought upon my head for it a proportionate amount of ill will &amp; hard words. Take for example the entire abolition of chiefdom feudal ideas &amp;cc &amp; the substitution of a constitution based on Universal suffrage &amp; the ballot box! Their last three Kings have died respectively at 30, 43 and 37 years of age!<ref target="#foot.f10"/> <hi rend="underline">Ex uno disce omnes</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
