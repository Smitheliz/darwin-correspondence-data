<p>I did try the water of unopened pitchers on flies, but they grew fungus immediately; so that the conclusion, though negative, is against the presence of the ferment in quantity enough to prevent growth.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> This it most certainly does prevent when in the pitcher, for I have removed &amp; examined insects in all stages of digestion from pitchers, but have found neither bacteria nor fungus   Bacteria flourish, however within the closed leaf of the Dionoea<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>This perfectly harmonises with my finding only a trace of the substance separated by my process from fluid taken from unopened pitchers</p>
<p>I shall add this when I see proof.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>One other matter of great interest. Two of my plants which I have been feeding have put out plantlets(?) from the middle of the discs of leaves.</p>
<p>This is parthenogenesis as seen in ferns which are overfed! This is singularly corroborative of my theory of dermoid tumours of the ovary which I brought under your notice<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>This is a matter I should like to work up, for though hypo-erchitic efforts (arrest of developement) have been exhaustively discussed, hyper-erchitism (transcendent developement) has been wholly overlooked.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I send you a slide with one of these leaves   Can you give me any hints about it? I beg however that you will not put yourself to inconvenience to do so.</p>
<p>I trouble you with the slide as I am sure it will interest you. May I ask you to return it as it is the best I have. I shall mount another for you if you care to have it</p>
<p>Yours, Lawson Tait</p>
<p>P.S | You will see that one of the leaves of the plantlet has caught a spider.</p>
<p>I also enclose the only specimen of Droserin from Drosera binata which I have</p>
<p>In the watch glass is some Droserin separated yesterday from the active secretions of Nepenthe pitchers.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Naked eye appearances are almost conclusive that they are the same &amp; their actions are, so far as I can see, identical</p>
<p>If you care to try anything with the contents of the watch glass I shall be glad that you should use it</p>
<p>I should like the little bottle &amp; its contents back.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully | Lawson Tait</p>
<p>Or if you care to do so send the watch glass to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I have just read proof for the Spectator I hope you will like it.</p>
