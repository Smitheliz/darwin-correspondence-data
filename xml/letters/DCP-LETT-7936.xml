<p>I have gone carefully through the chapters on man in your Descent, for the second time.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> As regards my speciality there is only one statement that is incorrect. The negroes have whiskers, though scanty ones:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> the remark about the music of savages should be modified—if the negroes are to be regarded as savages.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But that would require a long discussion which I will not trouble you with now. I must confess that I do not believe in sexual selection forming the negro type. I prefer your first idea—that which had also occurred to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wells—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> That is a question I shall discuss at length in my Narrative which I suppose will come out about this time next year—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> My sketch of the history of Africa in connection with Universal History will I hope be out before Christmas; &amp; in one chapter I make an attempt to restore the early history of man: I write what <hi rend="underline">may</hi> have happened, precisely as if it had happened, &amp; I think that I shall account for the origin of language which is the chief puzzle about the origin of man in this way.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I suppose a certain gregarious species of the quadrumana placed under conditions so peculiarly favourable to life that it multiplies exceedingly— The checks on the population of the gorilla &amp; chimpanzee are chiefly (I think) scarcity of food. But whatever they may be this species does not suffer from them. Then owing to geological changes—perhaps the island which they inhabit being converted into a continental area?—they are exposed to a furious struggle for existence against intruding species. Being by nature the most defenceless of all animals they are only able to preserve themselves from extinction by means of their intelligence &amp; their power of cooperation. These are their only weapons &amp; they become developed in course of time in an extraordinary manner. It becomes essential for the preservation of their lives that they should be able to combine promptly &amp; systematically; this can only be done by their being able to understand one another &amp; so under extreme &amp; long continued pressure the language of sounds &amp; signs which all gregarious quadrumana possess becomes developed in an unprecedented manner.</p>
<p>When once the language is formed everything else is easily explained— But is this I will not say a good explanation: is it altogether ridiculous &amp; irrational? Is it actually impossible; in contradiction to the laws of nature?</p>
<p>I feel convinced that the exceptional development of the brain in our species is owing to its being naturally deficient in bodily activity &amp; strength; &amp; there is if I remember right a passage in your first volume which suggests that the same belief exists in your own mind.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> But where I may say something absurd if I do not take care is when I begin talking about geology—and I venture to ask you for your opinion on the hypothesis above. I need not say that the above ideas whether good or bad would never have come into my head had it not been for the Origin of Species. When I read that work for the first time, I made a note, to collect materials for a book to be called the Origin of Mind. Being now older, I see the task is beyond my powers: but I hope to contribute one or two facts towards it derived from savage experiences. But I am merely picking up crumbs from your table.</p>
<p>I make no apology for asking your advice because if I say anything ridiculous <hi rend="underline">you</hi> will suffer for it. My views will be called Darwinian; &amp; the master is usually held responsible though of course unjustly for the opinions of his disciples—</p>
<p>I remain | Yours very truly | Winwood Reade</p>
