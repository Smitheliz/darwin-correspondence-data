<p>I can hardly expect to add anything to your knowledge of ants; but as I lately observed some behaviour on their part which not only seems to me somewhat peculiar and noteworthy but different in some respects from anything I find in books that treat of their nature and habits, I venture to send you an account of it at the risk of asking you to read what may prove to be neither new nor very interesting.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>The exhibition of emotion in the conduct of ants, their affections, sympathy for each other in distress etc., I find described by several writers; and among other instances is one, generally quoted, wherein after a disaster that had caused the death of many ants, the survivors came and bore off the dead; but I have found no case like this where the presence of dead or dying ants caused the others to flee in terror from the spot, or where the killing of a single ant on their accustomed path (no visible trace being left) caused all approaching ants to stop, turn about, run home and stay there, abandoning their errand altogether.</p>
<p>Thinking that this instance may differ a little from any yet recorded I have written it out at some length in the accompanying paper in the hope that it may be worth your reading</p>
<p>Your last work<ref target="#foot.f2"/> finds many readers here. A bookseller told me lately that there was not a copy to be had in town although the dealers had received large supplies. I beg leave to offer you my congratulations on your continued good health—judging it, at least, by your ability to labour.</p>
<p>Let me ask you also to present my regards to your sons. I hope they retain pleasant recollections of their visit here.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> | With sincere respect and regard | I am Very Truly Yours | James D. Hague <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
