<p>I am so sorry to hear of all your suffering: it is most grievous that you should so soon fall back after Malvern, &amp; how patiently you seem to bear it.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I suppose the pain is extremely severe: very oddly I had yesterday morning just a touch of it; my back feeling locked &amp; rigid! I never felt such a thing before.—</p>
<p>I should very much like to have ever such brief a note before very long to hear how you are getting on.— I had no idea that lumbago ever became so long-continued &amp; severe as in your case.</p>
<p>I fear I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not possibly be able to join you, at Malvern; for I could hardly leave my wife now for the next two or three months.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>You ask Georgy’s age; he is just turned eleven: perhaps a little, &amp; but very little earlier would have been better for his going; as he is thrown back by his entire ignorance of Greek: he is very forward in everything except that &amp; Arithmetick, of which much account is made.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Georgy was at first put under care of Penfold, &amp; as he says that he (or his brother I forget which) is your God Child, he must be son of P. of Christ Coll:.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Many thanks for such answers as you could give to my diverse queries: I have since taken birds with seeds in crops to Eagles &amp; Owls at Zoolog. Soc., &amp; the pellets with all seeds apparently perfect were thrown up in 18 &amp; 16 hours; but the Keepers thought this <hi rend="underline">much</hi> sooner than often happens. We have thus an effective means of distribution of any seed eaten by any Birds, for Hawks &amp; owls are often blown far out to sea: I am trying whether the seeds will germinate.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>If <hi rend="underline">when you are better</hi> you do not dislike writing to your nephew in Jamaica, it would be really an <hi rend="underline">important gain</hi> to me, to know whether the eggs of Lizards, (or snakes) &amp; Shells will float in <hi rend="doubleUnderline">sea-water</hi> say for a week (or 10 days); &amp; if they will float for that time, if he would wash them in pure water &amp; keep them to see whether they would hatch, it would be still greater Service. If many could be obtained it would be well to try whether some would hatch after 5 days floating &amp; some after 10 days. But if they sink, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. care less.—</p>
<p>I have given up in despair trying to get lizards eggs in England.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>But I fear your nephew w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think the experiment too foolish.</p>
<p>My dear old friend, no one can more sincerely wish for your recovery than I do.— With our very kind remembrances to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Fox | Your’s most truly | Ch. Darwin</p>
