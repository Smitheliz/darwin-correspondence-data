        <abstract>
            <p>At the suggestion of J. D. Hooker CD offers his opinion on the value of a proposed collection to be made at the Galápagos. The display would not be attractive or appealing to amateurs in natural history, but the scientific value of good collections of every species would be very great if those of each island are rigorously kept separate.</p>

<p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker has written to me to say that you would like to hear my opinion on the value of a collection made at the Galapagos.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Perhaps you may have read my Journal; &amp; if so, you will have observed that all the productions are singularly unattractive in appearance, &amp; this, no doubt, renders this collection less interesting.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>But under a purely scientific point of view, I think it would be scarcely possible to exaggerate the interest of a good collection of every species rigorously kept separate from each island. It would throw much light on variation (&amp; as I believe on the origin of Species) &amp; on geographical distribution.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> No doubt many curious facts could be observed on the habits of the Birds &amp; Reptiles. Probably there would be curious facts on the naturalisation &amp; spreading of introduced plants &amp; animals.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Some of the islands were only just visited by the Beagle, &amp; these would be well worth exploring.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The climate is perfectly healthy. The dismal scenery is like that of another world. I look back to my 6 weeks on these islands with extraordinary interest. But you must be prepared for mere amateurs in Natural History thinking little of any collection made there.</p>
<p>If you go, it would well deserve your attention to ascertain how the marine Amblyrhynchus breeds.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Pray attend to presence of sea-borne seeds in drift on the beaches exposed to prevailing currents.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>with most cordial wishes for your success if you start, &amp; with sincere respect for your zeal, pray believe me Dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">The <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> collections from the Galápagos islands indicated not only that the majority of the land birds were endemic to the archipelago as a whole, but also that some were endemic to specific islands. The results of the analyses of avian, mammalian, and botanical collections from the archipelago between 1837 and 1859 led CD to accord great importance to the role of geographical isolation in the production of new species (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi></ref>, pp. 254–6, 273–4; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 107–8; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7547.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sulloway 1979</ref> and 1984).</note>

CD believed insights would be gained into the processes of adaptation, variation, and natural selection as a result of examining the nature of plants or animals that had successfully replaced the endemic flora and fauna of any country. In particular, CD noted that naturalised plants exhibited a ‘highly diversified nature’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 114–16).
