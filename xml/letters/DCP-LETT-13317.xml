<p>I hasten to relieve your mind about writing on vivisection, as I am sure that none of the physiologists would desire you to do so if you feel it a bother.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> After all, there are plenty of other men to do the writing, and if some of them quote the marked sentences in your letter (which I return), with the statement that you still adhere to them, the chief thing will be done—viz. showing again and emphatically on which side you are.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>It is not intended to call the article a ‘Symposium.’ I only used this word to show that they are to be of the same composite kind as those which the ‘Nineteenth Century’ previously published under this designation.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Your letter gives me the first news of your brother’s death.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I remember very well seeing him one day when I called on you at his house. It must make you very sad, and I am sorry to have written you at such a time.</p>
<p>I have already sent in a short review of Roux’s book, but should like to see about the bees in ‘Kosmos.’<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am trying some experiments with bees here on way-finding; but, contrary to my expectations, I find that most bees, when marked and liberated at one hundred yards from their hive, do not get back for a long time. This fact makes it more difficult to test their mode of way-finding, as the faculty (whatever it is) does not seem to be certain.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Many thanks for sending me the book on Worms so early.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> As yet I have only had time to look at the table of contents, which seems most interesting.</p>
                    <p>Lockyer is staying here just now, and has given me the proofs of his book. It seems to me that he has quite carried the position as to the elements being products of development.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f9"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2971.xml">Norman Lockyer</ref>, who believed that inorganic evolution proceeded alongside organic evolution, published no books between 1878 and 1887.

It is possible that Lockyer showed Romanes pages of his series of lectures ‘Solar physics: chemistry of the sun’, which had been published in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> in July and August 1881 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11617.xml">Lockyer 1881</ref>).
