                    <p>In conversation the other day with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bennett (Brother of Sir John Bennett) he suggested that you might somewhat appreciate and perhaps utilize my views on one or two subjects.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>First I should tell you that I am largely indebted to you for your theories; and many years ago wrote that all our short woolled or Down Breeds of sheep, can only be kept in perpetuity upon our Chalk formations; our long woolled Breeds upon the Oolitic Series; whilst our Hereford Beasts (with white faces) can only be kept upon one Red Sandstone formation and our Devon Beasts (without white faces) upon the other Red Sand stone formation; and with sheep, particularly, the finest wool, flesh, and bone, is found nearest the sea level; increasing in coarseness with the various zones of altitude.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Even the Pigs also in the South of England, are Black; in the Middle of England pied; and in the North White: each Geological Strata having its flora and fauna in a remarkable degree and it seems to me, not too much to say that there is little difference upon an Analysis of the soils; the vegetable life growing thereon; or the Animals belonging to each strata.—</p>
                    <p>All this I have advised through my Life to my Agricultural friends without making much way, but it occurs to me that something might be done, just at this moment, to enlighten the Public upon the occasion of the approaching meeting of the Royal Agricultural Society at Kilburn; of which Society I am one of the oldest members having been elected in 1839, the year it was founded.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>I am grieved at so much ignorance amongst my Agricultural friends and would gladly aid in their improvement, if a few friends could be found to attack them in their stronghold the Council of the Society: but what would better please me would be to put in practice my theory upon the Estate of some large Landowner which as a Land Agent I have long striven to do but without success.—</p>
<p>The practice of Agriculture upon Scientific principles, has long been my object; and it is sad to know that we have Cattle diseases, Potato diseases &amp;c, all of which are preventible but in the eyes of leading Agriculturist are put down as Chronic.—</p>
                    <p>With much respect | Believe me; Yours faithfully | Frederick King.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">No publication by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2692.xml">King</ref> on sheep and geological formations has been identified. The Hereford breed is the Ryeland (so-called because they were grazed on rye pastures); it is a short-wool breed. Down breeds include Southdown, Hampshire Down, and Wiltshire; the South Devon and Devon Longwool are both longwool breeds. For more on the development of sheep breeds in different parts of Britain at this time, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10682.xml">Wrightson 1898</ref>. Downs are ranges of chalk hills in several southern and eastern counties of England, oolites are found in the Cotswolds, the Isle of Portland and parts of south Wales and the North Yorkshire moors, and red sandstone is mainly in the north east and the central parts of Scotland, western England, and south Wales.</note>
