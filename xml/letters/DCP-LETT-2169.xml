<p>Will the writer of the highly remarkable article on weeds in your last Number have the kindness to state why he supposes that “there is too much reason to believe that foreign seed of an indigenous species is often more prolific than that grown at home?”<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Is it meant that the plant produced from the foreign seed actually produces more seed, or merely that the introduced stock is more vigorous than the native stock? I have no doubt that so acute an observer has some good reason for his belief. The point seems to me of considerable interest in regard to the great battle for life which is perpetually going on all around us. The great American botanist, Dr. Asa Gray, believes that in the United States there are several plants now naturalised in abundance from imported seed, which are likewise indigenous; and my impression is (but writing from home I cannot refer to his letter to me)<ref target="#foot.f3"/> that the imported stock prevails over the aboriginal. So again, Dr. Hooker in his admirable Flora of New Zealand has told us that the common Sonchus has spread extensively from imported seed, whilst the same species is likewise an aboriginal; the natives in this instance being able from trifling differences to distinguish the two stocks.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Might I further ask whether it is now some years since the seed of Sinapis nigra was accidentally introduced on the farm described; and if so, whether the common Charlock still remains in lessened numbers owing to the presence of the invader, and without, as far as known, fresh seed of the invading S. nigra having been introduced?—whether, in short, it was a fair fight between the two species, ending in the victory of the Black Mustard?<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Would it be trespassing too much on the kindness of the writer of the article to ask whether he knows of any other analogous cases of a weed introduced from other land beating out, to a greater or lesser extent, a weed previously common in any particular field or farm?<ref target="#foot.f6"/> <hi rend="underline">C. Darwin, Down, Bromley, Kent.</hi></p>

However these, as being wholly foreigners, seldom make rapid progress, whilst there is too much reason to believe that foreign seed of an indigenous species is often more prolific than that grown at home.</quote></note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">The reference is to one of the cases given in the <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette</hi> (see n. 2, above) illustrative of how seeds of unwanted species could be introduced into a field with manure. The article described how a large quantity of black mustard, <hi rend="italic">Sinapis nigra</hi>, was unwittingly introduced into a crop of flax. In various ways the weed seeds got into the manure heaps, and the black mustard soon became widespread, ‘having nearly expelled the former common Sinapis arvensis—a circumstance which we think partly accounted for by the greater fecundity of the former, when compared with the latter’ (<hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette</hi>, 7 November 1857, p. 762).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD received a letter from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_712.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">James Buckman</ref> in response to the printed version of this letter. Although Buckman’s letter has not been found, a printed response appeared in <hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle and Agricultural Gazette</hi>, 2 January 1858, p. 11, and there is an abstract of it, in CD’s hand, in DAR 46.1: 41–2. The abstract describes Buckman’s view that many agrarian weeds are the product of cultivation and are not found in the wild.</note>
