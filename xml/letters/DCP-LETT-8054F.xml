<p>Thanks for Abbott letter.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I’m sorry to say I don’t much like its tone. I call it flabby &amp; it lowers my opinion of him. His sending the 50 dollars too shows a great want of judgement.— However this is beside the point— what I meant to beg you to consider very seriously is whether it isn’t a great pity that you should lend your name to <hi rend="underline">any religious movement</hi> whatever. If you write any sentence to be printed it will mean so m. more than that you have read through the Truths for the Times once or twice &amp; were much struck with them.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I consider that is in your private capacity just as Jones or Smith might be struck—but printing it as the Author of the Origin it <hi rend="underline">ought</hi> to &amp; <hi rend="underline">will</hi> mean very much more than I think it has a right to mean— I don’t want you to commit yourself to any definite opinions in the religious scientific questions. You have not time or strength to go in for it thoroughly. &amp; then speaking of it damages you as a scientific man &amp; does not do a compensating good to free thought— I feel so profound a conviction that to let people draw their own inferences if they feel that you have no party spirit will be such an infinitely stronger lever. I have felt so thankful you were not as Tyndall—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> You ought to be as careful of your fair fame as Cæsars wife or whomever it was.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I feel very stupid this morning &amp; can only just scrattle down my thoughts which have been coming to a head since I read Abbotts letter &amp; wh. have been ripened by talking it over with R.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> R. &amp; I are both rather unhappy that yr name is down for Voysey— You don’t care 2<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula><hi rend="superscript">d</hi> abt Voysey’s new Church— you only think he has fought a good fight (wherein I don’t agree for I think he fought an unworthy fight) but I don’t like you to be ticketted as a Voyseyite—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I think it damaging to you.</p>
<p>Forgive this cool lecture dear Father I’m too stupid to make it not read so bald &amp; dictatorial— I only mean it is my deliberate opinion— | Ever your faithful | Rhadamantha<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Send word how much time you can allow for reading M.S. | R. &amp; I will be delighted to read over Music M.S carefully.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
