<p>I want to beg a favour of you &amp; sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very much obliged if you could kindly grant it.— I am keeping all Breeds of Pigeons on account of the subject of Variation, on which I know that you are much interested.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have just ordered a pair of Smiters from a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Roe of Salisbury,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> who informs me that he got this very rare Breed from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. <hi rend="doubleUnderline">K</hi> inder or <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Tr</hi> inder Jun<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> of Cirencester. Now would you be so very kind as to endeavour to find out the gentleman &amp; beg him to answer the questions on the enclosed paper. You would thus confer a great favour on me.</p>
<p>Supposing that for any reason you do not like to do this; will you let me know, &amp; I will ask my cousin M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Holland of Dumpleton to make the enquiries,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but as he is not on the spot, I have ventured to ask you.—</p>
<p>I have lately seen a short abstract in Athenæum of a communication by you on the variation of Plants by culture read before Brit. Assoc.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I feel the deepest &amp; most lively interest in these researches of yours— Will you tell me whether they will be published <hi rend="underline">in detail</hi> &amp; soon? For I must get the volume whenever published.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bentham<ref target="#foot.f6"/> told me sometime ago that you had already published on this subject;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> will you be so kind, as to give me references of any papers by you on this subject, as I must carefully study all that you have done on this head.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I hope that you will forgive my troubling you, &amp; believe me | My dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>

<p>(1)Whence were the Smiters procured: if from abroad what name did they bear? <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/>(2)What are the peculiarities in their habits? <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/>(3)Will they display their peculiarities in a cage, some 5 or 6 yards long by 4 or 5 broad &amp; ten ft high? Or must they be quite free.— <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/>(4).Are the peculiarities the same in <hi rend="underline">Cock</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Hen</hi>? are they equally displayed in all; or are some Birds much better than others? I refer of course, only to pure bred Birds.— <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/>(5)Do they breed true in form &amp; colour?</p>
