     <p>I have to thank you for your note &amp; Lyell’s letter.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Janson shall be properly attended to—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have been very glad to see Lyell’s letter: it is a capital one, &amp; how well he seems to have read your Book.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I agree with <hi rend="underline">almost</hi> everything which he says there as far as I have gone, which is not half through yet.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> With respect to your Book, I may say that all which I have read has been <hi rend="underline">most</hi> interesting (notwithstanding that I remembered well the passages quoted from I.M.<ref target="#foot.f6"/>) &amp; several of your facts &amp; views have already given me quite devilish puzzles, which you ought to take as a compliment. What Lyell says about links being destroyed, I think, is very true.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I did snigger at your “legitimate variation” &amp; I see I dashed the word with a (!).<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I have heard Unitarianism called a feather-bed to catch a falling Christian;<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; I think you are now on just such a feather bed, but I believe you will fall much lower &amp; lower.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Do you not feel that “your little exceptions” are getting pretty numerous?<ref target="#foot.f11"/> It is a funny argument of yours that I (&amp; other horrid wretches like me) may be right, because we are in a very poor minority. anyhow it is a comfort to believe that <hi rend="underline">some others</hi> will soon be with me.</p>
<p>Adios | Your’s very sincerely | C. Darwin<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Dated by CD’s notes about a letter from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref> to Wollaston (see n. 2, below).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">The letter from Lyell to Wollaston concerned Lyell’s view of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8453.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1856</ref>. CD’s notes on this letter survive in DAR 205.1: 61, 62. The notes are headed: ‘Lyell letter to Wollaston. June 1856’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Perhaps a reference to CD’s intention to read Edward Westley Janson’s paper on the occurrence of rare Coleoptera in Britain (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4155.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Janson 1848</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD’s annotated copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8453.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1856</ref>, presented to him by the author, is in the Darwin Library–CUL. The work was dedicated to CD, ‘Whose researches, in various parts of the world, have added so much to our knowledge of Zoological geography’. CD entered it into his reading notebook on 5 June 1856 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Appendix IV, 128: 18).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Among his comments on points raised by Lyell in Lyell’s letter to Wollaston, CD made the following note (DAR 205.1: 61v.): <quote> Lyell says that in [<hi rend="italic">interl</hi>] the transmutationists the weakest point is the appearance of fresh organs.— *true, but what an example [<hi rend="italic">added pencil</hi>] (Oh how weak for he instances tail, that man might get tail by wishing, because he has rudiment—but how first get the vertebræ—oh oh—look at <hi rend="italic">[</hi>increase<hi rend="italic">]</hi> in vertebræ—if he mean how ever get vertebræ, I have nothing to do with it</quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">A reference to Wollaston’s <hi rend="italic">Insecta Maderensia</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8452.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1854</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Probably a reference to something said by Lyell in his letter to Wollaston (see n. 2, above). Wollaston had cited Lyell’s views on the effects of exterminating species in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8453.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1856</ref>, p. 179.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">The passage occurs in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8453.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1856</ref>, p. 35, where Wollaston discussed his belief in the ultimate fixity of species: <quote> We should remember, also, that the boundaries of insect instability are restricted; and, although we would advocate freedom of development within limits which are more or less comprehensive according to the species, to pass beyond them would be confusion, and such as could result from a <hi rend="italic">lapsus Naturæ</hi> only, rather than from a power of legitimate variation.</quote> CD underlined the last two words and added an exclamation mark in the margin.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Erasmus Darwin had defined Unitarianism in this way (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4842.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">LL</hi></ref> 2: 158).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">CD’s expectation that Wollaston would be converted to transmutation was disappointed. Wollaston’s review of the <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1860</ref>) was one of the more hostile ones.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">Wollaston had stated that ‘where there is a law there must be an exception to it’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8453.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1856</ref>, pp. 72–3).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12">Attached to the original of this letter in the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1454.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edinburgh University</ref> Library is one from Wollaston to Lyell, indicating that Wollaston was forwarding CD’s letter to Lyell.</note>
