<p>I must write a line to thank you for your letter and enlighten you as to what seems an enigma.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The Duke of Argyle lately made a speech at an agricultural meeting wherein he made large reference to your theory of the origin of species by artificial selection, and improved the occasion by shewing how new and valuable varieties of stock had been bred exhorting to further efforts. Hence some of the papers have named him the Darwinian Duke.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I heard somehow, before it got public that one of our Dukes was very ill, somehow I mistook which, and thought it Argyle whereas it is Athol,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> so I made a rare confusion, which I thus interpret.</p>
<p>I hope your trip to Malvern will do you much good.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> You had better have come North and next year should we be here I hope you will be tempted to come in a body. There is a fine hydropathic establishment now being built on a beautiful spot at Forres and with our famous climate the vicinity of the sea and good opportunities for excursions to many interesting places I hope the conviction that it is <hi rend="underline">the</hi> place will come on you.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am afraid I can hardly tempt you and M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin so far towards the North pole now, but I shall be very glad if I can.</p>
<p>I do not shoot much.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> the harvest is not in yet and the birds are small. In this country there is not much lowland shooting before Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. I persecute rabbits as enemies and knock over a bird occasionally now—</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear Smith is ill.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> If he should die I should like to get Down Hall for a parsonage but likely the property may go to some one as unwilling to sell as he is.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>The Scotch people have continued to call themselves the most moral in Europe till they not only seem to believe it but persuade others who don’t know them.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> The proportion of bastards is larger than in any country in Europe, and the morals in this respect tally exactly. They are certainly far from honest, but they are all as full of pious talk as an English Dessenter. What can I say more?</p>
<p>Our kindest regards to all yours | Faithfully yours | J Brodie Innes</p>

In his speech at the dinner, Campbell heralded agriculture as a ‘science’, and celebrated ‘the power of man … over the animal and over the vegetable world in creating almost, as it were, new species for his own benefit and his own use’ (<hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, 5 August 1863, p. 6). He continued: <quote type="quote"> I will not tell you … that that power is an unlimited power; but this I will tell you, that it is a power of which we do not know the limits, because we have never arrived at them and probably never shall.... It is not properly a creative power, and yet it produces results which are very closely allied to creation, and perhaps are difficult to be separated from it. </quote> He proceeded to state that no book that he had ever read contained ‘more fertile principles for the progress of agriculture’ than <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, and he referred favourably to CD’s theory of natural selection, drawing parallels between it and the artificial selection familiar to agriculturalists.
