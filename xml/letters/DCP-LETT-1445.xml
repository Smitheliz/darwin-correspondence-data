                <div type="transcription">
<p>Your kindness some two or three years ago in showing me your manner of dissecting<ref target="#foot.f1"/> induces me to believe, that you would be willing to oblige, me, <hi rend="underline">if it be in your power</hi>, by lending me one of your <hi rend="doubleUnderline">old</hi> pair scissors <hi rend="underline">sharpened by yourself</hi>, &amp; adapted for the <hi rend="underline">finest</hi> dissections, in order that I may shame M<hi rend="superscript">ess</hi>. Weiss &amp; Co<ref target="#foot.f2"/> to endeavour to make me an equally good pair, (but to open with a spring &amp; mounted with one arm long, for I have in vain endeavoured to cut in the wonderful manner I saw you do with one elbow pointed to the sky); for an eminent cutter ought to be able to make as good an article as you: Weiss has made me two pair, but they are <hi rend="underline">very poor</hi> articles.</p>
<p>Very shortly after I spent that extremely interesting morning with you,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> my health quite gave way &amp; for many months I did nothing, since then I have been greatly restored, but have found the excitement of London so injurious, that I have seldom come up;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> had it not been for this, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have ventured to have intruded myself on you again.—</p>
<p>I have at last finished my last page of M.S. on the pedunculated Cirripedia for the Ray Soc: will you tell me,whether you are member,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> for if you are not, I hope you will let me send you a copy, when published as if some <hi rend="underline">small</hi> part of my volume should interest you, &amp; some half dozen other naturalists in Europe of your class, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be amply repaid for my long continued &amp; often interrupted labours.—</p>
<p>Pray understand that if you have not an old pair of scissors, which you can spare for a week or fortnight, on no account whatever think of sending them: in case you can, they would not be too heavy, (well protected) for the Post.—</p>
<p>I hope you will forgive me for asking this favour, &amp; believe me | My dear Sir | Your’s sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I ask in fact for another naturalist, as well as myself, namely John Lubbock,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> the eldest son of Sir John, my neighbour, who has taken a passion for dissecting &amp; whom I have often told of your skill &amp; your scissors,—alas, I fear the skill has more to do with success, than the scissors.—</p>
<p>I hope that your health is good: it was not quite so, when I saw you.—</p>
