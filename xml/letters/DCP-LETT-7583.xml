<p>Returning to Berlin some days ago I found two of Your letters and a whole heap of sheets of the “Descent” and really am much thankfull for all the trouble You have taken on my account.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> We remained in Paris a little longer than we expected as the peace seemed not quite sure and secondly because my brother in law was elected maire of Montmartre and his amiable constituents made all sort of nonsence, not only fortifying themselves on the hill but bringing him six guns to protect their elect against the government.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Having no more time to loose we resolved to return to Berlin and leave the humbugs to themselves, apparently all will be settled peacefully. I send immediately Your queries about the man &amp; camels to Suez from whence the letters go with a camel overland or by boat to Tôr.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>The translation and the press of the Russian edition is progressing but provisionally I cannot print more than the first volume, as our civilised Government has prohibited Your new work. After the first volume of the translation will be printed it will be seized by the Ministry of the Interior and I shall to appeal to a Court of Law against the seizure, I have a strong hope in the success as the Courts of Law give very often decisions against the shamefull arbitrary measure of the Minister. But at all events the result is doubtful and I dare not print the whole work as my losses, in case the Court confirms the prohibition of the Minister, will be to heavy. I case of final prohibition I will have another fight to obtain a respite in such sense thant the whole edition should not be burned (as they always make such auto da fe’s) but stored under my responsability awaiting better times.— I hope at the meeting of our Association of Naturalist in August of this year to start up a protest against this realy shamefull act of the Ministry, still there is hope left that the Court will overrule it.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>My prospect for the spring are not settled yet, I intended going to the South of France to try to solve the question about the freshwater deposits of Fuveau and some of the valleys of the Pyrenees, are they realy freshwater chalk but it seems the returning franc-tireurs are willing to continue a small war on their own account, so I shall have to wait till autumn<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The letters from CD have not been found. Kovalevsky was translating <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> into Russian.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><hi rend="italic">Maire</hi>: mayor (French). Kovalevsky refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5986.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Victor Jaclard</ref>, who was not the mayor, but an adjoint of Montmartre (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4674.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Leighton 1871</ref>, p. 49). Around 13 March 1871 the National Guard seized cannons from around Paris and took them to the Buttes Montmartre. The government sent soldiers to retake the cannon on 18 March, but the soldiers joined forces with the National Guard. This event signalled the beginning of the Paris Commune (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 22 and 43).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD may have asked Kovalevsky for information on camels screaming (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-7543.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to F. du C. Godman, 4 March [1871]</ref> and n. 4). Kovalevsky’s brother, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2749.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alexander Onufrievich Kovalevsky</ref>, was doing research at Tor (now At Tūr) in Sinai (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 18, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-7389.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from V. O. Kovalevsky, 12 December [1870]</ref> and n. 4).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The tsarist board of censors of foreign publications was instructed to prohibit the import of works contrary to the tenets of the Orthodox Church, or works that led to atheism, materialism, or disrespect for scripture (see Reiss 1970, p. 220). <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> was initially banned by the Russian censor, but the decision was overturned by the foreign censorship committee (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6305.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Pigarev 1962</ref>, pp. 163–4). The translation appeared without Kovalevsky’s name on the title page, which indicated only that it was translated under the editorial direction of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_6722.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov</ref> (see [V. O. Kovalevsky] trans. 1871–2). Kovalevsky also refers to the third congress of Russian naturalists and physicians held at Kiev in August 1871. For more on the role of the national congress, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8018.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Vucinich 1965–70</ref>, 2: 79–81.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Kovalevsky may have planned to investigate whether the freshwater sedimentary deposits at Fuveau were in fact from the Cretaceous (chalk) period, and not, as had been thought, from the later, Tertiary, period (see Murchison and Lyell 1829 and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1570.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Coquand 1869</ref>). <hi rend="italic">Franc-tireur</hi>: a member of a corps of light infantry, originating in the wars of the French Revolution, and having an organisation distinct from that of the regular army (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5936.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">OED</hi></ref>).</note>
