<p>The eventuality which I mentioned in my last letter to you has occurred,—M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Jenkins has obtained his appointment at the Agricultural Society, &amp; I must therefore make a push for his vacant post.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I shall be very much obliged if you will furnish me with a Testimonial as to my fitness for the office, &amp; also by your using any influence that you may be able to exert in my favour with the Members of the Council,—of course I mean without taking any great trouble in the matter, for I know both the state of your health &amp; your multifarious occupations too well to ask you to do anything that might prove troublesome— Still the weight which your name carries with it will cause even a very slight expression of opinion on your part to have much effect, &amp; I hope that you will kind enough to throw that weight into my scale if you should have an opportunity of doing so.—</p>
<p>I am about three parts through Fritz Müller, whose book, although easy to read is in many places unconscionably hard to translate.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have never yet got through more than five pages of him in an evening, contrary to my usual experience in translating, which is that the amount got through at a sitting, rapidly increases after the first few pages—</p>
<p>I hope to finish him next week, although I am going to lecture on Darwinism with especial reference to your last book on Wednesday evening which will rather bother me.—</p>
<p>The election excitement is rather a nuisance too, although I keep out of it as much as I can.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Hoping to hear that you are well, | I remain | My dear Sir | Your’s always truly | W. S. Dallas <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
