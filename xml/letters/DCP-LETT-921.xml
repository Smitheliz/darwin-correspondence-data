<p>I have to thank you for several printed notices about the Potatoes &amp;c &amp;c—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> What a painfully interesting subject it is; I have just returned home, &amp; have looked over my potatoes &amp; find the crop small, a good many having rotted in the ground, but the rest well.— I am drying sand today in the oven to store with the greatest care in baskets my seed-potatoes.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I think it a very good suggestion of yours, about gentlefolk not buying potatoes, &amp; I will follow it for one. The poor people, wherever I have been, seem to be in great alarm: my labourer here<ref target="#foot.f3"/> has not above a few weeks consumption &amp; those not sound; as he complains to me, it is a dreadful addition to the evil, flour being so dear: sometime ago this same man told me, that when flour rose, his family consumed 15<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> pence more of his 12<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> earnings per week in this one article. This would be nearly as bad, as if for one of us, we had to pay an additional 50 or 100£ for our bread: how soon in that case, would those infamous corn-laws be swept away.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>At Shrewsbury we tryed the potato flour; how very curiously soon the starch separates; it really is quite a pretty experiment.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I have been taking a little tour, primarily to see a farm, which I have purchased in Lincolnshire as an investment (&amp; on which I have told my agent to arrange allotments for every labourer) &amp; then I went &amp; saw York &amp; visited the Dean of Manchester, &amp; had some hours hybrid talk.— I then visited M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Waterton at Walton Hall, &amp; was exceedingly amused with my visit, &amp; with the man; he is the strangest mixture of extreme kindness, harshness &amp; bigotry, that ever I saw.— Finally I visited Chatsworth, with which I was, like a child, transported with delight.— Have you ever seen it? Really the great Hot house, &amp; especially the water part, is more wonderfully like tropical nature, than I could have conceived possible.— Art beats nature altogether there.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have been most sincerely grieved at Hooker’s disappointment at Edinburgh: I cannot but think he will make a great Botanist; it is admirable what a stock of general &amp; accurate knowledge, he appears to have on all such subjects, as geographical range &amp;c &amp;c.—</p>
<p>We are all flourishing here, with the exception of my wearifull stomach.— I hope M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Henslow is better: pray remember me very kindly to her.</p>
<p>Ever my dear Henslow | Yours truly | C. Darwin</p>
