<p>I am very much obliged for the seeds. I had some vague reasons for suspecting that Ammonia vapour hastened and acid vapours retarded the germination of seeds; so after reading your interesting account I resolved to make this trial, which is a wild-goose chase. I have obtained formic acid for the experiment; but as we are going to London for a month, I shall be able to do nothing until our return.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I am glad to hear of your spider observations: if you can state positively that your young spiders had never seen an old spider or one of their own webs, I think every one of their actions ought to be recorded. Your paper would then make a worthy complement to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Spalding’s admirable article in Macmillan’s Mag. for Feb. on blinded chickens.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>With many thanks, my dear Sir, | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">No letter from Moggridge enclosing seeds has been found, but presumably he had supplied CD with seeds recovered from ants’ nests. CD and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref> had discussed the possibility that formic acid might retard the germination of seeds after reading Moggridge’s observations on seeds stored in ants’ nests (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5520.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Moggridge 1873</ref>; see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8185.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 27 January [1873]</ref> and n. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8777.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 20 February 1873</ref> and n. 3, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8779.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 21 February [1873]</ref>).
