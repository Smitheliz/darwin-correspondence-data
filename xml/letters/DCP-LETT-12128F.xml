                    <p>I hope you have had a successful lark at Hackhurst,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I don’t suppose one can prophecy English weather from this but it has now begun to be baking hot; the hot-houses are kept so dark that they say when it is too hot to exist in the laboratory they go &amp; cool in the hot-house. Last night was the most tremendous thunderstorm I ever saw   one continuous growl &amp; flash &amp; such rain that the windows looked as if one was inside a waterfall, my street had a torrent running down it in a few minutes, it only lasted about 10 minutes I think. It was worse than the rain in Norway which G &amp; I saw &amp; of which the American said “They’re not stopping to put it up in drops”.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I must disburthen myself of some axles, &amp; then I will return to my senses. I have asked several people about proshelismus (a proshelite would be a nice word too) &amp; aphelismus &amp; they say they would be all right, but I will ask Goebel (who has been away) he is the “philolog” to the Institut.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>I did some beans extended horizontally in damp earth some causticed above others below &amp; the difference was very striking 2 of those causticed above being more geotropic than the control beans, while the under caustic were only faintly geotropic (tho’ they were somewhat bent).<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have today started gold beaters skin &amp; black grease on Monstera which are growing well &amp; turn from light.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I will see after Porliera, it is very late in growing well but now it looks healthy—I think the pot plants are no use for as I said I dried one till it withered.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Lastly I will try the point touching a hair here<ref target="#foot.f7"/>   I am microscoping nearly every afternoon &amp; could do it quite well. I did the caustic beans to show Sachs &amp; he appeared rather staggered; also I explained to him how the root might grow down a sloping surface &amp; he seemed to have glimmers of sense &amp; said it was quite possible. There was once a ridiculous personal row between D<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Vries &amp; a german named Meyer:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Meyer wanted a post in Amsterdam &amp; D<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Vries wrote a furious attack on him saying he was a perfect duffer in everything. Meyer &amp; everybody else thought D<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Vries wanted the place himself though I hope he didn’t. Any how Meyer wrote a very severe reply which rather squashed D<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Vries &amp; made Sachs furious: Meyer got the place   it said that he lived on the crumbs that fall from his rich masters (Sachs) table; it said that he saw what he was told to see &amp; refuted (or contradicted) what he was told to &amp; so on. I am very sorry D<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Vries is such a wonner for personalities, he pitches into Frank in the same way.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Please tell me Bessy’s address so calculated that I can write to her when I hear from you again. S. Mary seems to have missed her letters which were sent to Villars.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
                    <p>I have got to know a nice Englishman called Purdy at least rather a nice Englishman with a very nice wife &amp; I go in to their lodgings &amp; hear her play sometimes: he was assistant to Frankland &amp; knew Leo when he was working there; he is now working Chemistry here.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I have quite given up bicycling &amp; go &amp; bathe nearly every night with the Finlander.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> What tremendous discoveries of G’s about the cavalier ancestors<ref target="#foot.f13"/>   I am snob enough to like it. Please tell Ubbadubba that I should like very much to see some of Dor’s soldiers &amp; I will promise to send them back.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
