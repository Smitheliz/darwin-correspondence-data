            <p>Thinks J. O. Westwood deserves Royal Society’s Gold Medal. Asks THH’s opinion of his nomination. Lyell deserves Copley Medal, but, since he has Royal Medal, it may be objectionable to propose him.</p>

<p>I have thought &amp; enquired much about Westwood &amp; I really think he amply deserves the Gold Medal. But should you think of some one with higher claim I am quite ready to give up. Indeed I suppose without I get some one to second it, I cannot propose him.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Will you be so kind as to read the enclosed, &amp; return it to me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Should I send it to Bell?<ref target="#foot.f3"/> —that is without you demur &amp; convince me. I had thought of Hancock,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> a higher class of labourer, but, as far as I can weigh, he has not, <hi rend="underline">as yet</hi>, done so much as Westwood.— I may state that I read the whole “Classification”<ref target="#foot.f5"/> before I was on the Council, &amp; even thought on subject of Medal.</p>
<p>I fear my remarks are rather lengthy, but to do him justice I could not well shorten them: pray tell me frankly whether the enclosed is the right sort of thing; for though I was once on Council of Royal I never attended any meetings owing to bad health.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>With respect to the Copley Medal, I have strong feeling, that Lyell has high-claim; but as he has had Royal Medal, I presume that it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be thought objectionable to propose him;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> &amp; as I intend (you not objecting &amp; converting me) to propose W. for the Royal, it would, of course, appear intolerably presumptuous to propose for the Copley also.—</p>
