            <p>On visit to Boston was told by N. S. Shaler how habits of rattlesnake are consistent with natural selection. Informs CD, as rattlesnake is considered by some a difficult case for his theory.</p>

<p>I have just returned from a little tour in the United States. Whilst at Boston—Prof Shaler<ref target="#foot.f1"/> shewed me much kindness and one day when talking after dinner at his home I elicited the fol〈lowing〉 circumstances which, unless they are already well known to you, will I think be of much interest— if known, no harm is done,— to me they were quite new, but that might easily be. 〈    〉 I manifested some 〈curi〉osity as to what the rattle of the 〈    〉 snake <hi rend="underline">really</hi> sounded like— 〈    〉 only by the shaking of the 〈    〉 skins one sees in European museums. He replied—in reality it is such a sound as you might imagine the dried specimen to produce if hung or a tuning fork or if by any other means a musical rythm could be imparted to it— in fact (he added) <hi rend="underline">knowing rattlesnakes as well as I do, I could 〈    〉 now, distinguish their 〈    〉 from the whirr of the g〈  〉 so common in the west.</hi><ref target="#foot.f2"/> I suggested that there was wonderful significance in this fact from a Natural Selection point of view &amp; to this he not only assented but said it had long appeared to him to be the real explanation.— I don’t know how far this observation may be original—but I told Prof. Shaler I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. transmit it to you on my return on the chance of its being of value—, the rattle snake having been regarded by many as a difficulty in the way of the natural selection doctrine.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I met my friend Mr. Pryor<ref target="#foot.f4"/> of <hi rend="underline">Trin. College</hi> at Philadelphia again a little more than a fortnight ago at the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Ave. Hotel at New York.— Your sons were with him <hi rend="underline">&amp; well</hi>;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> but as chance had it, though a good deal with Mr Pryor I never met them personally.</p>
