                        <p>Shall you attend the Council Royal Socy. on Thursday next? I have not been very well of late, &amp; I doubt whether I can attend; &amp; if I can do anything  (pray conceal the scandalous fact) I want to go to Crystal Palace to meet Horners, Lyells &amp; a party.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> So I want to know whether you will speak for me most strongly for Barrande:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> you know better than I do, his admirable labours on development of Trilobite, &amp; his most important work on his lower or Primordial zone. I enclose an old note of Lyells to show what he thinks.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> With respect to Dana,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> whom I also proposed, you know well his merits: I can speak most highly of his Classificatory work on Crustacea &amp; his Geographical Distribution.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> His Volcanic Geology is admirable: &amp; he has done much good work on Coral Reefs.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>If you attend do not answer this; but if you cannot be at council, please inform me, &amp; I suppose, I must, if I can, attend.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>Thank you, for your Abstract of your Lecture at Royal Institution,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> which interested me much, &amp; rather grieved me, for I had hoped things had been in a slight degree, otherwise.</p> 
                    <p>I heard some time ago, that before long I might congratulate you on becoming a married man:<ref target="#foot.f9"/> from my own experience of some fifteen years I am very sure that there is nothing in this wide world, which more deserves congratulation, &amp; most sincerely &amp; heartily do I congratulate you, &amp; wish you many years of as much happiness as this world can afford.</p>
