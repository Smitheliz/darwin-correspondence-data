<p>Two years sinse I read with much interest your origin of species.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The evidences produced were so clear to my mind that when I had finished the reading, I accepted the theory and felt the better for it, &amp; it has been a text book for me sinse. Two months ago I was in the office of my friend Henry T Child MD, of Philadelphia,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> talking about your work Origin of Species, &amp; he says I have another work of Darwins that you will be pleased to read, his voyage in the Beagle.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I borrowed it &amp; have read it with much interest, &amp; I want to say to you that I found many things in both works, that made me wish I was where I could call on you &amp; ask questions; &amp; there is one on page 250 second Vol. of Voyage, in Harpers publication,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> that has caused me to write this communication. It is as follows.</p>
<p>“After dinner we stayed to see a curious half superstitious scene, acted by the Malay women. A large wooden spoon dressed in garments, and which had been carried to the grave of a dead man, they pretend becomes inspired at the full of the moon, and will dance &amp; jump about. After the proper preperations, the spoon, held by two women, became convulsed, and danced in good time to the song of the surrounding children &amp; women. It was a most foolish spectacle; but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Liesk maintained that many of the Malays believed in its spiritual movements.”<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>How I wish you had written out all the minutiæ of this scene, &amp; any others that you may have witnessed amongst this race of men,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> whose common parent with our white race, or the original Adam if there was one who was father to us all, must have been far back &amp; low down in the scale of being, &amp; possibly so low as not to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good &amp; evil. I want to know what this race of men <hi rend="underline">know</hi>, or even what they <hi rend="underline">believe</hi>, of Spirit manifestations</p>
<p>I have been a student of this spirit intercourse for twenty two years, &amp; have allowed no good opportunity of examining its facts to escape me; &amp; have been well situated for observing the facts amongst the Anglo Saxon race.</p>
<p>Will you do me the favor to write to me all the particulars of this seance, relative to its claims to spirit origin, both for &amp; against.</p>
<p>Did the spoon stand erect?</p>
<p>Did not the women make it dance?</p>
<p>How did the women hold the spoon?</p>
<p>Did the women &amp; children form a circle around the spoon?</p>
<p>Were you so situated as to detect any deception?</p>
<p>If you saw any other manifestations amongst these races that gave evidence of spirit power, or presence; &amp; will communicate them to me you will much oblige. | Your Friend. | John Gage</p>
