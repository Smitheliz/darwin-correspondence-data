<p>It seems natural to write you a scrap, though I have <hi rend="underline">not </hi> to thank you for one.—rather Severe, I guess I was very well yesterday &amp; today am looking so well, that my Father owned, he should not have known if I had been a new face, there was anything the matter with me— Doddy is looking very strong &amp; almost ruddy to day, but my Father says his motions are far from right. He paid me a visit this morning in dressing room, whilst I was dressing &amp; was very good &amp; brushed his teeth with an old tooth brush of mine, as grave as a judge— I told him to go in Bed room &amp; see if Mama was there &amp; I suppose the sight of Red bed called up his memory, for he continued for so long crying out plaintively mama &amp; looking inquisitively into my face— To day at breakfast there was much scrattle talk, as annual account was wound up, wh’ amounted to 1380£ 10£ less than last year. Is this not marvellous considering my Fathers personal expences—&amp; presents &amp; everything except his childrens allowances are included in this.—</p>
<p>A thunder storm is preparing to break on your head, &amp; which has already deluged me,—about Bessy not having a cap,—“looks dirty”, “like grocers maid-servant” &amp; my Father with much wrath added “the men will take liberties with her, if she is dressed differently from every other lady’s maid”!!! Both the girls echoed this— I generously took half the blame, &amp; never betrayed that I had beseeched you several times on that score— If they open on you pray do not defend yourself, for they are very hot on subject. My Father has taken Parslows<ref target="#foot.f1"/> long greasy hair into hand, which I am well pleased at, &amp; quizzed him before the other servant, whether he was training to turn into my Lord Judge with a long wig.—</p>
<p>Susan goes to Sea with Marianne on Friday, so you wont see much of her.— My Father seems to like having me here; &amp; he &amp; the girls are very merry all day long.— I have partly talked over the Doctor about my buying a house, without living in the neighbourhood half a dozen years first—</p>
<p>He says your complaint in the ears is <hi rend="doubleUnderline">very</hi> common &amp; <hi rend="underline">very troublesome.</hi></p>
<p>You never saw how the girls doat on Doddy— they say he is the most charming of all the children. I fear he is a coward— a frog jumped near him &amp; danced &amp; screamed with horror at the dangerous monster, &amp; I had a deal of kissing at his open bellowing mouth to comfort him— He threw my stick over Terrace wall, looked at it as it went &amp; cried Tatta with th〈e〉 〈grea〉test sang-froid &amp; walked away— 〈The〉 D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. is going to try new medicine with him.— I suppose Susan in her letter told you horrid fright they had about the mad-dog— Poor old Doddy was safe in bed—but really all had a horridly near escape.—</p>
<p>Ever yours affect | dear Titty, | C. D.—</p>
<p>PS— Please get me out of <hi rend="doubleUnderline">little</hi> draw in upper drawer in chest of drawers in my dressing room my dog-whip. (&amp; leave fish-line) —get it out <hi rend="doubleUnderline">at once,</hi> &amp; then it wont be forgotten.—</p>
