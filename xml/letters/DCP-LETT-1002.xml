<p>I did not hear for more than 4 weeks after your return that you were in England, and now, though I have nothing particular to say—I cannot resist writing to congratulate you on your safe arrival after your bad passage home,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> and to express my most sincere hope that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. FitzRoy and your family are all well— I was in London yesterday—for the first time—since I heard of your return and found your address at the Admiralty &amp; in Dover S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. the servant told me to direct as I have done. I got your pamphlet<ref target="#foot.f2"/> the other day and was very much interested by it, for I had heard comparatively little about New Zealand; I fear you must have undergone much trouble &amp; vexation and been ill repaid except by the consciousness of your own motives, for the sacrifices which I am aware you made in accepting the Governorship.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I hope that your health has not suffered and that you are as strong &amp; vigorous as formerly— I have hardly the assurance to ask you to spare time to write to me, but I should be very glad to hear about yourself M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Fitzroy &amp; the children. My life goes on like Clockwork, and I am fixed on the spot where I shall end it; we have four children, who &amp; my wife are all well. My health, also, has rather improved, but I am a different man in strength and energy to what I was in old days, when I was your “Fly-catcher”, on board the Beagle; I have just finished the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>. &amp; last part of the Geology of the Voyage of the Beagle—viz: on S. America; I will direct a copy (in a weeks time when published) to be sent to the Carlton Club, without you prefer it being sent elsewhere.— It is purely geological &amp; dull enough, but I hope it contains some few new facts &amp; views— I have now with the exception of some Zoological papers on the lower marine animals completed all which I shall ever attempt on the materials collected during the voyage—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am aware how little chance there is of your having time to spare, but if ever when in Town M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. FitzRoy &amp; yourself should feel inclined to spend a few days in the country—it would give my wife &amp; myself real pleasure;—we have a tolerably comfortable house in a very quiet, retired, airy part of the country—</p>
<p>I think I ought to apologise for the length of this letter.— Pray give my kind &amp; respectful regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. FitzRoy &amp; Believe me, dear FitzRoy | Yours truly &amp; obliged | Charles Darwin</p>

He was unable to satisfy either side, and his independent approach to problems displeased the Colonial Office. He was replaced by George Grey in October 1845 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5367.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Mellersh 1968</ref>, pp. 234–5). FitzRoy evidently incurred considerable private expense as governor (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-730.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">letter from B. J.
