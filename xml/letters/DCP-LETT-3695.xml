<p>I thank Lady Lyell (whose kind note to William I answer) &amp; yourself for all your sympathy.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Emma is going on very well, but she has had a sharpish attack.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Lenny has been fearfully ill, but is perhaps as strong as one could expect; he now gets up for some hours every day.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> We long to get to Bournemouth, where though in a separate house, we shall be close to our other children;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; Horace is far from strong.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The last two months misery has been enough to try anyone; but I suppose better times will come.— The Lubbocks have had for nearly a year (<hi rend="underline">&amp; have enjoyed</hi>) a separate house, “Lamas, Chiselhurst.”<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am glad Glen Roy is settled;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> the moraines opposite L. Treig are obviously very important: if the slope inland can be proved, it will indeed be an important fact.— I heartily hope that you will be out in October;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I fancy Huxley will be out sooner;<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Hooker speaks as if the book would be very interesting.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> You say that the Bishop &amp; Owen will be down on you;<ref target="#foot.f11"/> the latter hardly can, for I was assured that Owen in his Lectures this Spring, advanced as a new idea that wingless Birds had lost their wings by disuse.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Also that magpies stole spoons &amp;c from a <hi rend="underline">remnant</hi> of some instinct like that of the Bower-bird, which ornaments its playing passages with pretty feathers.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Indeed I am told that he hinted plainly that all Birds are descended from one. What an unblushing man he must be to lecture thus after abusing me so &amp; never to have openly retracted or alluded to my Book.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Your P.S. touches on, as it seems to me, very difficult points.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I am glad to see in Origin, I only say that naturalists generally consider that low organisms vary more than high;<ref target="#foot.f16"/> &amp; this I think certainly is the general opinion. I put the statement this way to show that I considered it only an opinion probably true. I must own that I do not at all trust even Hooker’s contrary opinion, as I feel pretty sure that he has not tabulated any result.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> I have some materials at home, &amp; think I attempted to make this point out, but cannot remember result.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>Mere variability, though the necessary foundation of all modifications, I believe to be almost always present enough to allow of any amount of selected change; so that it does not seem to me at all incompatible, that a group which at any one period (or during all successive periods) varies less, should in the long course of time have undergone more modification than a group which is generally more variable. Placental mammals e.g. might be at each period less variable than Marsupials, &amp; nevertheless have undergone more differentiation &amp; development than marsupials, owing to some advantage, probably Brain development.—</p>
<p>I am surprised, but do not pretend to form an opinion, at Hooker’s statement that higher species, genera &amp;c are best limited.—<ref target="#foot.f19"/> It seems to me a bold statement.</p>
<p>Looking to the Origin I see that I state that the productions of the land seem to change quicker than those of the sea (Ch X. p. 339 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Edit) &amp; I add there is some reason to believe that organisms considered high in the scale change quicker than those that are low. I remember writing these sentences after much deliberation; but cannot now remember why I did not more fully adopt &amp; quote your axiom of 1832.—<ref target="#foot.f20"/> I remember well feeling much hesitation about putting in even the guarded sentences which I did. My doubts, I remember related to the rate of change of the Radiata in the Secondary formation &amp; of the Foraminifera in the oldest Tertiary beds.</p>
<p>I daresay, however, your axiom may be quite true: I only remember considerable perplexity on subject; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think mammals &amp; molluscs rather too remote from each other for fair comparison.</p>
<p>I am tired with writing this long letter (though it has amused me writing it) &amp; I fear that you will be tired with reading it, &amp; that it will be much too vague to be of any service—</p>
<p>I was very glad to get your note.— I hope to goodness your Book won’t be delayed—</p>
<p>With kindest remembrances to Lady Lyell— Good Night— | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f19">CD refers to Hooker’s statement in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3776.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D. Hooker 1859</ref>, pp. v–vi, that in the vegetable kingdom, as a general rule, <quote type="quote"> the varying species are relatively most numerous in those classes, orders, and genera which are the simplest in structure. Complexity of structure is generally accompanied with a greater tendency to permanence in form: thus Acotyledons, Monocotyledons, and Dicotyledons are an ascending series in complexity and in constancy of form. </quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f20">CD refers to a passage in the third volume of Lyell’s <hi rend="italic">Principles of geology</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4986.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1830–3</ref>, 3: 140), which states that: <quote type="quote"> the longevity of <hi rend="italic">species</hi> in the mammalia is, upon the whole, inferior to that of the testacea … Their more limited duration depends, in all probability, on physiological laws which render warm-blooded quadrupeds less capable, in general, of accommodating themselves to a great variety of circumstances, and consequently, of surviving the vicissitudes to which the earth’s surface is exposed in a great lapse of ages. </quote> See also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4986.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1830–3</ref>, 3: 48. CD had presented evidence in support of this statement, which he described in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4250.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Journal of researches</hi></ref>, p. 97, as ‘the remarkable law so often insisted on by Mr. Lyell’; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 2, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-367.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 30 July 1837</ref> and nn. 1 and 6. The third volume of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4986.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1830–3</ref> was published in 1833; CD wrote ‘1832’ in error. Lyell referred to his earlier statement in C. Lyell 1863a, p. 441: <quote type="quote"> It has since been found that this generalisation can be carried much farther, and that, in fact, the law which governs the changes in organic beings is such, that the lower their place in a graduated scale, or the simpler their structure, the more persistent are they in form and organisation. </quote></note>
