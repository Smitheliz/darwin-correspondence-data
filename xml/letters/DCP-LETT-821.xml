<p>Now for my day’s annals— In the morning I was baddish, &amp; did hardly any work &amp; was as much overcome by my children, as ever Bishop Coplestone<ref target="#foot.f2"/> was with Duck.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But the children have been very good all day, &amp; I have grown a good deal better this afternoon, &amp; had a good romp with <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1225.xml">Baby</ref>—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I see, however, very little of the Blesseds— The day was so thick &amp; wet a fog, that none of them went out, though a thaw &amp; not very cold; I had a long pace in the Kitchen Garden: Lewis<ref target="#foot.f5"/> came up to mend the pipe &amp; paper the W.C. in which apartment there was a considerable crowd for about an hour, when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lewis &amp; his son <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8083.xml">William</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1245.xml">Willy</ref> <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1203.xml">Annie</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1225.xml">Baby</ref> &amp; Bessy<ref target="#foot.f6"/> were there. Baby insisted on going in, I daresay, greatly to the disturbance of Bessy’s delecacy— Lewis from first dinner to second dinner was a first-rate dispensary, as they never left him— They, also, dined in the Kitchen, and I believe have had a particularly pleasant day.—</p>
<p>I was playing with Baby in the window of the drawing-room this morning, &amp; she was blowing a feeble fly (fry) &amp; blew it on its back, when it kicked so hard, that to my great amusement Baby grew red in the face, looked frightened &amp; pushed away from the window.— The children are growing so quite out of all rule in the drawing-room, jumping on everything &amp; butting like young bulls at every chair &amp; sofa, that I am going to have the dining-room fire lighted tomorrow &amp; keep them out of the drawing-room. I declare a months such wear, w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> spoil every thing in the whole drawing-room.—</p>
<p>I read Whately’s Shakspeare<ref target="#foot.f7"/> &amp; very ingenious &amp; interesting it is—and what do you think Mitford’s Greece<ref target="#foot.f8"/> has made me begin, the Iliad by Cowper,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> which we were talking of; &amp; have read 3 books with much more pleasure, than I anticipated.— I have given up acids &amp; gone to puddings again.—</p>
<p>Tuesday morning— I am impatient for your letter this morning to hear how you got on.— I asked Willy how Baby has slept &amp; he answered “she did not cry not one mouthful”. My stomach is baddish again this morning &amp; I almost doubt, whether I will go to London, tomorrow; if I do you won’t hear. Poor Annie has had a baddish knock by Willie’s ball in her eye.—it is swelled a bit, but not otherwise bad.</p>
