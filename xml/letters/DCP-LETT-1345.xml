<p>On my return home after 10 days absence I found your last obliging present of the larvæ,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; your note had been lying here, &amp; I have since been unwell &amp; much engaged, which must plead my excuse for not having sooner answered your note. I have this morning carefully looked with my 18 glass at the larvæ (&amp; beautiful specimens they are) but I cannot see the transverse articulation referred to.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I observe that the carapace is often ruptured at the two corners in the line in question, &amp; hence there would probably be a tendency for a fold to be then formed— I certainly do not believe in an articulation<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I send the more important synonyms as far as I have made them out, but I am not a good person to apply to, for I think the number of synonyms often given in works of Nat. History a downright evil &amp; to be avoided— In cirripedia it is impossible in most cases to know what species are referred to in the short published descriptions— I feel pretty certain of the few given. With respect to Chthamalus, I cannot help you for I have not yet worked out the genus—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I believe the British Species has been named by Italian Naturalists— If you call it the <hi rend="underline">B. punctatus</hi> of Montagu<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; <hi rend="underline">not</hi> the B. balanoides—I should think would suffice.</p>
<p>Smith &amp; Beck of 6 Colman S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> City, assure me that the Asphalte which they sell in 1<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> bottles is better than Gold size for the purpose, I mentioned to you,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have got a bottle but have not yet tried it.  [DIAGRAM HERE]</p>
<p>I see in the probosciformed mouth of the larva, apparently within it small tubular (a) organ; this would be worth your looking after, if you can get a laterally crushed specimen so that the proboscis projects.</p>
<p>With respect to Ellis’ Paper as it is before Binomial system—I have not troubled myself about it, as I follow Rules of Brit Assoc:<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Pray believe me | My dear Sir. | Yours sincerely. | C. Darwin.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Bate had earlier sent CD drawings of the second leg of the larvae of <hi rend="italic">Balanus</hi> <hi rend="italic">balanoides</hi> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1340.xml" resp="#automat">letter to C. S. Bate, 13 June [1851]</ref>). He now provided him with actual specimens, possibly of <hi rend="italic">Chthamalus stellatus</hi>, as described in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854): </ref>104.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD refers to the large segment seen by Henry D. S. Goodsir in a later stage of larval development in <hi rend="italic">Balanus balanoides</hi> and claimed by him to support the first pair of legs (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2912.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Goodsir 1843</ref>, p. 98). CD had advised Bate to compare his own figures with those given by Goodsir, noting points of difference (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Edward Forbes, [1 May – 5 June 1851]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Bate agreed with CD that there was no separate segment for the first pair of legs, stating: ‘That a line across may sometimes be seen in the <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> animals, I am aware; but the fact of its position being not always persistent has induced me to attribute the appearance to an accidental fold in the tunic of the animal, originating in the roughness of manipulation in mounting the specimens.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_428.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bate 1851</ref>, p. 328). See also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854): </ref>104, where, in his description of the first-stage larva, CD stated: ‘the body exhibits no distinct articulations; those given by Goodsir being certainly erroneous.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD did not begin his systematic work on the sessile Cirripedia, including <hi rend="italic">Chthamalus</hi>, until 1852 (‘Journal’; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 5, Appendix I).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Bate followed CD’s advice: <hi rend="italic">Chthamalus depressus</hi> (?) was identified as the <hi rend="italic">Balanus punctatus</hi> of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3371.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Montagu</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_428.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bate 1851</ref>, p. 325). In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854): </ref>493, CD considered <hi rend="italic">Balanus</hi> <hi rend="italic">punctatus</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">Chthamalus stellatus</hi>. The ‘Italian Naturalists’ were Giuseppi Saverio Poli and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3934.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Camillo Ranzani</ref>. <hi rend="italic">Chthamalus depressus</hi> is a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Microeuraphia depressa</hi>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">In the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1340.xml" resp="#automat">letter to C. S. Bate, 13 June [1851]</ref>, CD described his method of preserving specimens and recommended gold size as a cement for attaching the cover slip to the slide. Smith and Beck were dealers in microscopic equipment from whom CD had obtained both his compound and dissecting microscopes (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, letters to W. B. Carpenter, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1050.xml" resp="#automat">[January? 1847]</ref>, and to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3629.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Owen</ref>, [26 March 1848]).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2323.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ellis 1758</ref> was published in the same year as the first volume (‘Animalia’) of the tenth edition of Linnaeus’s <hi rend="italic">Systema naturæ</hi> in which the binomial system of nomenclature was first used (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4797.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnaeus 1758–9</ref>). The Rules of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (Strickland <hi rend="italic">et al</hi> 1842) stipulated that names of species used before the establishment of the binomial system were without authority. The published rules, however, specified the twelfth edition (1766–8), the last one edited by Linnaeus, as the reference text. CD consulted Hugh Strickland, a member of the committee on nomenclature on which CD had also served, about this point and was assured that the tenth edition was the correct one (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851): </ref>x). The British Association Rules of Nomenclature, however, continued to specify the twelfth edition (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7519.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Strickland 1863</ref>).</note>
