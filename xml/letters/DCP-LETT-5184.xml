<p>When I received yours of July 15,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I had just returned from a week of sailing on our New England coast, I have now had a week of pottering at home, and next week I go into the country for 10 days. When I return I must set down to a new ed. of my Manual of Botany, and other stuff.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I will soon send you a brief note on a complete, symmetrical, regular, but 2–merous Orchid flower,—in Cypripedium.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Brace’s full name is <hi rend="underline">Charles Loring Brace</hi>. Curious that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wells should have first propounded Nat. selection.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> But a man far-seeing in one line is likely to be so in others.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Appleton has, at my request, returned the sheets I had sent him, as he persisted in the idea of making what he called the essential alterations on his old stereotype plates, I thought for any petty pecuniary advantage, even connive at such doings.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I wish your publisher would arrange with some American bookseller to supply the market here at a rate which would make the English edition generally available.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>When your Variation-book is ready, we will see what can be done with that, &amp; perhaps at the same time may then get a satisfactory reprint of Origin<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I shall take your sheets with me for rail-way reading. I have now got <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the sheets.— Intending to amuse hours of travel with them, I had not till this moment read the passage, on <hi rend="underline">Owen</hi> in the <hi rend="underline">Hist. Sketch</hi>. Owen’s proceedings are characteristic. And your note is the <hi rend="underline">prettiest</hi> <hi rend="underline">piece of work of the kind I ever had the pleasure to see</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I never read a more telling page. Owen must be mad enough at being “knocked into a cocked hat”—as we say,— But I see not how he can complain.</p>
<p>I wait with interest the result about <hi rend="underline">Rhamnus</hi>. I enclose fls of R. lanceolatus.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Clarke was of the greatest use to Agassiz and I cannot but think that A. used him very unfairly as soon as he no longer wanted him or found it difficult to pay for his services.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> C. is a capital observer; but a man of a lumbering sort of mind. His book was founded on a small course of lectures,—of which I heard only one, and found then—and in conversation with him too—that he was quite incapable of understanding what Natural Selection meant—as much so as Agassiz himself—only the former would like to understand it, and the latter wilfully would not.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>You should study Wyman’s observations in his own papers. He is always careful to keep his inferences close to his facts, &amp; is as good an experimenter, I judge, as he is an observer. He has a new series of observations to publish. I think, that he has not at all <hi rend="underline">pronounced</hi> in favor of spontaneous generation—but I will <hi rend="underline">bet</hi> on his experiments against Pasteur, any day.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>I am so glad you are so well: pray keep so,</p>
<p>Ever Yours affectionately | Asa Gray</p>
