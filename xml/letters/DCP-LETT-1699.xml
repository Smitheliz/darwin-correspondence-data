<p>I am extremely much obliged to you for your note with your account of your experiments in the salting line.— Your approbation in the Gardener’s Chron. has been a <hi rend="underline">great</hi> satisfaction to me, &amp; has stimulated me to go on trying.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I hope you will state in Gardeners’ Chron. (or to me) whether the seeds which were left for 5 days were quite wet or became partially dry: in the former case it might, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think be counted as part of the immersion.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I had begun to try whether by drying the seeds for a week after immersion, whether they w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. then germinate; but this day I have had a <hi rend="underline">most provoking</hi> accident in a set of seeds, which had soaked for 8 &amp; 10 weeks (&amp; those which had been dryed) having been allowed to get dry in the glasses, owing to one day’s omission of looking at them, &amp; I fear they are assuredly all killed. I may just mention that some of my seeds have germinated after 56 days immersion. By the way, I may mention, that when the seeds are come <hi rend="underline">to nearly their full period of endurance</hi>: their germination becomes much delayed sometimes.</p>
<p>Hooker seems much interested in these experiments; but they seem to have had very little influence, or no influence, in making him think that plants thus get distributed, which I am rather surprised at; &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like sometime very much to hear your opinion on this head.</p>
<p>With very sincere thanks, pray believe me Your’s very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
