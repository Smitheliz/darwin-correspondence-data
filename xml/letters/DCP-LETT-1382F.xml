<p>By the circular received this morning, I see there is a Council of Pal. Soc. on Friday. I hope that you will bring my affairs before it.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> After seeing you the other week I was with Forbes, &amp; mentioned the foreign species to him; &amp; he seemed to think very strongly that there w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be no objection to their introduction: there are eight of them.— You know that before seeing you I had talked with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Morris &amp; Flower &amp; they seemed to think their admission desirable; so I cannot but think that you might introduce the case boldly. I trust to your judgment: if you can I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. greatly prefer introducing openly the species in the text in small type.— Forbes said he did not believe there w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be any objection, <hi rend="underline">if permission was granted specially</hi>.— will you talk with him &amp; act as you think best.— It really w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be a great blemish to my work, if they were not introduced, as I have often to allude to them.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am delighted to hear about the Sponges: Have you had the bottle I sent last Thursday to you to Geolog. Soc: the sponge therein enclosed, strikes me as remarkable.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Since last seeing you, I have heard from Charlesworth that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> J Pearce has recovered his senses, &amp; I have accordingly addressed him directly—but have not yet had any answer, regarding the Pollicipes concinus.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
