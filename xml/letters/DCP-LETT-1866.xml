<p>It was very very good of you to write me so long &amp; very interesting a letter; but I wish you had mentioned whether you see any further into your very odd case of the vertical divisions of the lava-streams.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have kept your list of the land-shells &amp; made the corrections: I had no idea how wonderfully learned you were on the subject.— I shall be very glad to borrow Heer, when you go abroad.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Your cases of possible transportal beat all that I have ever heard of; &amp; if any body had put such cases hypothetically I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have laughed at them.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have known Colymbetes fly on board Beagle 45 miles from land,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> which, by the way, surprised Wollaston much. We had much to me most interesting conversation, when he &amp; the others were here: Wollaston strikes me as quite a first-rate man &amp; very nice &amp; pleasant into the bargain. It is really striking (but almost laughable to me) to notice the change in Hookers &amp; Huxley’s opinions on species during the last few years.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>With respect to your suggestion of a sketch of my view; I hardly know what to think, but will reflect on it; but it goes against my prejudices. To give a fair sketch would be absolutely impossible, for every proposition requires such an array of facts. If I were to do anything it could only refer to the main agency of change, selection,—&amp; perhaps point out a very few of the leading features which countenance such a view, &amp; some few of the main difficulties. But I do not know what to think: I rather hate the idea of writing for priority, yet I certainly sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be vexed if any one were to publish my doctrines before me.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Anyhow I thank you heartily for your sympathy. I shall be in London next week,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> &amp; I will call on you on Thursday morning for one hour precisely so as not to lose much of your time &amp; my own: but will you let me this one time come as early as 9 oclock, for I have much which I must do, &amp; the morning is my strongest time.</p>
<p>Farewell | My dear old Patron | Yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>By the way <hi rend="underline">three</hi> plants have now come up out of the earth <hi rend="doubleUnderline">perfectly</hi> enclosed in the roots of the trees.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> And 29 plants in the table-spoon-full of mud out of little pond:<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Hooker was surprised at this, &amp; struck with it, when I showed him how much mud I had scraped off one Duck’s feet.—</p>
<p>If I did publish a short sketch, where on earth should I publish it?</p>
<p>If I do <hi rend="underline">not</hi> hear I shall understand that I may come from 9–10 on Thursday.—</p>
