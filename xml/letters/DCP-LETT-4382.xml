<p>I have at last finished—and sent off by todays mail—, in so far as I am able my paper on Primulas.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It has proved much too heavy a subject for my pen; and I feel deeply that, after all my endeavours together with the assistance of your excellent suggestions,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I should still be so miserably short of even satisfying myself. I should have sent it up to you sometime ago, but I have always been trying to improve it and so give you less trouble, for I feel quite ashamed to draw so much upon your kindness, knowing well how fully your time is engaged with your own works. Pray excuse me.</p>
<p>When you time to look it over you will find that in re-writing it I have been greatly benefited by your criticisms. On <hi rend="underline">page 52.</hi> you will observe that I have excluded discussion on relations of Primroses &amp; Cowslips.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> A few private remarks are attached. Perhaps you will favour me by writing and appending the absent <hi rend="underline">foot-note.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I mentioned to you in a previous letter that the non-dimorphic Cowslips had lately produced an umbel in which the different flowers presented a curious series of differences in the relative lengths of stamens and pistils.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have added descriptions of these, along with three rude sketches of the more marked.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am sorry that I had not the measurements of the pollen-grains also; but unfortunately I have had no practice in the use of the micrometer; and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Dickson who promised to do them for me was so long in coming that the flowers were nearly all past.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The one <hi rend="underline">figured</hi> with stamens &amp; pistils of an equal length—both shorter than corolla-tube—was the only one of which he would venture to give me the exact measurement. These varied from the <hi rend="superscript">4–6/4000</hi> of an inch but those under <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>5</mn><mn>4000</mn></mfrac></math></formula> seemed badly developed. I am sorry that I had not the exact measurements of all, and more particularly of the <hi rend="underline">long-styled</hi> flower, which plainly—from comparison—approximated to those characteristic of the normal long-styled.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I have also made few crude remarks on the bearings of this variable umbel on the question of the original sexual characteristics of the Primulas.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> It especially, together with the summary will I fear prove troublesome to you, as I have not at all wrought it out as I ought to do.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Nor indeed can I.</p>
<p>From an apparent scarcity of papers for the last Bot. Meet. here, I was asked to contribute something. I gave them a paper on the occurrence of the Monoicous spikes of Maize; concluding it with a few remarks on their theoretical bearings.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I enclose the brief notice of it from the Courant.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I will be glad to hear, whether I did rightly in openly expressing my convictions on these teachings. Prof. Balfour stated that he did not agree with me in my deductions.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>I sincerely trust that your health—long ere this—is sufficiently strong to permit of your resuming study.</p>
<p>I remain | Sir | Yours most respectfully | J. Scott.</p>

<p>I have entirely withdrawn discussion of relations of Primroses &amp; Cowslips. Thanks to your caution, I had no evidence as to self-fertility of <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Oxlips</hi>; and after careful enquiry, I cannot hear of any person having raised them from seed.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I was misled with the fertility of some of those less marked forms which one so frequently finds connecting Primroses with Oxlips &amp; the latter with Cowslips. On your view, however, we can <hi rend="underline">partly</hi> understand this by regarding them as the offspring of the hybrid of respective parents.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I intended as you will observe to insert a foot-note on page 25. &amp; noticing as you suggested the bearing of the high fertility of certain unions of the Primroses &amp; Cowslips on the frequent production of natural hybrids or Common Oxlips, as affording an analogy with the Verbascums:<ref target="#foot.f17"/> in doing so however, it would be necessary to adduce facts in support of this view—as I doubt not, it will be keenly disputed. As I have no evidence of my own to adduce; I could only use that which you had communicated; not feeling at liberty to do this, I beg to leave it entirely in your hands, and I will be glad indeed if you insert a note as communicated by you.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> The only difficulty that occurs to me is that we frequently find many intermediate forms less or more closely allied to Primroses &amp; Cowslips, without what would be regarded as a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">true</hi> <hi rend="underline">Oxlip.</hi> If these are not then natural variations of their respective species—an opinion to which I can scarcely subscribe, from the general constancy of offspring when either species is growing in distinct localities—we certainly ought to have the Oxlip to explain the occurrence of these.</p>

<p>III. Remarks on the Sexual Change in the Inflorescence of Zea Mays. By Mr John Scott.</p>
<p>After noticing the unisexual characteristics of the inflorescence of the maize, the author, by a series of specimens, illustrated several changes from the normal sexual characteristics of the florets. The male panicles, for example, were shown to produce, along with their own kind of florets, perfect female florets, imperfect and intermediate male and female florets, as well as structurally hermaphrodite florets. Similar changes were also illustrated in the female spikes. A few speculations were offered on the probable cause of these changes, in which the author, in accordance with that principle of reversion to type so much insisted upon by the opponents of Mr Darwin’s hypothesis, considered himself justified in regarding such changes as indicative of the successively graduated modifications of the now unisexual Zea Mays from a hermaphrodite progenitor.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Scott refers to a manuscript of Scott 1864a; CD had offered to communicate the paper to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> for publication in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Linnean Society</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Botany</hi>) (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4185.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 25 and 28 May [1863]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD had first encouraged Scott to publish a paper on the Primulaceae in December 1862 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3844.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 3 December [1862]</ref>). Scott and CD corresponded frequently throughout 1863 on their respective crossing experiments. In September 1863 Scott sent CD a draft of the paper, which CD returned with suggestions for minor alterations, praising it as an ‘excellent memoir’ (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4301.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 21 September [1863]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4332.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 7 November [1863]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4343.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Emma Darwin to John Scott, 19 November [1863]</ref>). There are annotated copies of the published paper (Scott 1864a) in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL and among CD’s unbound journals in the Darwin Library–CUL; see the back page of CD’s unbound journal for CD’s comments on Scott 1864a.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Scott 1864a, pp. 103–4, included CD’s experimental results of crossing primroses (<hi rend="italic">Primula vulgaris</hi>) and cowslips (<hi rend="italic">P. veris</hi>). Scott’s own attempts at crossing primroses and cowslips had failed, but CD had sent him his own results (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4252.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 23 July [1863]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4253.xml" resp="#automat">letter to John Scott 25 [July 1863]</ref>). For Scott’s ‘excluded discussion’, see n. 15, below.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Scott refers to enclosure 1. CD evidently did not write the footnote for Scott 1864a (see n. 17, below); as a result of illness and his conviction that the paper was ready for publication, he urged Scott to allow him to send it to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> as it was (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4383.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Emma Darwin to John Scott, 9 January 1864</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Scott began experimenting with a non-dimorphic cowslip in May 1863 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4174.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 21 May [1863]</ref>). The letter in which Scott mentioned the variable cowslip umbel has not been found; however, see n. 7, below.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Scott discussed and illustrated the variable umbel in Scott 1864a, pp. 108–10. His illustration depicted three forms: a short-styled flower with stamens reaching the top of the corolla-tube, a long-styled flower with stamens reaching above the middle of the corolla-tube, and a flower with the stamen and pistil nearly equal in length, both slightly shorter than the corolla-tube (Scott 1864a, p. 109).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Scott refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1319.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alexander Dickson</ref>, lecturer on botany at Aberdeen University (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2063.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">In the published paper, Scott included comparative descriptions of the pollen-grain sizes for each of the three different cowslip forms he had illustrated (see Scott 1864a, p. 109). CD believed that the precise sizes of pollen-grains were a factor in determining the different forms of a dimorphic plant species (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2048.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Dimorphic condition in <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi>’</ref>, pp. 78–9 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 45–7).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Scott argued that the non-dimorphic flowers in the variable umbel were a reversion to the cowslip’s original sexual condition, during the ‘period in its genealogy when non-dimorphism or perfect hermaphrodism was the genital characteristic of its line’ (Scott 1864a, pp. 109–10).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">When CD reviewed Scott’s first draft of Scott 1864a, he asked him to conjecture in the summary what the ‘typical or parental form i.e. equal long or short-styled’ of <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi> had been (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4332.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 7 November [1863]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4343.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Emma Darwin to John Scott, 19 November [1863]</ref> and n. 4). In the last two paragraphs of the summary, Scott reiterated his argument that the existing non-dimorphic forms represented a reversion to the ‘original non-dimorphic progenitor’ (see n. 10 above, and Scott 1864a, p. 126). CD marked the last two sentences of the summary in his copy of the paper (Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL); when recommending Scott’s letter to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref>, he noted ‘There is good Summary to Paper.—’ (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4611.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 13 September [1864]</ref>). See also n. 3, above. CD later developed this notion of reversion in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4083.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Illegitimate offspring of dimorphic and trimorphic plants’</ref>, pp. 434–5, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, pp. 272–5.

            <note xml:id="foot.f12">Scott read ‘Remarks on the sexual changes in the inflorescence of <hi rend="italic">Zea Mays</hi>’ to the Botanical Society of Edinburgh on 10 December 1863 (Scott 1863b). After describing the transformation of sexual characteristics in maize florets, Scott suggested that the causes of such changes were ‘no longer enigmatical, but clearly the results of definite and well-known laws’, owing to Darwin’s theory of modified descent (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 220).</note>

See n. 16, below.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f16">As part of his effort to determine whether sterility between two related plant forms indicated that they were two different species, CD had long been interested in whether oxlips were the hybrid offspring of primroses and cowslips (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 49–50, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi></ref>, pp. 128–33, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3762.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 14 [October 1862]</ref> and n. 14). Beginning in 1862, he carried out experiments to answer this question (see n. 4, above, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3844.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 3 December [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4253.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 25 [July 1863]</ref>). In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4185.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter to John Scott of 25 and 28 May [1863]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11), he wrote that his experiments were leading him to believe that the common oxlip was a hybrid of the primrose and cowslip (see CD’s experimental notes in DAR 108 and DAR 157a). CD eventually published his conclusions in 1869 in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Specific difference in <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi>’</ref>; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, pp. 63–71.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f17">The published form of the footnote Scott refers to is on p. 97, Scott 1864a. CD may have noted an analogy between cowslips and primroses and <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi> species in his comments written on the manuscript of Scott 1864a (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4332.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 7 November [1863]</ref>). He had briefly compared the two genera, though not particular species of <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi>, in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2048.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Dimorphic condition in <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi>’</ref>, p. 91 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 59), referring to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1774.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Karl Friedrich von Gärtner’s</ref> measurements of fertility and sterility when crossing several distinct species of <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2736.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gärtner 1849</ref>); CD then concluded that ‘the homomorphic unions relatively to the heteromorphic unions in <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi> are more sterile than the crosses between several distinct species relatively to the pure union of those species’. CD had discussed Gärtner’s work (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2735.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gärtner 1844</ref> and 1849) with Scott (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, letters to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4258.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Scott</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3814.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">19 November [1862]</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3853.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">11 December [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4253.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 25 [July 1863]</ref> and n. 4).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f18">CD evidently did not add to the footnote (see n. 5, above). The published footnote on p. 97 of Scott 1864a quoted portions of CD’s discussion of Gärtner’s experiments with differently coloured varieties and species of <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6016.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> 3d ed.</ref>, p. 293, and n. 17, above). Scott concluded: ‘We thus see that the functional relations of varieties of a species <hi rend="smallCaps">MAY</hi> extend to, and similarly correlate the varieties of <hi rend="smallCaps">DISTINCT</hi> species!’ (Scott 1864a, p. 97 n.).
