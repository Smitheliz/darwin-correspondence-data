<p>I was very glad to get your note; but it was really too bad of you not to say one single word about your own health. Do you think I do not care to hear?—</p>
<p>It was a complete oversight that I did not write to tell you that Emma produced under blessed Chloroform our sixth Boy almost two months ago.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I daresay you will think only half-a-dozen Boys a mere joke;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but there is a rotundity in the half-dozen which is tremendously serious to me.— Good Heavens to think of all the sendings to School &amp; the Professions afterwards: it is dreadful.—</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear of your <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> child!<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>We shall be most heartily rejoiced to see you here at any time: we have now R<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> to Beckenham which cuts of 2 miles &amp; gladly will we send you both ways at any time.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>But the other morning I was telling my Boys about some of our ancient entomological expeditions to Whittlesea meer &amp;c;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; how we two used to drink our tea &amp; Coffee together daily. We had not then 20<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> children between us; &amp; I had no stomach.</p>
<p>I do not think I shall have courage for Water Cure again: I am now trying mineral Acids, with, I think, good effect.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am not so well as I was a year or two ago.</p>
<p>I am working very hard at my Book, perhaps too hard. It will be very big &amp; I am become most deeply interested in the way facts fall into groups. I am like Crœsus overwhelmed with my riches in facts. &amp; I mean to make my Book as perfect as ever I can. I shall not go to press at soonest for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Thanks about W. Indies. I have just had a Helix pomatia withstand 14 days well in Salt-water; to my very great surprise.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I work all my friends: Are there any Mormodes at Oulton Hothouses<ref target="#foot.f9"/> or any of those Orchideæ which eject their pollen-masses when irritated: if so will you examine &amp; see what would be effect of Humble-Bee visiting flower: w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. pollen-mass ever adhere to Bee, or w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. it always hit direct the stigmatic surface?—</p>
<p>You ask about Pigeons: I keep at work &amp; skins are now flocking in from all parts of world.—</p>
<p>You ask about Erasmus &amp; my sisters: the latter have been tolerable; but Eras. not so well with more frequent fever fits &amp; a good deal debilitated: Charlotte Langton has been very ill with Asthma &amp; Bronchitis; but I hope is recovering.</p>
<p>Farewell, my dear old Friend. | Yours affect<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Are castrated Deer larger than ordinary Bucks? Do you know?</p>
