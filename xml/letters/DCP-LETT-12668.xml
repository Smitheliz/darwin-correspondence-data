                    <p>I am in some perplexity to know what I ought to do about the enclosed letter from Wrigley.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It would be exceedingly disagreeable to refuse my name. I really know absolutely nothing about the place for the last 10 or 12 years &amp; what I do remember is that the discipline was far from good &amp; that Wrigley was painstaking but far from brilliant as a teacher. He occasionally had good men as under masters more especially for the military boys<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>What on Earth is the meaning of my being a referee. It would hardly be fair to Wrigley to admit my name &amp; then to give a very luke-warm praise of him &amp; how can I refuse.</p>
                    <p>I have just had a letter from Lady Thomson asking me to join them at Cowes at the end of the week. If I can only get a little better (&amp; I do seem better today) I shall certainly go. I feel it is very lazy to do so &amp; that I ought to stop and look after the pendulum, as I’ve not done anything to speak of for so long<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>I found poor Horace quite ill with his toothache yesterday but getting better in consequence of having his face lanced.— We had another thunderstorm &amp; heavy rain again last night. I suppose you are quite alone now.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>Your affectionate son | G. H. Darwin</p>
                    <p>I think Wrigley might be fairly described as good for men not intending to read high mathematics</p> 
                    <p>Pure trypsin (not thrypsin) not procurable.</p>
                    <p>Kühne probably the only man who ever had it &amp; it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. cost about £3 a gramme.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>Will send you tomorrow some stuff which is almost all trypsin out of wh. Lea makes pancreatic ferment.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>

George and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1226.xml">Horace Darwin</ref> were attempting to construct a pendulum to measure the lunar disturbance of gravity; the idea for the investigation had come from Thomson (see <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, 3 November 1881, pp. 20–1, for a description of the construction of the bifilar pendulum; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11305.xml">Longair 2016</ref>, p. 93).</note>
