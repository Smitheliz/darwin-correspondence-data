<p>You will be glad to know that Lubbocks lecture was a complete success, &amp; quite admirable I thought—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I never before recognized any satisfactory evidence of a probably distinct Stone, Iron &amp; Bronze age. Lubbock put it all in the most satisfactory light that the subject admitted of, with excellent skill and judgement.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> (I wish he had written the chapters thereon in Lyell’s book.).<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have pretty nearly got through my Examination week’s work &amp; shall resume Lyell at once—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Many thanks for A Grays letter—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am always glad to see them, he never alludes to politics or “Darwinism” in his letters to me.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> the War has made him very bumptious in many ways I fear.— &amp; I often think that one of the worst effects of a war is the acerbation of feelings that it brings about. It certainly seems wonderfully to have dwarfed Gray’s intellect— how he can so utterly misconceive the respective positions and attitudes of England &amp; America is inconceivable to me, but it is impossible to undeceive him,—to attempt it would madden him.— His account of his “young Rothricks propensities is <hi rend="underline">sickening</hi>,—“w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> make wounds rather than tend them”!<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Rolleston’s letter will please Lyell &amp; I was glad to see it.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> R. is a great favorite amongst the orthodox in Oxford, &amp; is perhaps Owen’s most formidable enemy, <hi rend="underline">socially</hi> certainly he is so</p>
<p>P.S. I have progressed through Lyells Glacial Chapters, &amp; can quite see they are far the best in the book &amp; quite excellent.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> the subject is freely &amp; boldly handled, &amp; bears the stamp of his intellect his Experience &amp; his <hi rend="doubleUnderline">opinion</hi>   he throws himself into the subject—&amp; carries his head erect through it like the Master he is— the wind up about Ramsay is excellent, &amp; struck me as very original &amp; able, but I am not convinced by it. it requires several readings.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I do wish he could have begun or ended his book with the Glacial discussion &amp; worked down to the recent times— The perplexity of post-pliocenes &amp; post-tertiary is very irritating at the beginning for I must tell him how feeble the Cave, Stone, &amp;c. discussion is, <hi rend="underline">comparatively</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; how terribly disappointing the termination of the chapters on origin &amp; on Man.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/>which I have again read over, though still not with sufficient care. One leaves off absolutely hungry &amp; thirsty for his own <hi rend="underline">imprimatur</hi> on the evidence he so glibly adduces &amp; so ably marshals. I think very highly of all the latter part of the book, in every way but this,: &amp; it is the opinion of all I have asked that the want of a summary &amp; authoratative expression of opinion should not have been foregone, &amp; can-not be forgiven— it is an abandonment of Lyells high position,— —he is like a King ducking down behind his throne, when obnoxious nobles crowd &amp; frown. And we who quote him will have this thrown in our teeth ever after— In this Lyell &amp; Stanley are in the same unenviable position, of reticence of their opinions on questions of the gravest import to the progress of Science.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> To me &amp; my papers he has done far more than mere justice—&amp; I feel greatly gratified,<ref target="#foot.f15"/> nay more, <hi rend="underline">touched</hi>, by the evident kindly spirit that I can appreciate throughout.</p>
<p>I have a deal more to say, but no time to say it now. Ever yours affec | J D Hooker</p>
<p>Lyell is I suppose with you<ref target="#foot.f16"/>   if you <hi rend="underline">the least</hi> care to, pray read him the above, I must tell him the same in pretty much the same words. &amp; it is perhaps better that he should hear it in words not written under the vestment of a personal communication—if you do read it, please read this too.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In his paper, Lubbock argued that the lake-villages belonged to three periods, distinguishable on the basis of the materials from which the tools and other artefacts were made, namely, Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age (Lubbock 1862d, p. 29). Although this three-age system had been accepted by many archaeologists in Scandinavia and other parts of Europe since its invention in 1819, most of the British archaeological community criticised it; Lubbock belonged to a small group of younger geological archaeologists who adopted the system. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7949.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Van Riper 1993</ref>, pp. 41–2, 193–7.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Hooker served for many years as a scientific examiner for medical officers in the armed services (L.

Hooker apparently also refers to the extended discussion of prehistoric human remains, including ossiferous caves and stone implements, in chapters 2–11 of <hi rend="italic">Antiquity of man</hi> (C. Lyell 1863a, pp. 8–205).</note>

When the rationalist theological work <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2379.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Essays and reviews</hi></ref> was projected in the late 1850s, Stanley declined to be involved with it, leading one historian to refer to the book as ‘Hamlet without the prince’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2322.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ellis 1980</ref>, pp. 11–12). Moreover, Stanley’s review of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2379.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Essays and reviews</hi></ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7411.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Stanley] 1861</ref>), which was widely expected to be a defence of the beleagured essayists, was ‘painfully ambivalent’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2322.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ellis 1980</ref>, p. 106).
