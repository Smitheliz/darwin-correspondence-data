<p>I received the enclosed wonderful rigmarole a few days ago from M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Noel, &amp; think it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. amuse you to see it.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Tho’ it borders on the silly, yet there is something I like about it. I answered back at almost equal length, in great part in an endeavour to explain away y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. treatment of W.A.D., with which she is obviously hurt.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I said that your information was almost wholly taken from E.D’s correspondence &amp; that W.A.D’s name hardly occurred there, showing that there was but little intercourse between the brothers, &amp; accordingly that you were literally correct in saying “of whom I know nothing”, but I believed you regretted the form &amp; implication thereof &amp; w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. probably modify in a future edit. wh. however w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. probably not be called for. I also said you were anxious not to overburden the book with family details for which sort of statement the public do not care. I hope this will have expressed y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. views fairly well &amp; will have smoothed her down a little. It is strange that she sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have thought it worth while to send the catalogue of pictures sold, which must have been astonishing rubbish.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The copies of the poems have come too &amp; are as far as I can judge rather good.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have promised to send her copies of the M.S. when I go home &amp; have begun by sending her the printed copy of the Waring Inventory.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> This I also sent to Reg<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. D. &amp; received the enclosed letter back<ref target="#foot.f6"/>   I have her two account books which do not possess much interest; they appear however to contain the original memo. as to the receipts for medical practice wh. you have given in the book.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I am rather sorry Leo. did’nt ask young Noel over from Chatham once even tho’ he is a beast.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I seem to have got rather in to the thick of all these cousins &amp; think I must pay a round of visits.</p>
<p>When I was at Glasgow Sir W. introduced me to a man in his Laboratory &amp; said in his impulsive way that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be delighted to show him our lab<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. here, to which I cd’nt but agree.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I only saw the man for a minute &amp; shd’nt have known him again. However he inflicted himself on me today. I gave him luncheon &amp; walked him to the laboratory &amp; after I had gone about a little, left him with the demonstrator. I have been so ill today that I had to explain that I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.’nt go about at all. In fact I have been dosing in an armchair almost all afternoon &amp; am dining in my room.</p>
                    <p>I really did think yesterday I was better as I did some work for a wonder, but it was only a case of “reculer pour mieux sauter” &amp; I caught it worse than ever at night.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Last night in hall I sat next a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gildersleeve Prof. of Greek at the Johns Hopkins University, a pleasant man and (you had better read altho’ to Sara) a Southerner.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I am almost interested in hearing about America from the S. point of view. This man had been badly wounded &amp; he said he suffered much more from deprivation in private life than he did with the army, showing the straits they were put to.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> After dinner I came across a little Frenchman, a friend of Colvin’s,<ref target="#foot.f13"/> who was rather amusing but somehow my French had run out of the heels of my boots. I’ve since heard that he is one of Gambetta’s<ref target="#foot.f14"/> private secretaries.</p>
<p>Remember me to Miss Ashburner if she is with you.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think Sara must enjoy having her here  </p> 
    <p>I hope Southampton is suiting you &amp; mother.</p>
<p>I’ve not heard whether Frank is going to Brittany or not.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>I suppose H. &amp; Ida will be back tomorrow. They will have to decide on the great house question then.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
