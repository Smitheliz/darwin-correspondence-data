<p>I am sorry to learn from your letter of October my answers have not been sufficiently explanatory, pray assure yourself the reasons for such brevity was suggested by your remarks in paragraph 19. and from a fear of inducing conclusions without sufficient data<ref target="#foot.f1"/>   however, I am glad to learn some of the answers have confirmed your views, and I hope the enclosed revised list will prove more successful—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>The unanswered questions have unfortunately evaded my observations. nevertheless I shall continue to note for a future letter.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> “You ask what caused the blushes”, I have occasionally had to construct and enter into Conversation so as to elicit the answers   Therefore you will fully comprehend the difficulty, the poor Jungle Men, and Women, are so afraid of a White Man, that it would be useless to attempt to answer query—N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 3. for some time— While the Malay Women, always have a sarong &amp; bajao dress.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Many things cause the blushes— Doing what they know to be against orders, Caught in helping themselves to petty things—Shame &amp; Fear.</p>
<p>With Chinese, in being detected in stealing petty things, falsehoods, &amp;c, &amp;c. The young Chinese Carpenter I spoke of <hi rend="underline">blushed</hi> because I asked—Why do you not make better work? when his face, arms, breast &amp; legs, blushed<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I have not had an opportunity of attending either a Marriage feast or being in at the death of a deer or a Fishing haul and as the Malays or Chinese seldom allow me to learn their pleasures or dislikes, Nos 6 &amp; 7 will remain unanswered</p>
<p>A Number of Natives answer q. 13. in such a beautiful style I am sure you would be pleased to see. You are correct in assuming laughter is carried to excess. A married woman was excited by my orders and laughted until tears came. I have seen men do the same.</p>
<p>There are no Monkies kept in this part of the Country. the one I purchased with a view to Answer you, did not weep, but moaned when he saw his brothers pass in freedom—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>After again reading your remarks on question 5. I am fully persuaded the expressions are to be found in the Malays, the one that came under my notice was in a Malacca Malay,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> who has been with Europeans, the wrinkles on the forehead continue a very short way &amp; deep.— on the next opportunity I will give more attention.—</p>
<p>Remaining | Yours very truly | Fred. Geach <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
