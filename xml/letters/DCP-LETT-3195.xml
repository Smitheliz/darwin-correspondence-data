<p>I should have written before had I had any definite news to tell you about the Southampton affair.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> There have been delays of all sorts; but I hope &amp; think all is settled. William is gone down today to Southampton with an accountant &amp; as I think we understand each other at last, I fully believe &amp; hope all will be in a few days definitely settled.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. A. demurs about guaranteeing the <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>500 per annum, &amp; has certainly rather changed his mind;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but as my solicitor thought that this was too much to expect beyond the three or four first years, of course I shall give up.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> This is the one point alone not settled. William has become quite anxious for success; &amp; I fully expect will work hard &amp; make a good man of business &amp; <hi rend="underline">do you</hi> <hi rend="underline">credit</hi>.— We shall always feel grateful to you for your great kindness to us in every possible way about this affair.— I think there is every prospect of its turning out a capital affair for William.—</p>
<p>We hope to start next Monday for Torquay.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I wish I had any news to tell you, but I have literally not seen a soul; nor had any interesting letters. I heard indeed from Hooker chiefly about Botanists &amp; Bot. matter.— He gives a very poor account of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> as he saw H. at Club, where 25 dined.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I heard also from Falconer who has brought (for me, but I have refused) a live blind Proteus from caves of Adelsburgh.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> He says he met many interested about Natural Selection &amp; origin of species.— I have been very desultory in my work of late &amp; have been chiefly dissecting orchids &amp; shall draw up my paper whilst at sea-side.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I sincerely hope that you are enjoying yourself; anyhow you have splendid weather.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> If you see Forchammer give him my kind remembrances, &amp; pray present my respects to Steenstrup &amp; say that I have not forgotten his extreme kindness in sending me cirripeds.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Farewell   give my kind remembrances to Busk.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> This is dreadfully dull note. Farewell | My dear Lubbock | Yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I hear very good accounts of your Brother.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Grand doings, I heard, at the wedding.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
