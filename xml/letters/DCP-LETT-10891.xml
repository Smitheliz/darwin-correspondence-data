<p>Your extremely kind letter has given me warm pleasure.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> As one gets old ones thoughts turn back to the past rather than to the future, &amp; I often think of the pleasant &amp; to me valuable hours which I spent with you on the borders of the fens.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You ask about my future work, I doubt whether I shall be able to do much more that is new, &amp; I always keep before my mind the example of poor old Gray of the British Museum who in his old age had a cacoethes for writing.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> But I cannot endure doing nothing so I suppose that I shall go on as long as I can without obviously making a fool of myself.</p>
<p>I have a great mass of matter with respect to variation under nature, but so much has been published since the appearance of the Origin of Species, that I very much doubt whether I retain power of mind &amp; strength to reduce the mass into a digested whole.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have sometimes thought that I would try, but dread the attempt.</p>
<p>The birth-day presents of the albums have pleased me very much, more especially as they contain the photographs of some illustrious men<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am heartily glad that your health keeps good. Again let me thank you cordially for your letter, &amp; I remain | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
