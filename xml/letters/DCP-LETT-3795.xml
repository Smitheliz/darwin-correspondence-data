            <p>Cannot see how J. W. Dawson can accuse JDH of asserting a subsidence of Arctic America. Much of evidence for subsidence during glacial period will prove false as it largely rests on ice action which is more and more viewed as subaerial.</p>
            <p>Dawson is biased against Darwinism.</p>
            <p>Suggests Greenland may have been repopulated after glacial period extinguished flora, by migration in sea-currents.</p> 
<p>Max Müller’s view of origin of language is weakest part of his book [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">3752</hi>].</p>  
<p>Would like to examine the rare <hi rend="italic">Cypripedium hirsutissimum</hi>.</p>

<p>I have read the pages attentively (with even very much more admiration than the first time) &amp; cannot imagine what makes D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D. accuse you of asserting a subsidence, of Arctic America.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> No doubt there was a subsidence in N. America during glacial period &amp; over a large part, but to maintain that the subsidence extended over nearly whole breadth of continent or lasted during whole glacial period, I do not believe he can support.— I suspect much of evidence of subsidence during glacial period there will prove false, as it largely rests on ice action, which is becoming, as you know, to be viewed as more &amp; more subaerial.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> If Dawson has published criticisms, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to see them.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have heard he is rabid against me, &amp; no doubt partly in consequence against anything you write in my favour. (&amp; never was anything published more favourable than the Arctic paper). Lyell had difficulty in preventing Dawson reviewing the Origin on hearsay, without having looked at it.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> No spirit of fairness can be expected from so biassed a judge.—</p>
<p>All I can say is that your few first pages have impressed me far more this reading than the first time. Can Scandinavian portion of Flora be so potent, from having been preserved in the corner, warmed by Gulf stream, &amp; from now alone representing the entire circumpolar flora, during the warmer preglacial period? From the first I have not been able to resist impression (shared by Asa Gray, whose Review on you pleased me much) that during Glacial period there must have been almost entire extinction in Greenland;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> for depth of sea does not favour former southerly extension of land there: I must suspect that plants have largely been introduced by sea-currents, which bring so much wood from n. Europe.— But here we shall split as wide as the poles asunder.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> All the world could not persuade me, if it tried, that yours is not a grand essay; I do not quite understand whether it is this essay that Dawson has been “down on”.— What a curious notion about glacial climate &amp; Basques &amp; Finns! Are the Basques mountaineers, I hope so. I am sorry I have not seen Athenæum, but I now take in the Parthenon.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> By the way I have just read with much interest Max Muller; the last part about first origin of language seems the least satisfactory part.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Pray thank Oliver <hi rend="underline">heartily</hi> for his heap of references on Poisons.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> How the Devil does he find them out? I must not indulge with Cypripedium: Asa Gray has made out pretty clearly that at least in some cases the act of fertilisation is effected by small insects being forced to crawl in &amp; out of flower in a particular direction; &amp; perhaps I am quite wrong that it is ever effected by proboscis.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I retract so far that if you have the rare C. <hi rend="underline">hirsutissimum</hi>, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> very much like to examine a cut <hi rend="underline">single</hi> flower; for I saw one at a Flower Show, &amp; as far as I could see, it seemed widely different from other forms.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Farewell | Ever yours | C. Darwin.</p>
<p>P.S. Answer this if by chance you can.— I remember distinctly having read in some book of Travels, I am nearly sure in Australia, an account of the Natives during Famines, trying &amp; cooking in all sorts of ways, various vegetable productions &amp; sometimes being injured by them.. Can you remember any such account? I want to find it.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I thought it was in Sir. G. Grey, but it is <hi rend="doubleUnderline">not</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Could it have been in Eyre’s Book?<ref target="#foot.f14"/> </p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD refers to the increasing popularity of the idea that many of the surface features of European geology were due to the action of land-ice. During the mid-nineteenth century, most British geologists (including CD), although considering valley glaciers to have been geologically important during the Pleistocene glacial period, had rejected the idea of a Europe-wide ice-sheet; it was believed instead that most of the geological phenomena of Europe were due to the submergence of much of the landmass under the sea, and to the action of icebergs.

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In his paper, Hooker sought to explain the general paucity of the Greenland flora on the hypothesis that ‘the polar region was once occupied by the Scandinavian flora’, and that the cold of the glacial epoch drove the vegetation southwards, causing the temperate flora of southern Greenland to be ‘driven into the sea’. Following ‘the return of the heat’, Hooker argued, Greenland would have been repopulated by the migration of Arctic species surviving in the south of the peninsula (J. D. Hooker 1862a, p. 254). On reading Hooker’s paper, CD concluded that ‘during the coldest part of Glacial period, Greenland must have been quite depopulated’, suggesting that it must then have been repopulated by ‘accidental means of transport by ice &amp; currents’ (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3458.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 25 February [1862]</ref>; see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3465.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 3 March 1862</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3468.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 7 March [1862]</ref>). In his review of Hooker’s essay (A. Gray 1862d, p. 145), <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref> espoused a similar view.

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Since the 1840s, CD and Hooker had debated the merits of invoking former land-bridges or other means of dispersal to account for the present geographical distribution of animals and plants (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref>, especially vols. 3 and 6). Whereas Hooker was favourably disposed to the idea of land-bridges, CD believed there was insufficient geological evidence in most cases, arguing instead for trans-oceanic migration. Between 1855 and 1857, he conducted an extensive series of experiments on the possible means by which organisms could be transported across oceans, but failed to convince Hooker of his position (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vols. 5 and 6).</note>

CD countered the arguments of some botanists that for cultivated plants like cereals to have been ‘noticed and valued as objects of food’, their original state must have closely resembled their present one; he pointed to ‘the many accounts given by travellers of the wretched food collected by savages’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 307), and continued, without giving a reference: ‘I have read an account of the savages of Australia cooking, during a dearth, many vegetables in various ways, in the hopes of rendering them innocuous and more nutritious.’</note>
