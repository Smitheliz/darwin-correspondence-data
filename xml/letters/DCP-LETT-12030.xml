                    <p>I distinctly remember my father saying that Lady Charlemont or Charleville remarked that our grandfather was one of the most agreeable persons she had ever met; and my father added that she had constantly met the most agreeable persons in London. I <hi rend="underline">think</hi> it was the lady who drew Shelton oak. Now do you know whether it was Charlemont or Charleville; if the former she certainly must have lived with the pleasantest people in London.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>Is your memory distinct about R. Darwin (who must have been the father of Erasmus) pulling down the mill because his horse shyed. It seems almost incredible; more especially as tho’ he lived at Elston he was not the owner of the property, tho’ his son ultimately came into possession of it. How he was rich enough to live at Elston and send 3 sons to Cambridge at the same time is a mystery to me which no inquiry has solved.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Will you be so good as to write to Bassett, Southampton.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Yours affectionately | C. Darwin</p>
