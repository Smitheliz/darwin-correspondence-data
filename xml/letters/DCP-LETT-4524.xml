<p>I now beg to acknowledge receipt of your note.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am glad to find by it that you are upon the whole pleased with the two testimonials forwarded. I could not help remarking on absence of any note as to energy in ordinary avocations from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Nab’s testimonial…<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I thank you most sincerely for the admonitions &amp; advice which you have given me on these matters; and I assure you they will not be neglected in my future.</p>
<p>Since I last wrote you<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have heard from those I had been making enquiries as relative to expenses for an outfit &amp; voyage to India.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am sorry, however, that neither can afford me any definite information whatever. In the one case the young men went out in vessels belonging the <hi rend="underline">firm</hi> to which they were engaged. In the other they went the <hi rend="underline">overland</hi> route, but he cannot remember the cost of outfit… The young man who accepted the situation which I was offered at Darjeeling<ref target="#foot.f5"/> was allowed I think somewhere about £20, for outfit; but I do not know anything as to actual cost. He also took overland route… I will be glad if you have heard anything as to expenses. Whatever these may be however I beg to assure you that as you have so kindly and unhesitatingly offered to advance this to me: I will be most careful to cause you no unnecessary outlay: and I trust by the influence you have incited in my behalf soon to gain a position in India by which I may at least have the satisfaction to be able to return the pecuniary part: still evermore indebted to you for the confidence placed in me &amp; the opportunities of ultimately being enabled to follow out the only pursuits of life which afford me an unalloyed pleasure—viz a practical acquaintance with subjects of Natural science.</p>
<p>Should you have heard what an ordinary outfit would cost, I will by your kindly forwarding it to me go in to Edinburgh. I could there get M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Nab or failing him one of the Superintendents of the firm of the Messrs Lawsons &amp; Sons<ref target="#foot.f6"/>—who likewise no of these matters—to go with me to one of the general Indian outfitting warehouses, where I believe I could get as cheaply as anywhere else the necessaries. I will be glad indeed however, if you will suggest the best plans for me: truly sorry that ignorance in these matters should thus cause me to encroach so much upon your time likewise.</p>
<p>I have also to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am glad to find that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker is likewise satisfied with the testimonials.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> The extract which you have enclosed from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hookers letter is indeed most highly gratifying<ref target="#foot.f9"/>   I only wish &amp; shall more &amp; more make it my endeavour to personally merit such. I do feel deeply thankfull to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker for all that he is doing for me.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> It will be indeed a favour if you express to him my thankfulness for this as I am quite at a loss how to do so.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>In reference to P.S. in D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hookers letter I shall be glad indeed to go <hi rend="underline">via</hi> the Cape so as to look after the <hi rend="underline">case</hi> which he then proposes to send.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> In this however, as in other points, I would that you would decide as it is entirely through you that I can entertain any prospects of getting out at all.</p>
<p>You have kindly offered to give me a scientific testimonial.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I need not tell you how much I would prize this. I would indeed like to have such from your pen.</p>
<p>I have the honour to remain | Sir, &amp;c | John Scott</p>
