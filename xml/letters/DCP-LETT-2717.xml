<p>I return you Grays paper which I have twice read, &amp; which I shall read again, as he has promised me a copy.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> He does not grapple with your hypothesis, as Huxley calls it, nor do I see how he could, in the wish he had to oppose Agassiz. I do not see how anyone can grapple with it, for your Book is like the outward aspects of nature, so full, that the Author of nature alone can deal with it. I am a reader, anxious for light, which my mental optics can only accomodate to the degree of their structure, &amp; I can only admire, consider, scratch my head &amp; gape, as the varying impressions crowd upon me enlightening &amp; confusing me. You have not had a more devout reader. I have owed to you untold benefits. I have always said, condemn me to a Robinson Crusoe Islet, &amp; let me have the choice of the Books of the World for my companions, &amp; I would claim for my portmanteau the 4 Gospels (excluding the Epistles) White’s Selbourne—<ref target="#foot.f2"/>your voyage in the Beagle    Shakespeare, Byron, Burns &amp; everything of Milton, &amp; I would be content to work out in solitude my claims for salvation.</p>
<p>I greatly admire your Book, which I have read twice &amp; which I shall read as I do the precepts of Christ &amp; the parable of the prodigal son, till my eyes fail me, &amp; I have to trust to my memory for my devotion to that which quickens my intellectual &amp; moral sense. I owe you (a poor debtor) a thousand obligations. You have enlarged my mind, filled it with power, given an upward direction to my thoughts, &amp; conciliated my respect for humanity. I have for long years sat a humble listener to your teaching—but untill lately you asked nothing of me but admiration for the most perspicuous interpreter of nature. Now you demand of me a faith “in the substance of things not known &amp; the evidence of things not seen”<ref target="#foot.f3"/>—which requires all those dispositions of mind which faith implies. So far, my faith has been individual &amp; personal. I have a profound reverence for Abraham &amp; Moses &amp; Jesus Christ, &amp; I have much of the same reverence for you, whom I look upon as the High priest of nature. But the Church would condemn me to the stake for my religious creed, &amp; you would commiserate my difficulties in adopting all your inferences.</p>
<p>So little reliance have I however on my own discernment, that I read your book with all the spirit of faith &amp; all the consciousness of self-weakness, so that my reverence is constantly at war with my doubts, &amp; I feel as much debased on the one hand as you are exalted on the other. My own side of the balance has a natural tendency to sink &amp; yours to rise. It is the fullest Book I ever read, the most candid—the most ingenious, &amp; the most suggestive. From my humble state I have said again &amp; again, as I have floundered often in difficulties “Quid æternis minorem conciliis animum fatigas?’—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>You have done me one essential service. You have put me at rest about the perplexing variations in Carex—a genus which at times I wish to God I had had nothing to do with for its mazes lead me in wanderings lost.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I can follow your effects of natural selection in it safely, but when you bring millions of years into play, &amp; ask me to believe in a common ancestor to the Sedge-palm, Oak &amp;c you are like the Church, which demands of me a faith I have no elements for. I cannot attain to the belief in the Divinity of Christ, his resurrection—the miracles or the Apostolic succession or the verbal inspiration—&amp; if I am to be d— for it, it is as least a graceful recollection that the rose &amp; violet, which you make my fellow mortals go with me. I do not envy you meeting our common mother Eve hereafter. You will have a rougher reception than æneas had from Dido,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> for tho‘ Decandolle had alluded to the struggle for existence in plants as well as animals,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> You have above all shewn what Eve produced in the fall of our race.</p>
<p>What a mystery is nature, &amp; the destiny of man! To one, like myself, approaching the psalmists age,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> it is natural to look beyond the curtain that falls between the present &amp; the future scene. While I see much in the instinctive religion which nature plants in the mind, I separate myself the more &amp; more from the Church—&amp; knowing nothing beyond my admiration for the beauties &amp; the mysteries of this glorious world, I shall go with a conviction that the power which created &amp; has sustained me will provide for me hereafter—&amp; that is enough for me. Of this world &amp; its marvels, nothing has so much impressed me as the human mind, &amp; no one has more conciliated my homage than your own—</p>
<p>With the deepest respect | Yrs sincerely | F. Boott <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
