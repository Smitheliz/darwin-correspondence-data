<p>Having accompanied as Naturalist, H.M.S Beagle, under the command of Capt. FitzRoy, in her voyage to South America and round the world, I have been enabled during the five years to make extensive collections in the various departments of Natural History.</p>
<p>Several scientific gentlemen having examined them, are of opinion, that it is highly desirable that the results should be published. Finding myself unable to support, the expense of the numerous engravings, which would be necessary, I have ventured to hope for the assistance of Government, so that a work, might be produced which would be creditable to the country, as in the case of Sir J. Franklin, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Richardson and others.</p>
<p>I should hope, this request, would not at least be thought presumptuous, when I state that the entire expense, during the five years, even to the purchase of materials for the preservation of the specimens, together with a salary for an assistant, has been willingly defrayed by myself.</p>
<p>I may add, that the whole collection has already been, or will hereafter be, distributed to the public museums, where they will be of most service.— I have subjoined the opinion of the Presidents of the three Learned Societies, respecting the utility of this publication, if illustrated by engravings. Other naturalists as well as myself, are of opinion, that 150 plates, would be necessary for the new and undescribed species, and that the probable expense of drawing and engraving, would amount to about 1000 £.— If the Government, should, under these circumstances, be willing to assist me, I should be most happy to place my materials at their disposal, and follow any plan they might be pleased to direct.—</p>
<p>I have the honor to remain | Sir | Your faithful &amp; obedient servant | Charles Darwin <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> 36 | Great Marlborough St<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>.—</p>
