<p>Your letter of 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. only came to hand this morning, or it should have been sooner replied to—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a1" type="annotationStart"/>Of course you know Cactus speciosissimus the beautiful shades of colour in the flowers perhaps surpass all others—but the habit of the plant is bad— I take this to be as true a species as any existing— There is another known by the name of stellatus, closely resembling Ackermanni, perhaps the same, the flowers of which are somewhat <hi rend="underline">bricky</hi> in colour, but the habit of the plant is good— I dont know its origin but from the not distant resemblance the flowers bear to the one known as Jenkinsoni which is undoubtedly a hybrid, by speciosus on speciosissimus, having myself raised it in quantities, I suspect it may be a hybrid also.<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/></p>
<p>Many years ago, it struck me that <hi rend="underline">if</hi> a flower resembling speciosissimus could be produced upon a plant of the habit of stellatus, it would be a desirable acquisition &amp; with the view of accomplishing this, I impregnated speciosissimus with stellatus, &amp; stellatus with speciosissimus— I obtained, from each fruit, an abundance of perfectly fertile seeds— It never occurred to me to <hi rend="underline">count</hi> the number, but my recollection serves me so far as to say <hi rend="underline">confidently</hi> that the numbers which vegetated were about equal— they amounted in the whole to 3 to 400 &amp; as soon as they could be well handled, were potted off in small pots 5 round the edge of each &amp; carefully marked— The first plant bloomed in 1850 &amp; produced a flower of much more lively colour than stellatus, &amp; had also a tinge of blue in it. I impregnated this bloom with speciosissimus &amp; obtained therefrom about 50 plants, only one of which has bloomed— it has a <hi rend="underline">strong</hi> shade of blue in it, almost equal to speciosissimus, but the petals are not so even as speciosissimus— The plants that bloomed afterwards were poor in colour except one which was <hi rend="underline">very</hi> promising, but it was stolen from me &amp; though I offered a reward of £2. I could not recover it. In 1855 the last of the lot bloomed &amp; amongst them were eight of very fine colour, the whole of which I impregnated with speciosissimus &amp; the whole of which have come up as ‘thick as mustard’— this is as far as I have gone, but it is sufficient to prove that the hybrids are fertile— I also impregnated speciosissimus with one of the above flowers, &amp; though the seed was to all appearance finer than any of the others fewer plants have come up— I may observe by the way that the difference in appearance of the two first named crosses is so small, that if they were not marked, I could not say which was which but in the second cross I think there are more stems that are angular

—none are so prickly as speciosissimus—</p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>I met with a plant in Guernsey last year but one, having the habit of my second cross &amp; the bloom of a rose colour— I strongly suspect it to be a hybrid, as it came from a person whom I suspect, though entirely unknown to me, has been going on the same tack as myself. This I have also impregnated with speciosissimus &amp; have a most abundant produce.<anchor xml:id="ann.a4" type="annotationEnd"/></p>
<p>I have impregnated speciosissimus with flagelliformis &amp; obtained plants almost identical with those known under the names of Palmerii, Mallinsoni &amp;c all of which had bricky red blossoms.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I also impregnated stellatus with flagelliformis, &amp; obtained forms similar to Palmerii, but not so prickly but the blooms were rose colour— I never tried them any further but I don’t doubt their being fertile. These latter hybrids have all the form of flagelliformis—</p>
<p>There is or was a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lukis &amp; also a D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brock in Guernsey or Jersey who have d〈o〉ne a good deal in this way.</p>
<p>I have done nothing in Gloxinias beyond impregnating the common sorts one with another, &amp; have obtained no results worth recording, but I have obtained a hybrid from Gloxinia tubiflora (quere, is this not nearer Gesneria?) impregnated with Gesneria Cooperi—the hybrid is barren. I sent them a plant to Kew—</p>
<p>I have also got hybrids from Franciscii confortiflora impregnated with latifolia but the plants are sickly &amp; all variegated in the leaves.</p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a5" type="annotationStart"/>I should have pleasure in sending you any of the above if you deemed them worth the Carriage<anchor xml:id="ann.a6" type="annotationEnd"/></p>
