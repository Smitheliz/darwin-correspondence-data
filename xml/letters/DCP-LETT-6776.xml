<p>Here we are, homeward bound, but moored here by the amazing kindness of the people for a longer time than we expected; enjoying ourselves very much indeed.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>We went to S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Petersburgh in two stages, stopping only at Berlin &amp; there for 3 nights; our Hotel was opposite the Pertz’s,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> who were most attentive &amp; hospitable.— I saw also a good deal of Peters,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> who is a capital fellow, &amp; has, as you know, been much in England. At the Museum there was a very badly stuffed specimen of a new &amp; small species of Gorilla from <hi rend="doubleUnderline">East</hi> Africa, &amp; that it was the only novelty I saw. At S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Petersburgh I found many friends, including some cousins of my Mothers, who had married into Russian families, &amp; one of whom, being an ADC to the Emperor, was immensely useful to us; nothing indeed can exceed the kindness of these Scandinavians &amp; Scythians—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>At the Academy I was much interested with old Brandt the Zoological Director who declares that all the Bos’ses <hi rend="underline">longifrons</hi> &amp; Co are one species—that there is but one fossil Elephant, &amp; that the Dinotherium is simpliciter a mammoth!<ref target="#foot.f5"/> he believes in you with a vengeance, &amp; I hope I do not misinterpret his ideas— I saw the <hi rend="underline">Rhinoceros</hi> <hi rend="underline">tichorhinus</hi> with <hi rend="underline">skin</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">hair</hi> on head &amp; feet found in East Russia—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I was not aware, or had forgotten, that this animal had been found with the soft parts preserved.. The Mammoth is certainly a magnificent thing: the skin is preserved in huge masses. But the <hi rend="underline">Syremi Stelleri</hi> <ref target="#foot.f7"/> (I cannot spell the name) of which they have a complete skeleton is even more interesting; the texture of all the bones is like the hardest ivory &amp; the proportion of bone to size of animal I should think exceeds that of any other animal: this &amp; its curious organization rendered it to my eyes the most curious thing I ever saw. The Birds &amp; beasts at the Academy are most admirably stuffed &amp; set up, &amp; the series of varieties of Rodents &amp;c is most instructive in the variability point of view. With the mineralogical Gallery at the School of Mines I was disappointed— Von Baer was not at S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. P., he has gone to live at Dorpat, old Admiral Lutke &amp; Bunge the Botanist were by far the most interesting men I saw—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>With S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. P. I was a good deal disappointed, it is huge, tasteless, &amp; void of all national architecture, except the churches which are Sublime, &amp; the choral services celestial: beside these our emasculated Anglican services, with its halting imagery &amp; puling intonation is contemptible;—if we are to have music &amp; gesticulation &amp; incense &amp; gold &amp; jewels, give them me hot &amp; strong, &amp; the Russo-Greek X is the place for my money. The altar Screens &amp; chapels are literally <hi rend="underline">ablaze</hi> with jewels &amp; every jewel given, is a full &amp; perfect sacrifice for some real stunning crime sin or misdemeanor committed by this most immoral people.</p>
<p>The Palaces are gorgeous, but one gets quite sick of French decoration, &amp; endless cabinets of diamonds &amp; rubies.— The streets are Enormous &amp; horribly paved, distances are tremendous, living very expensive &amp; the place terribly unhealthy.— I never saw such sickly children &amp; I am assured that the mortality exceeds the births by 6000 per annum   immigration of French &amp; Germans keeps up the pop<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>.</p>
<p>The Exposition was very fair, but the arrangements extremely bad.— The Emperor<ref target="#foot.f9"/> was most polite, received a lot of us at his palace of Tsarkoe Selo<ref target="#foot.f10"/> showed us himself over the private apartments that were of Historic interest, gave us two dejeuners, &amp; at the end decorated a dozen or so of the savants &amp; expositors— as I declined a Decoration, he has sent me a pair of beautiful Jasper Vases from a private mine he has in Tomsk, which he reserves for such purposes. I was sorely puzzled what to do about the Decoration, not wishing to be rude on one hand, &amp; on the other, anxious to avoid it, lest my motives in coming, after the refusal of Low to send me, should be misunderstood—so I said that as we could not wear foreign decorations at our Court, I would decline, adding that to English men of science they were not of the same Value as to Foreigners.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> His functionaries were most civil about it— &amp; he consequently sent me the Vases &amp;c to my two compatriots, Murray &amp; Hogg,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> each a malachite table.</p>
<p>With Moscow we were enchanted—&amp; could have spent weeks there with pleasure— it is as eminently national as S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. P. is the contrary.</p>
<p>We left last Tuesday by steamer sailing through the wooded glaciated isles of the Gulf of Finland &amp; Baltic, all the way to this most lovely city—the most enchanting I ever was in. Andersson<ref target="#foot.f13"/> was on the Quay to meet us &amp; has persuaded me to stay till the meeting of the Academy on Wednesday, when we leave for Copenhagen, &amp; shall thence go to Hamburgh &amp; home by steamer next week.</p>
<p>Here I have seen much of the officers of the Spitzbergen Expeditions—most interesting men— they hope next year to go to Nova-Zembla.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Andersson would go again to the Galapagos for 6 months with a schooner from Guayaquil<ref target="#foot.f15"/> if he could raise £500— I should think we could do this   it would be a splendid thing to do &amp; he is a capital man.</p>
<p>The weather has been cold &amp; comfortless but suitable on the whole for travelling. Mrs Hooker<ref target="#foot.f16"/> has stood it perfectly &amp; enjoyed herself amazingly, she sends love to you all—please add mine.</p>
<p>Ever my dear Darwin | Yours affec | J D Hooker</p>
<p>Clement Wedgwood &amp; his wife<ref target="#foot.f17"/> arrived before we left &amp; we spent a very happy day altogether</p>
