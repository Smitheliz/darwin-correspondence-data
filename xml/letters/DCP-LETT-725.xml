            <note xml:id="foot.f2">According to Dieffenbach an increase in diseases had occurred since the arrival of Europeans and the changes they brought about in the native way of life. ‘In one word, instead of an active, warlike race, they have become eaters of potatoes, neglecting their industrious pursuits in consequence of the facility of procuring food and blankets, and they pass their lives in eating, smoking, and sleeping. No medical man will deny that in this mode of living alone a sufficient cause is found to account for many of the diseases which prevail.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2036.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dieffenbach 1843</ref>, 2: 19–20).</note>
