            <p>Julius von Sachs will "swear &amp; curse" when he finds out he has missed sensitiveness of root apex. Has been putting his notes together and the case is conclusive. [Dated "Saturday 10th" by CD.]</p>

                    <p>It has only just occurred to me that you never gave in Nature the result of weighing the 2 lots of Drosera.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> This is a great pity &amp; I hope that you will do so as soon as you can, &amp; you can then add a few words on paper in Bot. Zeitung, of which I have now received a copy. The author seems rather injured that you fed the plants so much more carefully than he did.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Will you send to Down, as soon as you can spare it, the Part on Radicles by Sachs which you have, for I have read the other two Parts.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> It is a magnificent piece of work. He will swear &amp; curse when he finds out that he missed sensitiveness of apex.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have been putting together my notes &amp; the case is conclusive; but I have not nearly finished &amp; my account will be abominably long. Yet there are several points to ascertain.</p>
                    <p> It was a great misfortune that you threw away the notes about the failures; failures often prove as useful as successes.—</p>
                    <p>We go back on Monday &amp; have had a most prosperous visit.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> They are all here very kind &amp; sweet.— I often catch myself thinking of Bernard &amp; his pretty ways.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> It is dreadful to think of the orange which he was prevented from eating, &amp; I do hope it has been made up to him by many others.</p>

The first part, on radicles, or embryonic roots, appeared in issue 3 (1873); the second part, on taproots and adventitious roots, was published in issue 4 (1874).
