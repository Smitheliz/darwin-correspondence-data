                    <p>I received the book this morning &amp; have just turned over the pages &amp; looked at the wood-cuts.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am rather disappointed to see how carelessly they are printed; they are not comparable to the proofs I saw at home. I notice a slight mis-statement Fig 149 was not from a photo. And surely 147 was not either<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Fig 162 there <hi rend="underline">was</hi> a photog. but so blurred that I drew the left hand one almost entirely from the plant as I believe. The right hand one was drawn entirely from nature.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If I am not right in my memory of this I shall be enormously surprized &amp; especially I remember the right hand fig. of 149 because it was the hardest one which was done entirely from nature. However this is all very unimportant.</p>
                    <p>I have been going on with ripple-marks &amp; can now produce them in a flat bath with almost the regularity of a mathematical figure with wave lengths varying from perhaps 3 or 4 inches to <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> inch.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I can produce <hi rend="underline">no</hi> ripple mark with currents &amp; I believe that when ripple is produced along with current the current must be slow &amp; wave motion must be going on on the surface   I find a rough formula for wave length of ripple-mark as a multiple of the greatest velocity of the water relatively to the sand in the oscillatory motion. Also no ripple is produced if this max: vel: is less than <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> a ft per sec. &amp; again none if greater that 1.2 ft per sec. There is a marked tendency to sort the sand along the crests of the ripples.</p>
                    <p>I am inclined at present to think it is a complex affair partly depending on the rates at which different sized grains acquire the velocity of the water moving past them &amp; partly on my previous theory of the sand being elongated   I fancy I shall be able to reduce my apparatus so as to make absolutely regular ripples. They already are good. I got the other day 66 ripples round the bath with only one partially broken. The more I see the more I think Lyell utterly wrong.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am in despair about my astronomy. I am in this position that I <hi rend="underline">must</hi> refer to my  theory in its bearing on the solar system as a whole that I can not make any problem which shall reasonably represent the case &amp; that I must write a sort of general discussion which will I fear be very unsatisfactory &amp; will be more speculative than I like, and moreover I fear the outcome of the whole to any one who does not read thoro’ly will be more unfavourable to the theory than I am convinced it sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have been rather better for about a week now &amp; have worked spasmodically. My cold, quà cold, has much subsided, tho’ it is at me pretty vigorously in the usual way.</p>
<p>Arthur Balfour has been here for a few days, but he had’nt got very much politics to tell.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I dined last night at Horaces &amp; met Miss Gladstone &amp; afterwards we went to the Amateur Dramatic play.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> We went down in the tram-car in an awful crowd with Ida sitting on Miss G’s lap, &amp; then walked on thro’ the rain   We had a fearful storm of wind &amp; rain last night, all night thro’. &amp; only stayed at the play for two or three acts. It was’nt at all good &amp; I had seen it before—.</p>
                    <p>A.B. wants Horace to do another little job at Whittinghame but I don’t think it will be much—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> It is something wh H. had suggested before.</p>
<p>I am dining at F. Balfour’s tonight to meet Evans (J. E’s son) who is come back from Bosnia &amp; Ragusa for a short visit in England. I think you read his book.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">George had a special trough made to experiment on producing ripple-marks in sand covered by water (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12747.xml">letter from G. H.

His work demonstrated that the formation of irregular ripple marks was due to vortices carrying sand up the lee slope while the direct current moved sand up the weather slope.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml">Charles Lyell</ref> had discussed the production of ripple-marks in <hi rend="italic">A manual of elementary geology</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5015.xml">C. Lyell 1851</ref>, pp. 19–21). He accounted for ripple-marks in sand (under air) as a result of the direct action of the wind on the weather slope alone (see <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 20 fig. 9).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">George had written a series of papers on tidal friction and related subjects (see, for example, G. H.

This work related to the underlying problem of cosmic development; George presented a paper titled ‘On the tidal friction of a planet attended by several satellites, and on the evolution of the solar system’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11304.xml">G. H. Darwin 1881</ref>) in January 1881.
