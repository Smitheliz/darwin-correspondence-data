<p>It is only to-day we could send you the Second Volume of the french translation of your Descent of Man. Other copies of this volume have likewise been sent to Mess. Saporta, Charles Martins, and Prof Dareste.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>The heavy illness of your appointed translator Mr Moulinié gave us much trouble, as the manuscript of the second volume was not at all ready, when he failed. We had to work over again half of the Second volume, and in spite of all haste it was not possible to get faster on as we did—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Our trouble was still greater with the Origin of Species, which we begun it is nearly 3 years ago, and the printing of which was not only delayed by the war, but also by the publication of your sixth english edition and finally by the illness of the translator.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> We did our best to complete the book in the absence of the latter, and hope we will encounter your approval when the work will be ready for sale, what probably will be before the end of December, as we are about printing the end of the volume, the indexes and the historical introduction.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>If we succeed to sell speedily this our edition of the Origin of Species, we propose to get the book then published in a definite form as you did with the sixth english edition.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> We therefore intend then to get our translation revised by a man of authority in France, as perhaps Mr. Charles Martins or any of your personnal friends in this country. But it is of first necessity that then our desire will be backed by your personnal influence. It is however a great deal too early to speak of this now, as the book is not only not <hi rend="underline">out</hi> but very likely not very soon <hi rend="underline">out of print.</hi></p>
<p>We arranged with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pozzi for the translation of your new work <hi rend="underline">On the Emotions</hi> and are sure that his labor will be highly recommendable as for the french style and accuracy.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Nevertheless we should be much obliged if you would take the pain to receive the sheets when ready, and give your personnal consent to their printing. The author is no doubt more able as any one else to judge of the accuracy and truthfullness of the translation, and our first care above all is to give translation “<hi rend="underline">agréées par l’auteur.</hi>”<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>We should be happy to have the author of these books going with us in a percentage of the benefits, but we dare say that the interference of your hitherto appointed translator M. J. J. Moulinié was not to our mutual advantage. Col. Moulinié, by your largeness,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> was the legal proprietor of the copy right for french translation, and his labor was paid by us in consequence.— As soon as it will be possible to settle business with himself, or if he should henceforth be incapable of this care, with his legal representatives, we will inform you of the fact and agree with you for any new edition of your celebrated books which as we hope, are to be needed in future.</p>
<p>If you were in want of some copies of the french translation of the Descent of Man, we shall be happy to send them without delay.</p>
<p>We shall feel much satisfaction if the publication of our Second volume of the Descendance de l’Homme meets your approval, and hoping that it will be so, we remain | Dear Sir | your’s most obediently | C Reinwald &amp; Co</p>
