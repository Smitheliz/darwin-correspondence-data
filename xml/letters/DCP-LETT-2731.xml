            <p>Is pleased GHKT goes a little way with him.</p> 
<p>Has rectified in foreign editions of <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> his omission of an explanation of the failure of many forms to progress;</p> 
            <p>also has discussion of beauty in MS. Does GHKT really believe Diatomaceae, for instance, were created beautiful so that man, millions of generations later, should admire them through a microscope? CD attributes most of these structures to unknown laws of growth; useful structures are accounted for by natural selection.</p>

<p>I thank you very sincerely for your letter &amp; am <hi rend="doubleUnderline">much</hi> pleased that you go a little way with me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You will think it presumptuous, but I am well convinced from my own mental experience, that if you keep the subject at all before your mind, you will ultimately go further. The present vol. is mere abstract &amp; there are great omissions— one main one, which I have rectified in the foreign Editions is an explanation (which has satisfied Lyell, who made same objection with you) why many forms do not progress or advance.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> (&amp; I quite agree about some retrograding)— I have also M.S. discussion on beauty—but do you really suppose that for instance Diatomaceæ were created beautiful that man after millions of generations sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. admire them through the microscope?—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. attribute most of such structures to quite unknown laws of growth; &amp; mere repetition of parts is to our eyes one main element of beauty. When any structure is of use (&amp; I can show what curiously minute particulars are often of <hi rend="underline">highest</hi> use) I can see with my prejudiced eyes no limit to the perfection of the coadaptations which could be effected by natural selection.—</p>
<p>I rather doubt whether you see how far, as it seems to me, the argument from Homology &amp; Embryology may be carried. I do not look at this as mere analogy. I would as soon believe that fossil shells were mere mockeries of real shells, as that the same bones in foot of dog &amp; wing of bat—or the similar embryo of mammal &amp; bird—had not a direct signification &amp; that signification can be unity of descent or nothing. But I venture to repeat how much pleased I am that you go some little way with me. I find a number of naturalists do the same, &amp; as their halting places are various &amp; I must think arbitrary, I believe they will all go further. As for changing at once ones opinion; I would not value the opinion of a man who could do so: it must be a slow process.—</p>
<p>Thank you for telling me about the Lantana;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. at any time be most grateful for any information which you think would be of use to me.— I hope that you will publish a list of all naturalised plants in Ceylon, as far as known, carefully distinguishing those confined to cultivated soils <hi rend="underline">alone</hi>. I feel sure that this most important subject has been <hi rend="underline">greatly</hi> undervalued.</p>
<p>With hearty thanks for your letter | Believe me | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
