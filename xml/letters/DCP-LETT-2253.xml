<p>I am very much obliged for your note.— I have seen only an abstract in the Athenæum newspaper of your paper before Brit.

<p>I have read but little more of your Meteorology, but I found in that little several things which I was curious to know.— I have turned to the passage referred to, on which I have nothing to say, except that you have put the whole case of the transparency of the air quite in a new light to me.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>In regard to species, if forms which have all the ordinary characters of species, are given up as immutable beings so created, it is, I think, extremely difficult not to go very much further; but this is to too big a point to enlarge on, &amp; I am in a poor way today, having spent nearly all of it on the sofa; so goodbye &amp; believe me | Dear Jenyns | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I have had some correspondence with Buckman.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
