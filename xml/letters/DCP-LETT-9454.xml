<p>I was very glad to get your interesting letter which was not a word too long, &amp; did not tell me a thing which I did not wish to hear.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I opened the parcel before reading your letter &amp; speculated much how the quasi-drawings had been made, for I saw hairs &amp; scales on them. They are very curious &amp; if they can be produced cheaply, they would really be very valuable &amp; would tell anyone the names of the British Lepidoptera very quickly. I cannot conceive how they can be done, for the same butterfly or moth must I suppose serve for several copies. I do not know M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Merrin’s address else I would write &amp; thank him very sincerely.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Will you do this kind act for me, as I generally have such a lot of letters to write every day.— I will show the plates to any one interested in Nat. Hist. who may be here.—</p>
<p>I am glad to hear so good an account of yourself, &amp; as for one’s body growing old there is no help for it, &amp; I feel as old as Methusalem;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but not much in mind, except that I think one takes everything more quietly, as not signifying so much. And as you say one looks backwards much more than forwards &amp; can never expect to have nearly such keen enjoyment as in old days, as when we breakfasted together at Cambridge &amp; shot in Derbyshire. Do I remember Brachinus?<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Am I alive? Poor Albert Way I did not know that he was dead: it is a good job, for I have heard that his life &amp; mind have been wretched for some years.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Like you I always associate my Father with his gardens, &amp; <hi rend="underline">last</hi> evening was speaking to Emma about his sitting so long in the garden listening to the Birds singing. You ask about Caroline: she is aged in her body &amp; infirm, but very brisk in mind: a few days ago, another daughter was married, &amp; now the old pair will be left with only one nestling, &amp; this will be dull for the House.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> You ask also about myself: I have been rather better of late, but I never pass six hours without much discomfort; &amp; I forget myself only when I am at work. I have just finished correcting new Editions of my Descent of Man &amp; Coral Reefs; &amp; this is very tedious work, &amp; I am delighted to be at new investigations. I am preparing a book almost wholly on Drosera or the Sun-Dew,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> which is a wonderful plant under a physiological point of view, &amp; I think I have made some curious discoveries. One of the chief new points is that it secretes a fluid analogous to gastric juice, for it contains a ferment, closely analogous to pepsine, with an acid, &amp; can thus in a few hours dissolve the hardest cartilage, bone &amp; meat &amp;c. &amp;c.—</p>
<p>I shall never have strength &amp; life to complete more of the series of books in relation to the Origin, of which I have the M.S. half completed; but I have started the subject &amp; that must be enough for me.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>It will be job for you to decipher this scrawl. Farewell my dear old friend— My wife sends her very kind remembrances &amp; do pay us a visit whenever you can. | Farewell yours affectionately | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>My son’s Bank is in High St “Hawkinson, Atherley &amp; Darwin”   it is a very flourishing concern.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>My son George, I fear, is a confirmed invalid &amp; has given up the law— My third is going to be married &amp; will be my Secretary.— Leonard R.E. is going to N. Zealand on the Venus Expedition. Horace is working in an Engineers Workshop, but is often unwell.— Hereditary ill-health.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
