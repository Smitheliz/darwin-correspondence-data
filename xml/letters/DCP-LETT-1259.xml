                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I am sincerely obliged to you for your very kind letter, &amp; the information sent. I am sure from what you say, that had it been in your power you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have assisted me with specimens.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I was not aware that you had attended to the Cirripedia,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> otherwise I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have had greater scruple in applying to you.— Your’s was indeed a grand voyage, &amp; your range of research a wide one: I have always felt much interested in regard to your classification &amp;c of the corals; I dissected enough to see what a famous field there was open. Indeed I had intended working on this subject, but my miserable health for the last ten years, (which has lost me much more than half my time) has interrupted all my former hopes &amp; designs.—</p>
<p>You cannot imagine how much gratified I have been, that you have, to a certain extent agreed with my coral-island-notions.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>To return to the cirripedia: I am allowed to work only 2 hours daily (after 5 months doing nothing) so that it will be long before I publish: the cirripedia are moreover very troublesome, from their great variability, &amp; the necessity of examining whole animal &amp; inside &amp; outside of shell.— Possibly you may publish your specimens before my monograph; in that case w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> it be possible for me to see any duplicates; or in no case must be sent out of the country?—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Your Sporillus<ref target="#foot.f5"/> sounds very curious; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. really like to know whether it is absolutely loose &amp; unattached amongst the sea-weed.—</p>
<p>I am particularly obliged to you for pointing out to me your notice on the metamorphosis of the cirripedia in Silliman’s Journal,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> for I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have overlooked it.— You have to a certain extent forestalled me, though we do not take quite the same view on the homologies of the parts.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I have, I think, worked out the anatomy of the larva in considerable detail &amp; I hope correctly.—</p>
<p>I have seen D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Leidy’s eyes in several genera;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> indeed I had seen &amp; noted them as “like eyes” before reading his paper; but I do not suppose I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have followed out what I had seen, had it not been for D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Leidy; for these organs are very minute &amp; rudimentary.—</p>
<p>I quite agree with you that the cirripedia are Crustacea— I have lately got a Suctorial form, which bears about same relation to common cirripedia, as Lernæa does to common Crustacea.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Once again allow me to thank you for the kindness &amp; frankness of your letter, &amp; believe me, dear Sir, with every good wish &amp; much sympathy | Yours sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S | I wrote to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Baird<ref target="#foot.f10"/> &amp; have just received an answer, begging me to thank you very sincerely for your most kind offer &amp; say how very glad he should be to have the tracings.— His address is “D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Baird British Museum London”.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. B. tells me in his letter that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Westwood is going to publish a work on the <hi rend="underline">British</hi> Edriophthalmic Crustacea, in continuation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell’s work,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> &amp; that he was at the British Museum, when my note arrived &amp; that he expressed a strong wish to know whether you have described new genera in this division.— If you chose to forward any thing to him; you c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. do so under cover to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Baird: no doubt you are aware how good &amp; sound an Entomologist Westwood is.—</p>

CD, however, maintained that the peduncle and all the externally visible parts of Cirripedia corresponded to the three anterior segments of the head of a crustacean. CD further believed that the prehensile antennae were associated with the fronto-lateral horns of the larvae and that they developed into the means of attachment for the organism (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851): </ref>9–10, 28).
