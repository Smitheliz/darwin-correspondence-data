                    <p>Common as you may regard <hi rend="underline">Oxalis corniculata</hi>, it was not that I <hi rend="underline">intended</hi> to ask for, but a commoner, the wood-sorrel!—<hi rend="underline">O. Acetosella</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I had no idea you were away from home— I fear I have bothered you in vain by stupidly asking for the wrong plant (it has not come yet)— however I cannot regret having got so long a letter from you, &amp; with something of yourself in it too.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I quite understand your misery at finding yourself where you have “all play” offered you, &amp; no work to fall back upon!— I should be as bad; but then I know not the condition.— When I go away I have work that I can always take with me, official &amp; other: &amp; my misery is the lots accumulating at home. I cannot tell you how I long to throw off the trammels of official life &amp; do like Bentham:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> it is horrid at 63 after 42 years of Public Service too, to have to work on a pot-boiler over &amp; above official hours.— but then it is my own fault.— a man who marries &amp; has a family late in life <hi rend="underline">must</hi> <hi rend="underline">pay for it</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>I hear that, Greg is dying.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Mr &amp; Mrs Symonds (my wifes parents) are here, &amp; insist on the children going to them in the holidays so that we shall not want a summer quarters at Knockholt or elsewhere<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>So poor Rolleston is dead!. His wife is I hear suffering from acute mania, but some at any rate of her medical attendants regard it as temporary— they have 7 children, &amp; the eldest only 17.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> We have lost no end of friends this year, &amp; it is difficult to resist the pessimistic view of creation— when I look back however, &amp; especially my beloved friend to the days I have spent in intercourse with you &amp; your’s, that view takes wings to itself &amp; flies away: it is a horrid world to be sure, but it could have been worse.</p>
                    <p>I am sore exercised about my address for York:—of which I fear you will hear more than you will care for during incubation.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
