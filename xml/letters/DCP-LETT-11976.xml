                    <p>I am much interested to hear that you are bringing out another Life of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin, I write to say that as there is no Photogr<hi rend="superscript">ph</hi>. of Breadsall Priory, and as I am an artist in a small way, I shall be delighted to make as good a drawing in pen &amp; ink as I can, and with the judicious emendations which are generally made by such woodengravers as your publisher w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. employ, I am sure it would be a pretty view.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>You must not trouble yourself to answer this unless you have some suggestion or wish to express—(much as I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. value a line from you), and I will forward the drawing before the end of this month, if that will do.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I wish much that the plate of that beautiful little engraving of Wright’s portrait c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be found— I only lately discovered that it was by one of the M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wedgwoods, in purchasing it at a chance sale here. I believe it was originally made for “Seward’s Anecdotes”.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It would photograph perfectly though, as all prints do. The photos from the original picture are very poor &amp; blotched, &amp; are therefore out of the question.</p>
                    <p>It is remarkable how the word “benevolent” has always been associated with D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin by his friends (almost like the “<hi rend="underline">judicious</hi> Hooker!’)<ref target="#foot.f4"/> There is a fine &amp; unusual instance of it in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Edgeworth’s Memoirs. V. 1. p 163–4 and V. 2. p 198—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Also in the Mem<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. of <hi rend="underline">Miss</hi> Edgworth, published privately— She says, describing a visit to the Priory after D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D’s death—“There was a charming picture of him in the room, in which his generous soul appeared, and his penetrating <hi rend="underline">benevolent</hi> genius”.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> vol. 1 p 112   His great Temperance is well known—from the anecdote of his addressing the Nottingham people on the subject<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I must not trespass further, &amp; with kind regards | believe me | yours very sincerely | Violetta H. Darwin—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD was preparing a character sketch of his grandfather Erasmus Darwin to accompany an English translation of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2758.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ernst Krause’s</ref> discussion of the works of Erasmus Darwin (Krause 1879a). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4303.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Anna Seward</ref> had published a biography of Erasmus Darwin in 1804 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7126.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Seward 1804</ref>). CD wished to include a woodcut of Breadsall Priory, Erasmus Darwin’s death place, in his sketch (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11966.xml">letter to Reginald Darwin, 1 April 1879</ref>). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1796.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Violetta Darwin</ref> was a book illustrator and member of the Anastatic Drawing Society, the purpose of which was to ‘delineate remains of antiquity’ (<hi rend="italic">Anastatic Drawing Society</hi> (1858): iii and vi). In 1858, when she was still living at Breadsall Priory, she published a drawing of parts of Breadsall Church and the Priory (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., plate 19).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1796.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Violetta Darwin’s</ref> drawing of Breadsall Priory was used in <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>, p. 125.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5257.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Wright</ref> of Derby painted several portraits of Erasmus Darwin (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4339.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">M. Keynes 1994</ref>). The engraving, probably by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8775.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Allen</ref> Wedgwood, was taken from a portrait painted in 1770 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11980.xml">letter from Reginald Darwin, 7 April 1879</ref>); no portrait is reproduced in <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4303.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Anna Seward’s</ref> <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the life of Dr. Darwin ... with anecdotes of his friends</hi>, but she commented on the 1770 painting (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7126.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Seward 1804</ref>, p. 21). CD used an engraving, published by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8438.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Raphael Smith</ref> in 1797, of one of two versions of a later portrait by Wright of Erasmus Darwin holding a quill as the frontispiece to <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD gave several examples of Erasmus Darwin’s benevolence in <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>, pp. 34–5 and 60–5. The sixteenth-century theologian <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8436.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Hooker</ref> was referred to as judicious by his later followers, who admired his moderation (<hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8398.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</ref> recalled Erasmus Darwin’s rescue from a ditch of a drunken man, whom he brought back to his home to care for overnight, only to discover that it was his brother-in-law (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10685.xml">R. L. Edgeworth and Edgeworth 1820</ref>, 1: 163–4). Edgeworth also mentioned in 1798 that Erasmus Darwin’s expression in a recent portrait obscured his benevolence (R. L. Edgeworth and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10685.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Edgeworth 1820</ref>, 2: 198). CD referred to both stories in <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>, pp. 60–1 and 69.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1452.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Maria Edgeworth</ref> visited Breadsall Priory in September 1802; Erasmus Darwin had died in April 1802, and the household was in deep mourning (F. A. Edgeworth ed. 1867, 1: 112). The portrait was probably Wright’s 1770 painting, which was sold to CD in 1877 (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 26, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11309F.xml">letter from E. A. Greaves, 3 January 1878</ref>; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4339.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">M. Keynes 1994</ref>, pp. 70–2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">According to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7126.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Seward 1804</ref>, pp. 64–8, Erasmus Darwin, having uncharacteristically indulged in alcohol during a boating trip with friends to Nottingham, stepped overboard, swam to shore, and walked into the town, where he addressed working men on the benefits of fresh air as well as sobriety; he then returned to his friends and resumed the boat trip. This anecdote appeared in <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin</hi>, pp. 58–9, but CD considered the address published by Seward to be her own invention, and suggested that Erasmus Darwin might have been tricked into taking strong drink by his friends.</note>
