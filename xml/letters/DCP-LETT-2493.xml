<p>His book [<hi rend="italic">Origin</hi>] is nearly done. Is not so silly as to expect to convert WDF. Lyell is wavering; Hooker has come round.</p>

            <p>Asks WDF to find out if a cross between differently coloured horses produces a dun.</p>

<p>I was very glad to get your letter a few days ago. I was wishing to hear about you, but have been in such an absorbed, slavish, overworked state, that I had not heart without compulsion to write to anyone or do anything, beyond my daily work.— Though your account of yourself is better, I cannot think it all satisfactory, &amp; I wish you could soon go to Malvern again.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> My Father used to believe largely in an old saying that if a man grew thinner between 50 &amp; 60 years of age his chance of long life was poor, &amp; that on the contrary it was a very good sign if he grew fatter;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> so that your stoutness, I look at as very good omen.—</p>
<p>My health has been as bad as it well could be all this summer; &amp; I have kept on my legs, only by going at short intervals to Moor Park; but I have been better lately, &amp; thank Heavens, I have at last as good as done my Book, having only the index &amp; two or three Revises to do.— It will be published in 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> week in November &amp; a copy shall be sent you.— Remember it is only an Abstract (but has cost me above 13 months to write!!) &amp; facts &amp; authorities are far from given in full. I shall be curious to hear what you think of it, but I am not so silly as to expect to convert you.— Lyell has read about half of the volume in clean sheets &amp; gives me very great kudos.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He is wavering so much about the immutability of species; that I expect he will come round.— Hooker has come round &amp; will publish his belief soon—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>So much for my abominable volume, which has cost me so much labour that I almost hate it.—</p>
<p>On October 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. I start for Ilkley but shall take 3 days for journey! It is so late that we shall not take house; but I go there alone for 3 or 4 weeks; then return home for a week &amp; go to Moor Park for 3 or 4 weeks, &amp; thus I shall get a moderate spell of Hydropathy; &amp; I intend, if I can keep to my resolution of being idle this winter. But I fear ennui will be as bad as a bad stomach.— Emma has suffered much from headach of late; but I hope will soon be better.— I very much fear that my eldest girl Etty will never be strong; &amp; Lenny has been often ailing for last 2 years with intermittent (but only symptomatically so) pulse.— My poor constitution like everything else is transmitted by inheritance.—</p>
<p>My eldest two Boys give me in every way much satisfaction.</p>
<p>Farewell my dear old friend. I truly hope that you will steadily get stronger. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. much like another note before very long. Farewell | Ever yours affect<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Remember if ever you can find out whether a cross between any two coloured horses produces a dun, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. particularly wish to hear.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
