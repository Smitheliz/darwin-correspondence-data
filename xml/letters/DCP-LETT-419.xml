<p>I have been in great trepidation for the last fortnight at the thoughts of receiving a letter from you: for the fossils only came to my house three days since. The casts were to have come yesterday, but have not yet. I do not doubt, however, I shall have them directly.— My chief object in writing now is to tell you than in a week, or 10 days, or at most a fortnight I leave London for about five weeks, so that if you want the fossils &amp; casts sent anywhere you must let me know at once, or leave them till the beginning of August, when I shall be back here.— Owen was annoyed at having been the cause of the delay: but in fact he is worked out of life &amp; soul. He has sent me a letter to forward to you, which I have not done, thinking I would wait, till I heard, whether you chose to have the fossils sent to you; or what plan was decided on.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Although I was in great fears at seeing your handwriting until I had the fossils safe &amp; sound, yet I have at the same time been wishing <hi rend="underline">very much</hi> to hear how Delamere gets on.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You must give up an hour of one of your solitary evenings, (for I suppose M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Fox has not yet joined you) &amp; give me long account, of place &amp; people.</p>
<p>I have not been very well of late, which has suddenly determined me to leave London earlier than I had anticipated. I go by the steam-packet to Edinburgh.—take a solitary walk on Salisbury crags &amp; call up old thoughts of former times<ref target="#foot.f3"/> then go on to Glasgow &amp; the great valley of Inverness,—near which I intend stopping a week to geologise the parallel roads of Glen Roy,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> —thence to Shrewsbury, Maer for one day, &amp; London for smoke, ill health &amp; hard work.—</p>
<p>Catherine came back yesterday from Paris, where she has been staying with party of Wedgwoods for a month— She stays a week in London &amp; then returns 〈to〉 Shrewsbury.—</p>
<p>I am going today to dine at the great Herschel dinner, which you probably will have seen announced in the Papers.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> it will, I am afraid be stupid but I trust Sir J. will give us some account, of his discoveries.—</p>
<p>My journal will not be out until the Autumn, I am crawling on with the geology,—but the Zoological parts<ref target="#foot.f6"/> murder much of my time.—</p>
<p>I am delighted to hear, you are such a good man, as not to have forgotten my questions about the crossing of animals. It is my prime hobby &amp; I really think some day, I shall be able to do something on that most intricate subject species &amp; varieties.</p>
<p>Good Bye my dear old Fox— make a noble return to this excessively stupid letter, &amp; tell me all the &amp;cc of Delamere. Yours most Sincerely | Chas. Darwin</p>
