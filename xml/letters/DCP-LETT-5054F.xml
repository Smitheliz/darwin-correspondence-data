<p>I have not heard from Mr. Schweizerbart so cannot give a definitive answer to your father; but the more I think on the subject the more I feel that I am bound not in any way to support another edition.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> For this reason <hi rend="underline">alone</hi> I am sorry to say that I cannot offer to send clean sheets of the new English edition of the Origin as they are printed off; and the corrections &amp; additions are so numerous that they c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be sent in no other way<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>With respect to your enquiry about my other works; in your list you give the same book twice over with different titles.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> My Journal of Researches &amp;c was translated in 1844 into German by Dr. Diefenbach (Viewig &amp; Sons Braunschweig) but the translation was made from the first English edition.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The 2nd Ed. was considerably condensed &amp; improved &amp; was published under the above title of ‘Journal of Researches’ &amp; has had so very large a sale in English (viz. 10,000 copies) that it might possibly be worth re-translating into German.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle is a very large book with most expensive illustrations.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> My work on Cirripedia consists of 2 thick Vols with numerous illustrations.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> It is obviously out of the question to think of translating either of these works. My geological works consist of 3 thin Vols, now I believe always sold by Smith &amp; Elder bound together in one thick Vol.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> These consist of ‘The Structure &amp; distribution of Coral Reefs.’ This is a work of some interest, &amp; if my name had formerly been known in Germany and have been worth translation. The other two parts consist of ‘Geological observe. on Volcanic Island’ &amp; ‘Geolog. Observ. on South America.’ My work on the contrivances by which orchids are fertilized has been translated into German—at towards the close of last year I published in the Journal of the Linnean Soc. &amp; separately a little book on the ‘Movements &amp; habits of Climbing Plants,’ of which I send you a copy.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I cannot suppose that this wd be worth translation, although formerly 2 little books appeared in Germany on this subject,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> &amp; I may add that this treatise has been highly spoken of by Botanists. If it were translated, which I repeat I do not think wd answer, it might be worth while to add Three papers by me published in the Linnean Journal on a very curious subject namely Dimorphism &amp; Trimorphism in plants &amp; which has been a good deal discussed in German scientific periodicals.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I will write again as soon as I hear from M. Schweizerbart but I have hardly any doubt that he will agree to my proposals—</p>
<p>Believe me dear Sir | yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>
