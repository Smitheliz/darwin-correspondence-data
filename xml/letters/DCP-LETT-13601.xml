                    <p>With very great pleasure have I completely perused the vol you kindly sent me on “Worms”.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> There are many interesting sections which suggest far reaching inferences &amp; hypotheses. I have however scarcely any hope of being able to string together some which have occurred to me,—other circumstances hindering. All I can do now,—which will bespeak the careful interest of my study of the vol,—might be to give you a memo of several printers’ &amp;c slips which you might desire to have corrected in a newer Edition. There were certainly one or 2 paragphs which I did not see the force of at first, &amp; for my own benefit I have interlineated what I took to be the construction of the passage. It would be egotistic ill taste to name such, except to say—they are at your command, with the assumed chance of my being entirely wrong. The eloquent summary of the last chapter is very striking, &amp;, I imagined, contains several <hi rend="underline">new</hi> facts not found in the pre-going pages, particularly the <hi rend="underline">first part of the last sentence</hi> on page 311.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have watched with great interest lately the building up of a “tower” casting in our little garden. Morning by morning it shows a new deposit of its viscid-“lava” on the summit, whence it rolls down the sides. I protected it some days ago with flower pot sticks. In spite of the recent very heavy rains, it goes on augmenting, &amp; I think, if I sliced it fairly off the normal surface of the ground, it would measure nearly 2 inches high, &amp; this too in spite of the loss from the rain washing part of it away every day. The distinctness of the castings on summit suggests a “colony” of worms.</p>
<p>I picked up a recent casting about 7 or 8 days ago. It had already hardened. I was astonished at its cohesion. The pebbly corrugation was plain &amp; natural, bespeaking a <hi rend="underline">recent</hi> casting. It withstood a comparative effort to pull its pebbles asunder. I dropped it (perhaps from a foot high) upon some <hi rend="underline">hard earth</hi> in a flower pot but it did not break. I left it there. Several times subseq<hi rend="superscript">tly</hi> I examined it. In spite of heavy rain it still held well together but was losing size gradually. Every disintegration of <hi rend="underline">outer</hi> pebbles always revealed <hi rend="underline">among the inner ones</hi>, those bits of <hi rend="underline">stony</hi> fragments of which you speak. There still remains of it, a <hi rend="underline">firmly bound-together</hi> accretion.</p>
<p>I have been a little puzzled by the different nature <hi rend="underline">of the distribution</hi> of castings on a flat &amp; on a slope. On a few square feet of front ground the castings <hi rend="underline">on the</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">level</hi> are in lines &amp; angles 
    <figure rend="inline width33">
        <graphic url="../images/dcp_lett_13601.jpg"/>
    </figure> 
                    &amp;c <hi rend="underline">&amp; not all over</hi>; but on the <hi rend="underline">slope</hi> the honeycombed surface is <hi rend="underline">equally covered</hi> almost over its entire area. An explanation occurs to me which seems to answer one of your queries in part. It is as to their instinct in reference to burrowing at right angles (p. 270) as the shortest course for bringing up earth.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> This may be undetermined, but if they do not burrow at right angles, still, by <hi rend="underline">preferring</hi> slopes they find the advantage of such an “economy” in another sense—i.e. the <hi rend="underline">angle</hi> of the sloping ground being more convenient to eject earth <hi rend="underline">upon</hi> than throwing it up <hi rend="underline">perpendicularly</hi> as would be the case on a level.</p>
                    <p>I could not decide on the weight of evidence as to the purposes &amp;c of plugging &amp;c (p. 63) in my mind until I came to p. 116, where the “respiration” point (lines 11 to 13) seems to settle the argument most conclusively.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>Recent science &amp; travel seems to qualify p 232 somewhat, considering Prof Ball’s recent calculations as to pre-historic “Waves of the Sea”; as also p 238, the “<hi rend="underline">Vega’s</hi>” Voyage (also see Prof Plummer’s paper “Goodword’s Dec 1881) seems to establish a <hi rend="underline">great deal</hi> of cosmic dust as falling in the Arctic regions.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>I fear, Sir, I have troubled you too much upon these little points. You must forgive me the trespass on your valuable time &amp; permit me to remain | Yours very faithfully | J. F. Simpson <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

                    <p>A writer last week in the same columns adopted the rather questionable feeling of throwing derision upon a certain class of people who draw rather free inferences from what they read in favour of some cherished idea or persuasion. It is a trait common to all human beings according to their respective “bent” &amp;c, &amp; to attack it in an unseemly manner is unworthy of a scientific man. Hence arose my few lines signed “A Community of Worms”, which the Editor seems unwisely to have sent <hi rend="underline">specially</hi> on. I am in no dread of any one reading the first writer’s rejoinder. It is unkind, &amp; the arrogance he speaks of was <hi rend="underline">on his side in his</hi> first letter. The only notice I take of his gratuitously uncalled for rejoinder is to tell the Editor that I do not bow down to his friend’s scientific dicta on any “infallibility” grounds, &amp; (as he seems to be a primed geologist of the rigid Lyell school)<ref target="#foot.f8"/> that very recent science is tearing the old geologically computed periods into shreds.</p>
<p>I am of course but a very Empirical observer &amp;c, &amp; under such comments it is as well to be as pachydermatous as possible, <hi rend="underline">with all</hi> one’s faults.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD had sent a copy of the fifth thousand of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref>, which included observations by Simpson (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 29, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13524.xml">letter from J. F. Simpson, 1 December 1881</ref> and n. 1).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In his conclusion to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref>, CD emphasised the value of worm activity for horticulture. The last sentence on p. 311 reads: ‘Many seeds owe their germination to having been covered by castings; and others buried to a considerable depth beneath accumulated castings lie dormant, until at some future time they are accidentally uncovered and germinate.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD had noted the advantages of excavation ‘at right angles to an inclined surface’ in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref>, p. 270.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD suggested that worms lined their burrows with little stones and seeds to prevent their bodies coming in close contact with the cold soil, as ‘such contact would perhaps interfere with their respiration which is effected by the skin alone’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref>, p. 116).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref>, pp. 232–3, CD discussed the role of wind, rain, and rivers as causes of denudation alongside ocean waves; he also cited a number of geological works on the accumulation of dust in certain conditions, including meteoric dust (<hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi>, pp. 236–8). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_262.xml">Robert Stawell Ball</ref> had recently argued that ancient tides were substantially more powerful owing to the closer proximity of the moon to the earth (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11429.xml">Ball 1881</ref>, pp. 103–4). On cosmic dust, see <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_7467.xml">Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">The voyage of the Vega round Asia</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11401.xml">Nordenskiöld 1881</ref>, 1: 324–31). <hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi> (1881), contained an article on meteors by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_9370.xml">John Isaac Plummer</ref>, with remarks on the accumulation of meteoric dust (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11541.xml">Plummer 1881</ref>, p. 853).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">The spelling and grammatical mistakes on pp. 258 and 282 were corrected in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2241.xml"><hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi></ref> (sixth thousand), pp. 261, 285.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The enclosure from the <hi rend="italic">Paddington, Kensington and Bayswater Chronicle</hi> has not been found. </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml">Charles Lyell</ref> had argued that geological phenomena should be explained solely by the action of causes still in operation, and at their current intensities. On Lyell’s role in these debates about geological causes, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7067.xml">Secord 1997</ref>.</note>
