<p>My dear Ansted,</p>
<p>As I am away from home in consequence of my daughter’s health, I do not know your address, and fly this at random, and it is of very little consequence if it never reaches you.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have just been reading the greater part of your ‘Geological Gossip,’ and have found part very interesting; but I want to express my admiration at the clear and correct manner in which you have given a sketch of natural selection.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You will think this very slight praise; but I declare that the majority of readers seem utterly incapable of comprehending my long argument. Some of the reviewers, who have servilely stuck to my illustrations and almost to my words, have been correct, but extraordinarily few others have succeeded. I can see plainly, by your new illustrations and manner and order of putting the case, that you thoroughly comprehend the subject. I assure you this is most gratifying to me, and it is the sole way in which the public can be indoctrinated. I am often in despair in making the generality of naturalists even comprehend me. Intelligent men who are not naturalists and have not a bigoted idea of the term species, show more clearness of mind. I think that you have done the subject a real service, and I sincerely thank you. No doubt there will be much error found in my book, but I have great confidence that the main view will be, in time, found correct; for I find, without exception, that those naturalists who went at first one inch with me now go a foot or yard with me.</p>
<p>This note obviously requires no answer.</p>
<p>Pray believe me, | Yours sincerely, | C. Darwin.</p>
