<p>CD has been abused in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> for "amazing ignorance".</p>

<p>I fear that you never republish articles which have appeared in foreign journals, But one on Language has just been published in the N. American Rev. for July, by a distinguished philologist Prof. Whitney, who has sent it to me.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> In this he answers in a very able manner, as it appears to me, Max Müller’s views which were published by you,<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>As a writer in the July number of our Quarterly has abused me in strong words, “amazing ignorance” &amp;c for what little I have said on the development of language,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I much desire to see Whitney’s article republished in England.</p>
<p>I hope that you will not think it impertinent on my part to offer gladly to pay the expenses of printing, if this w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> make any difference in the publisher’s inclination to let it appear in so excellent a journal as the Contemporary.</p>
<p>I would send the article for your judgment, but if you have a fixed rule against republication this w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> only cause you additional trouble.</p>
<p>One word in answer wd suffice—</p>
<p>If you consent to republish I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> at once write to Prof. Whitney, &amp; take the responsibility of the affair on my own shoulders—</p>
<p>Dear Sir | yours faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>
