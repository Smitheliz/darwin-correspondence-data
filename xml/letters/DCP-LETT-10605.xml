<p>I have received both your letters here, &amp; thank you much for the details you send me; sad as they are the news that the sufferer was wholly unaware of her approaching end is wonderfully consolatory—to the survivors. I never think of my poor wife’s &amp; child’s ends without realizing this.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am so glad to hear that Frank will live with you poor fellow I do most deeply feel for him.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He is young however, of a happy disposition I believe, &amp; above all he is one who can find occupation for his mind &amp; take pleasure in the happyness of others.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the kind word about remarriage that Mrs Darwin sent to me on hearing of my being about to marry again;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; I cannot (though so far too soon to think of such a matter at all in respect of poor Frank) but hold the prospect for him deep down in a far off corner of my heart.</p>
<p>For my own part I am sure that I have done right—. &amp; that I shall feel as proud of my second wife as I ought to be— she is so gentle, sensible &amp; so thoroughly dependable. She is also as interested in my pursuits as I could wish, &amp; makes our walks so pleasant in all ways. A more affectionate nature I never met, &amp; she has quite endeared herself to all my kin in Scotland.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>From Glasgow we went first to Miss Smiths (of Jordan Hill) on the Clyde, whence I think I wrote to you— Then to Oban where we joined Mrs Lyell who was travelling with Rosamund, Arthur, Miss Lyell (Sophy, Sir Charles’ youngest sister &amp; Mr Symonds.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> We went together to Skye, spent nearly a week there &amp; crossed to the <hi rend="italic">[</hi>Garie<hi rend="italic">]</hi> Loch<ref target="#foot.f7"/> where we parted company &amp; my wife &amp; I came on here. We have had glorious weather &amp; a most pleasant trip.</p>
<p>The British Association was good on the whole, but Taits attack on Tyndall was not only unwarrantable but shameful &amp; Wallace as Presiding Spiritualist made a black ending to a scientific meeting.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I have been immensely struck with the Geological &amp; especially the glacial features of the N. of Scotland, &amp; begin to appreciate the difficult nature &amp; the amount of work accomplished by Macculloch &amp; subsequently by Murchison, in these regions<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Were you aware that Dickie of Aberdeen (Prof: Bot.) had examined the earth beneath the Glen Roy roads &amp; found them to contain <hi rend="underline">Fresh-water</hi> diatoms?<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>We go hence on Wednesday to Stirling for 3 days &amp; then on to my friends the Hodgsons in Gloucestershire for a few more when we shall meet Harriet &amp;—so home to Kew—where I shall be glad to be again.: though I must confess that the prospect of another such season as last of work in councils, committees Societys, &amp; <hi rend="underline">Society</hi> is peculiarly repulsive.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I have to get out a new Edition of the British Flora<ref target="#foot.f12"/>   I need hardly ask whether you have any notes or hints to give me</p>
<p>Hoping that time is doing it’s great work effectually in assuaging your own &amp; poor Franks grief. | Believe me my dear Darwin | Your ever affectionate | Jos D Hooker.</p>
<p>I have ventured to enclose a few lines for Frank, but pray do not give him them if you think it not good for me to write to him yet—.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>

Although <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4839.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Tyndall</ref> was not mentioned in the lecture, Hooker evidently interpreted parts of it as a veiled attack on Tyndall (for more on the long-standing dispute between Tait and Tyndall concerning the earliest formulation of the principle of conservation of energy, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9384.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">D. Lindley 2004</ref>, pp. 177–87). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4935.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Russel Wallace</ref> had been president of the biology section at the meeting. The precise incident alluded to by Hooker has not been identified, but in his address to the biological section of the meeting, Wallace had argued that the origin of humans must have been due in part to ‘distinct and higher agencies’, given the superiority of their mental and moral nature (<hi rend="italic">Report of the 46th meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science</hi> (1876), Transactions of the sections, p. 114). By this time, Wallace was publicly promoting spiritualism; see, for example, ‘A defence of modern spiritualism’ (Wallace 1874).</note>
