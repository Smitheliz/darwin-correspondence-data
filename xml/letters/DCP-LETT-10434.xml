            <p>James Paget’s scepticism about regrowth of digits. Suggests RLT experiment with amputation of digits, both extra and normal, of kittens and fowls. Fears they will fail to regrow, but, if regrowth is proved, it will be an important discovery.</p>

<p>Sir J. Paget has not published on the subject, but took extraordinary trouble in corresponding with various eminent surgeons &amp; writing to me.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> He gave me particulars of some degree of regrowth especially of the humerus in children, but disbelieves in a digit being ever reproduced. He goes so far as to suspect that when even a nail is reproduced part of the matrix has been left; but I cannot avoid thinking that he is in this respect over sceptical. I sent him full particulars &amp; tracings of the two cases which had been communicated to me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I send by this post D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rudinger’s essay which I advise you to read<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I think your intention of amputating the extra digit of a kitten is an excellent idea. Could not you try also on a Dorking fowl. I suppose that you would keep the amputated little toe in spirits; and then if there were re-growth, you could give drawings of the bones of the first digit &amp; of the regrowth   I would suggest your amputating one of the ordinary toes at the same time as a control experiment.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am glad you are examining tail-less animals, but it would not be worth while to send me the specimens, as I have not sufficient knowledge &amp; am much engaged with other subjects.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I fear that you will fail about regrowth, but if you can prove it the discovery will be an interesting one.</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
