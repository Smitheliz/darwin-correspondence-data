                    <p>Your letter has interested me greatly, as have so many during many past years. I thought that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not object to my publishing in Nature some of the more striking facts about the movements of Plants, with a few remarks added to show the bearing of the facts. The case of the Phyllanthus which sometimes turns up its leaves on the wrong side is most extraordinary &amp; ought to be further investigated.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Do the leaflets sleep on the following night in the usual manner? Do the same leaflets on successive nights move in the same strange manner? I was particularly glad to hear of the strongly marked cases of paraheliotropism.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I shall look out with much interest for the publication about the Figs. The creatures which you sketch are marvellous &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not have guessed that they were Hymenoptera.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Thirty or forty years ago I read all that I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. find about caprification &amp; was <hi rend="underline">utterly</hi> puzzled.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I suggested to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Crüger in Trinidad to investigate the wild figs, in relation to their cross-fertilisation, &amp; just before he died he wrote that he had arrived at some very curious results, but he never published, as I believe on the subject.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am extremely glad that the inundation did not so greatly injure your scientific property; though it would have been a real pleasure to me to have been allowed to have replaced your scientific apparatus.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I do not believe that there is anyone in the world who admires your zeal in science &amp; wonderful powers of observation more than I do.— I venture to say this, as I feel myself a very old man, who probably will not last much longer.</p>
<p>Believe me, my dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. With respect to Phyllanthus, I think that it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be good experiment to cut off most of the leaflets on one side of petiole, as soon as they are asleep &amp; vertically dependent.— When the pressure is thus removed, the opposite leaflets will perhaps bend beyond their vertically dependent position; if not, the main petiole might be a little twisted so that the upper surfaces of the dependent &amp; now unprotected leaflets sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. face obliquely the sky, when the morning comes. In this case diaheliotropism would perhaps conquer the ordinary movements of the leaves when they awake &amp; resume their diurnal horizontal position.— As the leaflets are alternate &amp; as the upper surface will be somewhat exposed to the dawning light it is perhaps diaheliotropism which explains your extraordinary case.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
