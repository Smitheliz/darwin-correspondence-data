<p>I finished your Elephant paper last night<ref target="#foot.f2"/> and you must let me express my admiration at it. All the points strike me as admirably worked out, and very many most interesting. I was particularly struck with your remarks on the character of the ancient Mammalian Fauna of N. America; it agrees with all I fancied was the case, namely a temporary irruption of S. American forms into N. America, and conversely.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I chuckled a little over the specimen of M. Andium “hesitating” between the two groups.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have been assured by Mr. Wallace that abundant Mastodon remains have been found at Timor, and that is rather close to Australia:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I rejoice that you have smashed that case.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It is indeed a grand paper. I will say nothing more about your allusions to me, except that they have pleased me quite as much in print as in M.S.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> You must have worked very hard; the labour must have been extreme, but I do hope that you will have health and strength to go on. You would laugh, if you could have seen how indignant all Owen’s lies and mean conduct about E. Columbi made me.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I did not get to sleep till past 3 o’clock. How well you lash him; firmly and severely with unruffled temper, as if you were performing a simple duty.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> The case is come to such a pass, that I think every man of science is bound to show his feelings by some overt act, and I shall watch for a fitting opportunity.</p>
<p>Ever my dear Falconer | Yours most truly | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I have kept back for a day the enclosed owing to the arrival of your most interesting letter.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I knew it was a mere chance whether you could inform on points required; but no one other person has so often responded to my miscellaneous queries.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I believe I have now in my greenhouse L. trigynum, which came up from seed purchased as L. flavum, from which it is wholly different in foliage.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have just sent in paper on Dimorphism of Linum to the Linn. Soc.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> and so I do not doubt your memory is right about L. trigynum:<ref target="#foot.f14"/> the functional difference in the two forms of Linum is really wonderful. I assure you I quite long to see you and a few others in London: it is not so much the eczema which has taken off the epidermis a dozen times clean off; but I have been knocked up of late with extraordinary facility and when I shall be able to come up I know not.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I particularly wish to hear about the wondrous Bird;<ref target="#foot.f16"/> the case has delighted me, because no group is so isolated as Birds. I much wish to hear when we meet which digits are developed; when examining birds two or three years ago, I distinctly remember writing to Lyell that some day a fossil bird would be found with end of wing cloven, i.e. the bastard wing and other part both well developed.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> Thanks for Von Martius returned by this post, which I was glad to see.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> Poor old Wagner always attacked me in a proper spirit and sent me two or three little brochures, and I thanked him cordially.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> The Germans seem much stirred up on the subject. I received by the same post almost a little volume on the <hi rend="underline">Origin</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>I cannot work above a couple of hours daily and this plays the deuce with me.</p>
<p>Farewell my good old friend | C. D.</p>
<p>I put in another query, on <hi rend="underline">remotest</hi> possibility of information; if I do <hi rend="underline">not</hi> hear I shall understand you have none.<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>P.S. 2nd. I have worked like a slave and been baffled like a slave in trying to make out the meaning of two very different sets of stamens in some Melastomaceae.<ref target="#foot.f22"/> I must tell you one fact. I counted 9000 seeds, one by one, from my artificially fertilised pods. There is something very odd but I am as yet beaten. Plants from two pollens grow at different rates!<ref target="#foot.f23"/> Now what I want to know is, whether in individuals of the <hi rend="underline">same species</hi>, growing together, you have ever noticed any difference in the position of the pistil or in the size and colour of the stamens?</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD refers to the footnote (Falconer 1863a, p. 100 n.) in which Falconer stated that in 1857, he had called attention to the ‘exceptional character’ of certain specimens of <hi rend="italic">Mastodon andinum</hi>, which appeared to be ‘hesitating’ between the two subgenera <hi rend="italic">Tetralophodon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trilophodon</hi>, which were distinguished by the number of ridges on the molar crowns (Falconer 1857a, p. 313).</note>

Falconer argued that because of the lack of direct testimony as to its discovery, the specimen did not constitute evidence of an Australian species. He asked, if the fossil was indeed Australian, how ‘the <hi rend="italic">Mastodon</hi> alone, of all the higher placental mammals’, had overcome ‘the barriers of marsupial isolation, characteristic of the great southern island’ (Falconer 1863a, p. 101). Falconer maintained that Owen’s <hi rend="italic">M. australis</hi> was a specimen of <hi rend="italic">M. andinum</hi>, a South American species (Falconer 1863a, pp. 96–101).

While disputing the adequacy of natural selection to account for the origin of species, Falconer at the same time stated that CD, ‘beyond all his contemporaries’, had inspired ‘the philosophical investigation of the most backward and obscure branch of the Biological Sciences of his day’, and had laid ‘the foundations of a great edifice’ (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 80). Falconer sent CD a manuscript portion of his paper on American fossil elephants in September 1862 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3737.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Hugh Falconer, 24–7 September [1862]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3746.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Hugh Falconer, 1 October [1862]</ref>, and this volume, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3899.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Hugh Falconer, 3 January [1863]</ref>).</note>
