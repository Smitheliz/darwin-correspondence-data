                    <p>Thanks to Parker’s dilatoriness the Picture had not been forwarded<ref target="#foot.f1"/>   I sent off to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Myers<ref target="#foot.f2"/> with the corrected address, and also called this morning upon M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. P: I trust, the Portrait will arrive safely, it goes from me uninjured, &amp; the more I examine it, I think that it will adorn either your own or your relations dining-room—</p>
<p>If it could speak, it would tell of its own travels and interesting history, 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. at Ashborne, then over the chimney piece at Derby in Uncle Hadley’s dining-room afterwards in several migrations to residences with my esteemed &amp; loved Aunt Hadley &amp; more strange still to myself, and last to those who will value it for its ancestral worth—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Glad as I am to see it so safely housed, I feel a little pang when I say farewell to the dear old painting— I received y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. handsome acknowledgment for it, but never was such a thing heard of as payment before the article received it is most kind &amp; benevolent of you.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I shall be glad to hear that Parker has duly attended to all directions—</p>
                    <p>At your leisure I shall be glad to learn your opinion of the painting. Wrights are I believe considered valuable, tho’ in his life-time he did not receive the commendation he ought to have done.</p>
<p>I send you another copy of my friend’s; I have another so pray accept it—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Receive my best wishes for the New-Year &amp; I hope that you may be spared many more to look on your justly famed ancestor— | I am dear Sir, | Yours truly, &amp; obliged, | Eliz<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. A. Greaves</p>
<p>P.S. Parker’s men have just been for the Picture; and it will be sent off tomorrow morning, so that I trust you will receive it in the Eveng. in the same condition it went from here: I laid down very strict injunctions—&amp; they will be answerable for any damage—</p>
