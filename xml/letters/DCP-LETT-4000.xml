<p>I received a few days ago your Book &amp; this morning your pamphlet on Man &amp; your kind letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am heartily sorry that your head is not yet strong, &amp; whatever you do, do not again overwork yourself.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Your book is a monument of labour, though I have as yet only just turned over the pages.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> It evidently contains a mass of valuable matter.—</p>
<p>With respect to the change of species I fully admit your objections are perfectly valid.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have noticed them<ref target="#foot.f6"/>, excepting one of separation of countries, on which perhaps we differ a <hi rend="underline">little</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I admit, that if we really now know the beginning of life on this planet, it is absolutely fatal to my views; I admit the same, if the geological record is not <hi rend="underline">excessively</hi> imperfect; &amp; I further admit that the a priori probability is that no being lived below our Cambrian era. Nevertheless I grow yearly more convinced of the general (with much incidental error) truth of my views: I believe in this from finding that my views embrace so many phenomena &amp; explain them to a large extent. I am continually pleased by hearing of naturalists (within the last month I have heard of four) who have come round to a large extent to the belief of the modification—of Species.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> As my book has been lately somewhat attended to, perhaps it would have been better, if when you condemn all such views, you had stated that you had not been able yet to read it.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> But pray do not suppose that I think for one instant that with your strong &amp; slowly-acquired convictions, &amp; immense knowledge, you would have been converted. The utmost that I could have hoped would have been that you might possibly have been here or there staggered. Indeed I should not much value any sudden conversion; for I remember well how many long years I fought against my present belief.—</p>
<p>With respect to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Falconer, I fear I ought not to have said anything, as he lately told me that he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not interfere till Prof. Owen had published; so please do not repeat what I said.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I daresay Owen will work out everything carefully before he publishes in detail; but there is little doubt he was at <hi rend="underline">first</hi> very careless. He overlooked a jaw with teeth which however may possibly not have belonged to this marvellous Bird, with its long tail &amp; fingers to its wings.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> As Birds are so isolated this case, as you may suppose, has pleased me.— You will see in Lyell’s book that Owen has made a fearful mistake (not discovered by himself) about the British Eocene monkey.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> He has made such mistakes about the Elephants &amp; Rhinoceroses, that I declare I am getting fearful of trusting him.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> He has done the work of a giant; but I fear he has been too ambitious &amp; not given time enough to most of his work.— I have not yet read Huxley’s book;<ref target="#foot.f14"/> but I hear it is very striking; but you will highly disapprove of it.—</p>
<p>With every good wish | pray believe me | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>I do not believe D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Falconer has changed his views about the Mesozoic mammals; but he has done more; for the specimens were presented to British Museum &amp; are kept by Owen in his private room; &amp; why he does not publish I cannot conceive.— In the last, or last but one, no<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> of the Geolog. Journal there is paper by Falconer on Plagiaulax, maintaining strenuously his former views.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>

It has brought to light no facts sustaining a theory that derives species from others, either by a system of evolution, or by a system of variations of living individuals, and bears strongly against both hypotheses. </quote></note>
