                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>It is very long since I wrote you, so long ago, that I find I am growing old (70) but thankful to say, except hearing, active, healthy &amp; strong &amp; am always busy about natural history &amp; Geology, &amp; have been lucky, in making good hits in both.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> However, I have read your last work on the Descent of man, &amp; your two former ones.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> My son &amp; self possess them—we have them of our own, so that we may take our time &amp; ‘read, mark &amp; learn, &amp; inwardly digest,’ &amp; I am happy to say it does not hinder our digestion or make us unhappy.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> We take to it kindly &amp; consequently get ourselves—at times—snubbed &amp; even take this kindly. I find people are constantly talking ‘Dawinism’ (excuse the last word) and do not know it, &amp; when I catch them at it, I quietly help them on &amp; do not let them know that I am doing so.</p>
<p>With the ‘unco guid” I’ve another way—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I quietly ask them whether “they expect when they die, to be, far higher &amp; more glorious &amp;c. in the next world.” “Yes of course” they say— “Well then was it more difficult for God to bring us from a lower form, than it is to make us a higher when we have done with this world.” They try to shuffle, but I pin them to it &amp; you would smile to see how puzzled they are. The intent of this letter is first to ask how you are &amp; beg you to accept of my best regards for ‘Auld lang syne’.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Next, I send with this a small box by “Pattern post”<ref target="#foot.f6"/> In which I have put a piece of Gulfweed part of a mass sent me by the Capt<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. of a vessel, now lying at W. Hartlepool, he got it in 32<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. N &amp; 77<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> West on the 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. March last, I got it last Monday.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Although Gulfweed was plentiful, this was in a small patch &amp; looked so beautiful he got some of it &amp; kindly sent me a piece. I have never seen any like it—at first I thought it <hi rend="underline">Oxynaspis</hi>—but give that up, I’ve tried <hi rend="underline">Lepas pectinata</hi> but do not get on well—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I cannot make it that—for if I remember right in the hundreds collected by me in Cornwall &amp; Shetland they differ, &amp; therefore in my dilemma I have sent you a piece of the weed &amp; ask you to be good enough to decide. I should also be glad to know whether the other is <hi rend="underline">L. anserifera</hi> <hi rend="italic">[</hi>Linn.<hi rend="italic">]</hi><ref target="#foot.f9"/> They have done me the honor of making me one of the Presidents of the Royal Physical Society here &amp; I want <hi rend="underline">to be sure</hi>, if they print my little story about it.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I shall also be glad to know whether it is a common one.</p>
<p>I enclose a rough sketch to show that at A. B. C. in many, there are thin films, in which rounded shining spots are seen &amp; it is these that puzzle me—for as they get (the cirripede) longer the one at A is lost—the other two continue longest, but B the longest of all. Probably there is nothing in this. The smallest ones show these pretty things <hi rend="underline">best.</hi><ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>

<p>P.S. to Letter 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. May 1871.</p>
<p>I do not know whether the following will be interesting to you. I jotted them down when I thought about them as “to tell M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin.”— This is in connexion with Chap IV p. 147—Vol I Descent of Man   “My Wife has often noticed that children nursed by Woemen who had milk in one breast only, that their children <hi rend="underline">invarably</hi> had one side of the head much larger than the other.”<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>When I lived at Beer Devonshire, there was a L<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. in the Navy whose Wife—a very fine woman—was “stone deaf”—she was not so when he married her—<hi rend="underline">but became so after having her first child</hi> &amp; ever continued so—she had several children after—all could hear but strange to say, her eldest daughter became so (stone deaf) after <hi rend="underline">her first child</hi> &amp; ever remained so.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> What is still more singular the Sister of the first mentioned, who also married a L<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. RN was similary afflicted under the same circumstance. I knew the two first well. I regret that I did not at the time enquire whether the mother of the two Sisters was so before them. Their father was a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Raymond, Manager or Proprietor of one of the London Theatres.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>When at Goran Haven in Cornwall one of our servant Girls, was married to a Sailor, a young &amp; very healthy, handsome Girl, she had three children before she was 21, &amp; died after giving birth to her third a few days, with violent purging &amp; throwing up—her mother died about the same age. &amp; on her third child with the same kind of sickness &amp; purging.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Black Cocks</hi>.— I’ve often seen the male ones* at daylight in the morning sitting on the walls of the fields sunning themselves in great numbers, &amp; not a hen near,—this near Berriedale in Caithness. This when travelling per Mail from Wick when visiting the outposts &amp; creeks officially.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>My old dog “Hassan”—I had him 15 years—invariably howled at B flat when blown on the flute—&amp; quite in time— no other note disturbed him, this he responded to immediately— I’ve tried it very often &amp; always successfully.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Grouse &amp; Bagpipe</hi>. I was once travelling from Lairg to <hi rend="underline">Inch-na damph</hi> in Sutherlandshire on the mail cart—a piper was a passenger (he was the Duchess of Sutherlands)<ref target="#foot.f18"/>   the driver &amp; all of us persuaded him to give us “a spring” &amp; he did play well &amp; I was able to <hi rend="underline">almost</hi> enjoy the <hi rend="underline">noise</hi>, for the first &amp; last time only.— We were amongst the heather hills, &amp; when the pipes were at their best, I observed a Cock Grouse show his head above the heather, within 10 yards of the cart, &amp; slowly glide up a small hill there, with his head at full stretch listening as if entranced by the sound, &amp; kept getting up higher &amp; higher so that he could see us until we were out of sight of him.— He was so intent on the music I almost fancy he might have been picked up.</p>
<p>I must not indulge in more, all these I can vouch for from personal knowledge.</p>
