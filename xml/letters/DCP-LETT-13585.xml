<p>Judging from what you say there appears to be no red colouring matter present in the plant that could be turned blue by the neutralization of free acid.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I therefore suspect that the change is analogous to one that often occurs in more or less alkaline solutions. In most cases that I examined I was of opinion that the production of the colouring matter was due to the oxidization by the air of one or other of the different kinds of tannic acid but I am quite prepared to believe that other substances have the same sort of property and feel almost certain that this is so in the case of many lichens.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> On the whole I venture to suggest that the plant contains something changed into the colouring matter when in a slightly alkaline solution. If you could send me a little of the fresh plant I could make it out more certainly</p>
<p>I left off studying the colouring matters of plants in order to work up all the material I had collected for my two addresses at the Geological Society on the structure of rocks and since then have been led into a whole lot of new work by living on my yacht nearly half the year.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The first few years I was learning what to do. The last I have done a fair lot of scientific work. Along with Prof. Herdman my first paper will soon appear on a number of new British Ascidians.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have splendid opportunities for collecting and observing and in a while hope to do good service to science in this department. I should do more if my attention were not so much directed to a sort of compound of art and science—art illustrating science and science helping art—which however is I hope useful in another department of knowledge. If I can in any way assist you in connexion with marine work in the English Channel &amp;c I shall be very pleased and if you could suggest anything that it would be desirable to examine I should be very much obliged. I am attending to nearly all departments of scientific work along with the best authorities in each branch.</p>
<p>Trusting that you are well and being always most glad to do any little thing I can to advance the great questions you have so constantly in hand; wishing you a happy new year | I remain | Yours very truly | H C. Sorby</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD’s letter to Sorby has not been found. The plant pigments associated with red are anthocyanins; their colour changes from red to blue in less acidic (neutral) solutions. </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Anthocyanins in water typically lose colour, but tannic acid acts as a co-pigment with anthocyanins, stabilising colour. Lichens are symbiotic associations of fungi and algae; the anthocyanin in lichens is derived from the algal component, as there is no anthocyanin in fungi.</note>
