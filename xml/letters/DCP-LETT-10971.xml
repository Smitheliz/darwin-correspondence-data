<p>Pray thank M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Grant Allen for his kindness in having sent me his Work. The subject is a very difficult &amp; interesting one, &amp; I shall be very glad to read the passages which you have so kindly marked, &amp; indeed, if I can find time, other parts.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But good Heavens what a lot of books there is to read.—</p>
<p>I have heard nothing about the “rub” at the R. Soc; &amp; I wish you had told me more. I suppose it refers to “spontaneous Generation” &amp; I shall be glad of anything which helps to settle that question for the present. Huxley recently told me that he thought Tyndall’s recent work about old germs withstanding long-continued boiling was most important &amp; apparently decisive.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The Council have refused to print Frank’s paper on the Teazle glands—on what grounds I know not. I have not been so much mortified for many a year; but he does not care much, all such things being mere trifles to him. My opinion about the value of his work remains quite unchanged &amp; I care not who the referees may have been. But it is foolish in me to speak thus.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I wish that any of my sons could have attended your lecture, but it is not possible.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> When I last saw you I remember I wished you all good luck with your grafting experiment, &amp; ill-luck with spiritualism; &amp; in one sense my wishes seem to have come true, though in another sense your negative results are highly pleasing,—delightful to me, for I felt convinced that Williams was a very clever rogue.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Many thanks for your pleasant letter | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
