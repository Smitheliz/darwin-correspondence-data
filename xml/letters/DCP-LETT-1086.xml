                <div type="transcription">
<p>You have made a savage onslaught,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; I must try to defend myself. But first let me say that I never write to you except for my own good pleasure; now I fear that you answer me when busy &amp; without inclination (&amp; I am sure I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have none, if I was as busy as you): pray do not do so, as if I thought my writing entailed an answer from you nolens volens, it would destroy all my pleasure in writing.—</p>
<p>Firstly: I did not consider my letter as <hi rend="underline">reasoning</hi>, or even as <hi rend="underline">speculation</hi>, but simply as mental rioting &amp; as I was sending Binney’s paper I poured out to you the result of reading it.—</p>
<p>Secondly, you are right indeed in thinking me mad, if you suppose that I would class any ferns as marine plants:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but surely there is a wide distinction between the plants found upright in the coal beds &amp; those not upright &amp; which might have been drifted. Is it not probable that the same circumstances which have preserved the vegetation <hi rend="underline">in situ</hi>, sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have preserved drifted plants? I know calamites is found upright, but I fancied its affinities were very obscure like Sigillaria. As for Lepidodendron I forgot its existence, as happens when one goes riot &amp; now know neither what it is, or whether upright. If these plants, ie calamites &amp; Lepidodendron have <hi rend="underline">very clear relations</hi> to terrestrial vegetables,, like the ferns have, &amp; are found upright in situ, of course I must give up the ghost. But surely Sigilliria is the main upright plant, &amp; on its obscure affinities I have heard you enlarge.—</p>
<p>Thirdly, it never entered my head to under=value botanical relatively to zoological evidence; except in so far as I thought it was admitted that the vegetative structure seldom yielded any evidence of affinity, nearer than that of families, &amp; not always so much: &amp; is it not in plants, as certainly it is in animals, dangerous to judge of habits without very near affinity. Could a Botanist tell from structure alone that the mangrove family, almost or quite alone in dicots:, could live in the sea—&amp; the zostera family almost alone amongst the monocot<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>:? Is it a safe argument, that because algæ are almost the only, or the only, submerged sea-plants, that formerly other groups had not members with such habits; with animals such an argument would not be conclusive, as I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. illustrate by many examples;—but I am forgetting myself, I want only to some degree to defend myself, &amp; not burn my fingers by attacking you.— The foundation of my letter, &amp; what is my deliberate opinion, though I daresay you will think it absurd, is that I would rather trust, cæteris paribus, pure geological evidence than either Zoolog. or Botan. evidence: I do not say that I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> sooner trust <hi rend="underline">poor</hi> geolog. evidence than <hi rend="underline">good</hi> organic: I think the bases of pure geological reasoning is simpler, (consisting chiefly of the action of water on the crust of the earth, &amp; its up &amp; down movements) than bases drawn from the difficult subject of affinities &amp; of structure in relation to habits.</p>
<p>I can hardly analyse the facts on which I have come to this conclusion; but I can illustrate it: Pallas’ account<ref target="#foot.f3"/> would lead anyone to suppose that the Siberian strata with the frozen carcasses had been quietly deposited &amp; hence that the embedded animals had lived in the neighbourhood: but our zoological knowledge of 30 years ago, led everyone falsely to reject this conclusion.</p>
<p>Tell me that an upright fern <hi rend="underline">in situ</hi> occurs with Sigilliria &amp; Stigmaria, or that the affinities of Calamites &amp; Lepidodendron (supposing that they are found in situ with Sigilliria) as so <hi rend="underline">clear</hi> that they could not have been marine, like, but in a greater degree, than the mangrove &amp; sea-wrack, &amp; I will humbly apologise to you &amp; all Botanists, for having let my mind run riot on a subject on which assuredly I know nothing. But till I hear this, I shall keep privately to my own opinion, with the same pertinacity &amp; as you will think with the same philosophical spirit, with which Kœnig<ref target="#foot.f4"/> maintains that Cheirotherium-footsteps are fuci.</p>
<p>Whether this letter will sink me still lower in your opinion, or put me a little right, I know not, but hope the latter. Anyhow I have revenged myself with boring you with a very long epistle.</p>
<p>Farewell &amp; be forgiving— Ever yours C. Darwin</p>
<p>When will you return to Kew? I have forgotten one main object of my letter, to thank you <hi rend="underline">much</hi> for your offer of the Hort. Journal, but I have ordered the two numbers with Herbert,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> whose writing I always like.—</p>
