<p>How long it is since we have had any communication &amp; I really want to hear how the world goes with you; but my immediate object is to ask you to observe a point for me, &amp; as I know how you are a very busy man with too much to do, I shall have a good chance of your doing what I want, as it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be hopeless to ask a quite idle man.—</p>
<p>As you have a noah’s ark,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I do not doubt that you have pigeons; (how I wish by any chance they were fantails!) Now what I want to know is, at what age nestling pigeons have their tail feathers sufficiently developed to be counted. I do not think I ever even saw a young pigeon. I am hard at work on my notes, collating &amp; comparing them, in order in some 2 or 3 years to write a book with all the facts &amp; arguments, which I can collect, <hi rend="underline">for &amp; versus</hi> the immutability of species.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I want to get the young of our domestic breeds to see how young, &amp; to what degree, the differences appear. I must either breed myself (which is no amusement, but a horrid bore to me) the pigeons or buy them young, &amp; before I go to a seller whom I have heard of from Yarrell,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am really anxious to know something about their development not to expose my excessive ignorance, &amp; therefore be excessively liable to be cheated &amp; gulled— With respect to the <hi rend="underline">one</hi> point of the tail feathers, it is, of course, in relation to the wonderful development of tail feathers in the adult fan-tail.</p>
<p>If you had any breed of Poultry pure, I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. beg a chicken with exact age stated about a week or fortnight old! to be sent in Box by Post, if c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have the heart to kill one, &amp; secondly w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. let me pay postage. Indeed I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be very glad to have a nestling common pigeon sent, for I mean to make skeletons, &amp; have already just begun comparing wild &amp; tame ducks,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; I think the results rather curious, for on weighing the several bones very carefully, when perfectly cleaned, the <hi rend="underline">proportional</hi> weights of the two have greatly varied; the foot of the tame having largely increased. How I wish I could get a little wild duck of a week old, but that I know is almost impossible.—</p>
<p>With respect to ourselves, I have not much to say: we have just now a terribly noisy house with the Hooping cough:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> but otherwise are all well. Far the greatest fact, about myself is that I have at last quite done with the everlasting Barnacles. At the end of the year we had two of our little Boys very ill with fever &amp; Bronchites &amp; all sorts of ailments.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Partly for amusement &amp; partly for change of air we went to London &amp; took a House for a month, but it turned out a great failure, for that dreadful frost just set in when we went, &amp; all our children got unwell &amp; Emma &amp; I had cougsh, &amp; colds, &amp; rheumatism nearly all the time.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> We had put down first on our list (of things to do) to go &amp; see M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Fox, but literally, after waiting some time to see whether the weather would not improve, we had not a day when we both could go out.</p>
<p>I do hope before very long you will be able to manage to pay us a visit: Time is slipping away, &amp; we are getting oldish. Do tell us about yourself &amp; all your large family.</p>
<p>I know you will help me, <hi rend="underline">if you can</hi>, with information about the young pigeons: &amp; anyhow do write before very long.</p>
<p>My dear Fox | Your sincere old friend | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Amongst all sorts of odds &amp; ends, with which I am amusing myself, I am comparing the seeds of the vars. of plants. I had formerly some wild cabbage seeds, which I gave to some one. Was it to you? It is a <hi rend="underline">thousand</hi> to one that it is thrown away, if not I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very glad of a pinch of it.—</p>
