                    <p>I was away on Friday Saturday, Sunday, Monday &amp; on Tuesday I found the bason in which cleaned leaf was dried up having stupidly forgotten to tell them to give water. The leaf seemed all right &amp; green except that there was a longish brown mark on one leaflet as if it was decayed, the uncleaned leaf seemed all right.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I could start the thing again if you thought it worth while &amp; will tell me as to cleaning.</p>
<p>When I got back on Monday I found poor Brindle had been taken ill moping on Saturday, &amp; was very bad on Sunday foaming at the mouth &amp; snapping and seemed almost dead by the evening, &amp; on Monday morning Dick killed him— it sounds very like hydrophobia, &amp; I see there have been mad dogs about. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. C.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> says he snapped at Jet who was fastened to him on Sunday morning. So I have chained Jet up in dog kennel in back yard with a notice that no one should touch him. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. C is anxious not to kill him straight off, so I shall wait &amp; see if he mopes too much, as he is very miserable now. the back yard is more cheerful than the kennel &amp; he is easier watched, &amp; I think a strong chain is precaution enough with sheep hurdles to keep Dick away—</p>
<p>Your affect son | W. E. D</p>
<p>Dick does not think it was madness, but something to do with distemper his nose &amp; face swelled up again as before</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is established from the reference to Jet the dog’s possible infection with hydrophobia. In a <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Emma Darwin of [24 July 1877]</ref> (DAR 210.5: 15, dated by a postmark), William wrote that he had killed Jet with prussic acid on the advice of a friend who thought that Jet certainly had hydrophobia. CD and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin</ref> stayed with William until Wednesday 4 July 1877 (CD’s ‘Journal’ (Appendix II)). There were three Thursdays between 4 and 24 July, but given William’s own recent absence, this letter could not have been written on the first Thursday, which leaves 12 and 19 July.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">William was probably helping CD with experiments to see whether bloom on leaves protected them from water damage (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10960.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Fritz Müller, 14 May 1877</ref> and n. 2).</note>

Dick was William’s manservant (<ref target="" resp="#automat">letter from Emma Darwin to Leonard Darwin, 12 November [1876]</ref> (DAR 239.23: 1.52)). He has not been further identified.</note>
