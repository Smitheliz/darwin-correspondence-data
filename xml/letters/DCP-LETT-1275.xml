        <abstract> 
<p>Discusses J. D. Dana’s <hi rend="italic">Geology</hi> [1849]. Pleased that the part on corals confirms his views [<hi rend="italic">Coral reefs</hi> (1842)]. Discusses Dana’s observation that in Sandwich Islands lava streams often join dikes at right angles with no cone. Retracts earlier denial of this possibility. Criticises Dana’s view of Australian valleys.</p>

<p>This letter requires no answer, &amp; I write solely from exuberance of vanity. Dana has sent me the Geolog. of U.S. Expedition &amp; I have just read the Coral Part.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> To begin with a modest speech, <hi rend="underline">I am astonished at my own accuracy</hi>!! if I were to rewrite now my coral book, there is hardly a sentence I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have to alter—except that I ought to have attributed more effect to recent volcanic action in checking growth of coral.— When I say all this, I ought to add, that the <hi rend="underline">consequences</hi> of the theory on areas of subsidence are treated in a separate chapter to which I have not come, &amp; in this I suspect we shall differ more.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Dana talks of agreeing with my theory <hi rend="underline">in most points</hi>; I can find out not one in which he differs.— Considering how infinitely more he saw of Coral Reefs than I did, this is wonderfully satisfactory to me; though really I think it some little reflection on him, that he did find other &amp; new points to observe. He treats me most courteously.— There now my vanity is pretty well satisfied.</p>
<p>I am now reading the volcanic part, which is <hi rend="underline">excellent</hi> &amp; much very original: I do not know whether you have seen it, but I think you ought.— I remember in my last letter talking very big about dikes never being connected directly (ie rectangularly) with lava-streams; but it is clear that such occur frequently at the Sandwich Is<hi rend="superscript">ds</hi>. without any cones.— I think, however, that there can be no doubt that this is a rare exceptional case; I do not quite perceive why in some cases there are cones with scoriæ, &amp; in other cases not. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. suppose Etna could not come into same predicament with the Sandwich Vents, for if I understood you, there were beds of scoriæ between the streams of lava.— But perhaps you have read Dana &amp; all I write is superfluous—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. of course lend you my copy,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> if you have not one of your own—though I believe there is one in Geolog. Soc.— Dana discusses the great Australian valleys; &amp; thinks they have been formed by running fresh water; his arguments are very ingenious, but I am not <hi rend="underline">at all</hi> converted by them; indeed I doubt whether he saw the more striking cases: he allows the valleys are valleys of denudation.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I looked with some trepidation to Craters of Elevation in index, but there was nothing (as far as I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> see in casual glance) which concerned you.—</p>
<p>I am bound to state that now that I have read Dana, I believe there are cases at Galapagos, of streams proceeding from dikes without cones, which I saw at a <hi rend="underline">distance</hi>, near summit of <hi rend="underline">great</hi> craters but did not ascend to.— I remember being surprised at not seeing a cone, but slurred the difficulty over: the great craters at Galapagos, as I have remarked in Book,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> are singular from having evolved so little scoriæ.</p>
<p>I shall be up on 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Farewell— My boasting has done me a deal of good | Your’s Ever | C. Darwin</p>
