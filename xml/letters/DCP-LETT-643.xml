<p>Thank God for the good news your letter brings—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I send the phaeton for Mrs Bennett who is with Mrs Stone at Newcastle, and I am therefore half afraid she may not be able to set out tonight— the phaeton will wait and bring her to the train if she can—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>My poor dear Emma what sad news to meet her after her labour. I continue to hope however— my father still takes food often, and his pulse varies only between 80 and 90, and does not seem to me very weak— but his voice is very indistinct and his wandering now incessant. He asked for Charles just now, and said it was not Charles Langton How could such words as your’s dear Charles pain me? oh if such a man could be still spared us!</p>
<p>Mr Garner<ref target="#foot.f4"/> yesterday seemed to think him quite as well as he expected. He has not yet been today.</p>
<p>I do hope Catharine will be able to go.</p>
<p>I am very glad it is a little girl, though I dont know now whether Emma cares—</p>
<p>My best of loves to my dear Emma—&amp; goodbye—</p>
