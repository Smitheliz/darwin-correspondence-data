<p>The white muscat grape has again changed to dark purple this year; but there is one difference from last year; then all were of full size and all coloured.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> This year at least one third of each branch have remained small, not much larger than currants—and the colour has not touched them; while all that have grown to full size are fast becoming purple as they approach to ripening. I cannot understand why a portion should apparently be left very small because they were not to be coloured.</p>
<p>We made the acquaintance this summer at Buxton of your cousins at “Fern”, and of their son Cap<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. D who was so long at home through smashing his knee cap on the Flagship at Malta. It was a sad thing for him when in the best position for promotion; before we left he went out to join “Cruiser” at Malta; and though still on two sticks he was quite well enough for Commanding a small vessel.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> So much less work than Commander of a large ship, doing all the work of a 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Lieut.</p>
<p>My daughter’s lameness was much better for Buxton. My wife walks no better, but the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. did not hold out much hopes of its removing her stiffness.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He would not let me try the waters, and unfortunately I got a cough there for three weeks which tried my shaky head much, and which had not quite left me till lately. We returned home a month since after a month at Newcastle and in E Yorkshire after leaving Buxton.</p>
<p>I had promised my wife’s sister at Brighton to go there about this time, where I should have seen Mellersh who lives near them.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> and I had planned going over for a day by train to see you as I did from Lewes; but I am not well enough to leave now, as I feel a little of the old weakness in right arm and leg, through my head not having been well. and I have been ordered to avoid all exerting work at present such as taking part in meetings &amp;c.</p>
                    <p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Langton is pretty well, but I think he has looked weaker and older since last winter.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I heard from Usborne last week.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> he is still busy with his small steam Boat Company, going to launch his last new boat this week; and he says that as he has now brought his Company to paying a large dividend, and cannot improve any more on the boats, he is going to give up being manager; as he finds he must do less work. He says he is 72   I thought he was my age. The Beagle seems to have promoted Longevity; for out of our small number it is wonderfull that eight are still alive—above 70—and what is still more strange that out of at least 30 officers in Ships in each Commission 1823–6—1826–9—only three myself—Usborne—&amp; Hamond<ref target="#foot.f7"/>—being in both Commissions—there are only 5 of us alive of the first Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. and 4 of the second " 3 of each being Beagle’s also; yet several of our party went through different wars—&amp; Usborne with a ball through his body more than 40 years since.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> It is indeed a cause for much thankfulness when one looks back on it all.</p>
<p>I told Hooker about the grapes: he thought it a very curious case; so I have just sent him a few of both large and small.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>With our kind regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. D and all your party Believe me | yours most sincerely | B. J. Sulivan</p>
