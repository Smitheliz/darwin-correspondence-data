                    <p>Before answering your long letter, there are a few miscellaneous points to touch on.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You audacious dog I have answered about Printing machine without the aid of red-pencil &amp;c.— I rather hope you will feel inclined to give it to Semper.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>I have got branch of Porliera with Quick-lime, &amp; fancy it has produced very slight effect. Your rain-case with Porliera is capital: when leaflets are asleep about <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>3</mn></mfrac></math></formula> of under surface is protected or covered by next leaflet behind, &amp; I imagined that perhaps there w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be very few or no stomata in the <hi rend="underline">unprotected</hi> part.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>In the proceeding of K. Akad. d. Wissenschaften in Wien. In No XVI just received there is long abstract of great Paper or book by Wiesner on Heliotropism &amp; Geotropism: it seems very important, but I cannot understand it; do get it at Wurzburg &amp; read it; my puzzle is at p. 139, what on earth he means by “Induction”.— Perhaps Sachs will have read it— After you have read it; if you do not understand talk to him about “Induction”.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>I have nearly finished with Thalia— it is a wonderful case, but not worth the time which I have spent on it; as I now find through Dyer that Delpino has described an allied genus, but seems to have entirely missed the interesting point of sensitiveness.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>I partially agree with what Sachs says about the distinction between the circumnutation of free twiners, &amp; the subsequent growth on one side after they have twined round a support; that the growth then is almost exclusively on one side alone is, I think, shown by their clasping the stems very closely; but they slide a little up the support in their coiled state which seems to show that there must be a little growth on all sides.— Nor can I see why the part beyond point of contact sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> at once stop circumnutating. This seems well worth investigating.— There is nothing about this, I believe, in my book, except the fact of sliding up, &amp; I had not thought of it in relation to our general view of modified circumnutation.— At p. 131 of 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Edit there is the passage about circumnutation of tendrils stopping when apogeotropism comes into action; but you must remember that I there speak only of <hi rend="underline">conspicuous</hi> circumnutation.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Lately I have observed several plants; laid on one side for apogeotropism to act carefully by tracing, &amp; the line is sometimes quite straight, but more commonly slightly zig-zag, showing a vestige of circumnutation, just as with Heliotropism.</p>
                    <p>At—p. 129 of Climbing book there is fine case of modified circumnutation in order for tendril to pass over terminal shoot.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
                    <p>I never tried turning a twined plant upside down; so your fact new to me.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
                    <p>I told De Vries the case about tips of tendrils (p. 132) was well worth investigating in relation to growth, &amp; he seemed to agree.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
                    <p>The contraction of tendril into spire, which is so important for the plant, seems another case of modified circumnutation or rather, I suppose, of growth prolonged on one side alone after it has ceased on all other sides.— I cannot believe that a tendril curling when touched in less than 1m. is due to growth; &amp; De Vries seemed in a letter to me staggered by my arguments.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
                    <p>You must remember when I wrote the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Edit. of Climbers, I knew very little about growth or cause of circumnutation. I do not know whether I have answered what you want to know, &amp; whether this note will be intelligible. You have given me fine list of Sleepers.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
                    <p>It is very odd about wet &amp; dry culms of grass &amp; sticks: does Sachs understand it.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
                    <p>Something made me think the other day that aggregation in roots from C. of Ammonia, w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be in your line &amp; w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be fine subject: a little wild Euphorbia showed it plainest, &amp; a wonderful phenomenon it was.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I wonder no one has taken it up.</p>
                    <p>Bernard gets more &amp; more charming: he rebuked me sternly yesterday, because I said he was going in a booboo, whereas I ought to have said a gee-gee.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>

Wiesner called heliotropism (and gravitropism) induction phenomena because the response to a directional light source continued for a time even after the source was removed, in the absence of any counteracting force. The abstract stated that Wiesner had demonstrated that heliotropism was an induction phenomenon and that the effects induced were determinate and not additive (i.e. each stimulus resulted in a specific response).
