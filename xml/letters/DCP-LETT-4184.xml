<p>Various circumstances have delayed my thanks for your very interesting letter of Ap 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.—.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I thank you sincerely about the Melastomas:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> it seems that my suspicion was quite unfounded yet it is just possible that bees may visit the flowers for pollen &amp; suction.— I have wasted a fearful amount of time over this order.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> There is something very odd about the difference in the two sets of stamens   I first most strongly suspected that the plants on which I experimented were dimorphic; nor should I yet be surprised if this proved to be the case. I shall be very curious to know about the Catasetums &amp; what attracts insects.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> What a singular fact that of the orchids which did open their flowers setting seeds!<ref target="#foot.f6"/> A good observer M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Scott believes that when the flower is closed the pollen tubes come out of the anther &amp; travel to the stigma.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> You say you are going to try to make orchis seed germinate: D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker tells me that they cannot succeed in Calcutta;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> but that self-sown foreign plants appears on the surrounding trees!</p>
<p>I am very glad that you have not my Journal and I wrote a week ago to my publisher to send you a copy.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I sent sometime ago a newspaper to you in which I alluded to some of your information.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I have also sent a copy of a little paper on the dimorphism of Linum:<ref target="#foot.f11"/> This is a subject on which I am experimenting with <hi rend="underline">great</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">interest</hi>. Have you any analogous cases in the West Indies? You must kindly permit me to ask you questions: have you seen cases of what gardeners call “sports” but what I shall call “bud variation” (i.e. variation by buds &amp; not by seed) in plants from warmer temperate regions cultivated in the West Indies.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I am collecting <hi rend="underline">all</hi> cases. Sir R Schomburgk says that temperate plants as Dahlia, Roses &amp;c cultivated in St Domingo are very liable to change in character &amp; give off single shoots different from the mother plant.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>with cordial thanks for all your interesting information &amp; great kindness | Dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3943.xml" resp="#automat" cert="medium">letter to Crüger of 25 January [1863]</ref>, CD asked about the insects that visited the flowers of Melastomataceae. CD hypothesised that small flies or wasps were attracted by the fluid-filled horns of the anthers, which they penetrated with their probosces. Crüger assured him that the two species of bees seen visiting the flowers of <hi rend="italic">Heteronoma diversifolium</hi> came only for pollen; however, he agreed to make further observations of other species of Melastomataceae (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4124.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Hermann Crüger, 23 April 1863</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD refers to the order Melastomaceae (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4776.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Lindley 1853</ref>, p. 731), which corresponds approximately to the modern family Melastomataceae. CD had been working on the Melastomataceae since October 1861, suspecting that the family might exhibit a novel form of dimorphism (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3901.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Hugh Falconer, 5 [and 6] January [1863]</ref> and n. 22). CD’s experimental notes on Melastomataceae are in DAR 205.8.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4124.xml">letter to CD of 23 April 1863</ref>, Crüger wrote that he was going to investigate a secretion in the flower of the orchid <hi rend="italic">Catasetum tridentatum</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">C. macrocarpum</hi>, the jumping orchid) that appeared to attract bees.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4124.xml">letter to CD of 23 April 1863</ref>, Crüger wrote of an <hi rend="italic">Epidendrum</hi> species with flowers that usually did not open, though his specimen had ‘fully open’ flowers. Crüger reported: ‘These have not set fruit, while commonly I do not remember to have noticed a flower which was not followed by fruit.’</note>
