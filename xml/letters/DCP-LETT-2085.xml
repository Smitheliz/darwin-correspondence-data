<p>I have now been here for exactly one week, &amp; intend to stay one week more.— I had got very much below par at home, &amp; it is really quite astonishing &amp; utterly unaccountable the good this one week has done me.— I like D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lane &amp; his wife &amp; her mother, who are the proprietors of this establishment very much.— D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. L. is too young,—that is his only fault—but he is a gentleman &amp; very well read man.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> And in one respect I like him better than D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gully, viz that he does not believe in all the rubbish which D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. G. does; nor does he pretend to explain much, which neither he or any doctor can explain.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I enclose a paper for the strange chance of your ever knowing anyone in the S. in want of Hydropathy.— I really think I shall make a point of coming here for a fortnight occasionally, as the country is very pleasant for walking.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>But I, also, think it highly probable that we <hi rend="underline">all</hi> shall move to Malvern this summer, not for my sake, but for Etty’s, who has now been out of health for some six or 8 months. I hardly know yet when we shall go, if we do go; but I very much wish that we might meet you there. Etty is now &amp; has been for some time at Hastings.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I am well convinced that the only thing for Chronic cases is the water-cure.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Write to me either here or after Wednesday next to Down, &amp; tell me how the world goes on with you, &amp; how, especially, the Sciatica has been, if it was sciatica, which caused you so much suffering.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I believe that I worked too hard at home on my species-Book, which progresses, but very slowly. Whenever you write, as you are, I know, very learned in Pigs, pray tell me, whether any breed, known to have originated or to have been greatly modified, by a cross with the Chinese or Neapolitan Pig, whether any such crossed-breed, breeds true or nearly true.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I am pretty sure I have read of some breed known to have been formed by a cross with one of the above Breeds, but I cannot remember particulars.— I must now take a sitz Bath, my treatment being,—daily Shallow, Douche, &amp; Sitz.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

Smethurst had turned the house into a hydropathic establishment in or around 1850; by 1855, Lane had become the proprietor (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6375.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Post Office directory of the six home counties</hi></ref> 1851 and 1855). The patients at Moor Park were accommodated in the same building as Lane and his family. It was Lane’s belief that this arrangement was greatly beneficial to the patient (Lane 1857, p. 79).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Lane believed that a change of scenery was an essential constituent of therapy, the site of Moor Park having been chosen for its location in a ‘picturesque district abounding in pleasant and varied walks, with a dry soil under-foot and the fresh breezes of health playing about … over-head from morning till night’ (Lane 1857, p. 43).</note>
