<p>I have just closed your Volume on “Expression” with the deepest regret— regret, because I have arrived at the conclusion of another of your most valuable and interesting works. As I read page after page I occasionally jotted down confirmatory and additional footnotes. True these are but scanty and far between, but I trust that some of them, at least, may prove interesting to you as I can safely vouch for their accuracy. As it will save me a good deal of writing &amp; reference I send you the book and beg to refer your notice to the following pages:— 35— 46— 65— 67— 73— 98— 101— 113— 171— 173— 175— 214— 227— 230— 233— 233— 236— 238— 319— 345 and 364.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Two of these footnotes require a fuller explanation. At page 46 you give an admirable description of the manner in which young puppies and kittens keep “kneading” their mothers while in the act of sucking:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Now I think the following instances with regard to the human species are perfectly analogous cases:—</p>
<p>My second brother<ref target="#foot.f3"/>—with whom I often slept when a boy—used, in his sleep to invariably suck his tongue and at the same time to keep on kneading my legs with his toes, alternately using one foot and then the other. The <hi rend="underline">modus operandi</hi> consisted in first placing the sole of the foot flat against my leg then gradually raising the heel and at the same time doubling down the toes so as almost to pinch up the skin with them. This he would repeatedly do in his sleep for hours unless his legs were forcibly pushed away! The other case is that of a poor little crippled niece of mine who has suffered amputation of one of her legs, and who is now thirteen years old. This poor little afflicted girl often falls asleep on my knee, and as she does so one hand most assuredly finds its way to my neck, where she continues during sleep to knead with her fingers. She also sucks her tongue at the same time. Now it strikes me that both of these cases are greatly confirmatory of your theory.</p>
<p>I now pass on to another and quite distinct subject. At page 319 you quote an observation of Von Spix &amp; Martius on the theory of blushing—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Previous to reading that quotation I never knew that it had been penned, yet, strange to say, when I was in Newfoundland in 1867 I noted down an almost similar observation in my note-book.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It occurred under the following circumstance:— During that year eleven Micmac Indians arrived at the settlement where I was staying; these consisted of nine men and two young girls (sisters).<ref target="#foot.f6"/> One of the settlers invited all the Indians and the rest of the settlers to a dance at his house: I also joined the party as a looker-on, being then, as now, a cripple from frostbite.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> During the evening our host, who was not one of the most refined men that I have had the pleasure of meeting, made use of a most indelicate expression. Now I have no doubt that I blushed considerably myself, as I am very apt to do so, but I was then too much engrossed watching the countenances of the two Indian girls to notice my own confusion. One of the sisters—I believe the elder—immediately burst into a roaring fit of laughter, while the other as quickly cast down her eyes and blushed excessively; not even venturing to meet the gaze of any male person present, for some little time. Now I was informed by some of the Indian men that this modest girl could both <hi rend="underline">read and write</hi>, and was a most zealous Roman Catholic; while the other was a very ignorant girl; and much more masculine in her whole demeanour. Again, the Indian men asked me to accompany them on a six week’s tour, salmon spearing and beaver hunting, and their invitation was most earnestly supplemented by the brazen, ignorant girl, while her sister only cast down her eyes and spoke not a word until I appealed to her, calling her by her name. She again blushed very perceptibly and answered “<hi rend="underline">We</hi> will try and make you comfortable M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Reeks”! How could I possibly make any note otherwise than corroborative of that of Von Spix &amp; Martius? There is yet another kind of hereditary habit, which I consider greatly helps your theory, but it is one that you have almost ignored, viz, that of scratching. Scratching undoubtedly is a much earlier acquired habit than blushing. The latter evidently <hi rend="underline">advances</hi> with civilasation and good breeding, while the former as truly recedes before both. You, yourself, have noticed the constant habit of scratching the head among ignorant men when feeling at all puzzled.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Why do not you and I resort to the same practice? Simply because we know that it is an indelicate act, calling forth in our own minds, and in those of others, an unpleasant association! Now this was certainly not the case when the usages of good society were not so studied as at present.</p>
<p>If I remember rightly it was one of the early French Kings who said (when he had the itch) that scratching ought to be reserved as a Royal pastime! What should we say now if either of our much beloved Royal family so amused himself, or herself during a Levee? It then appears that even human beings derive great gratification from scratching, and we are fully aware how pleased almost all of our domesticated animals are when scratched, especially on the head, and, in the case of cows, on the rump. With regard to wild and semi-domesticated animals we need travel no further than the houses for monkeys and parrots in our own Zoological Gardens! Evidently then scratching must have been transmitted to us for countless ages through our barbarous and semi-barbarous progenitors— You most properly value the actions of idiots as giving us the truest and most reliable instances of reversion to ancestral habits.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have very often noticed how monkey-like are some of the actions of those poor human beings deprived of the power of reasoning. In this parish, and not many hundred yards from where I write, resides a poor idiotic youth. I see him almost daily, and have often noticed some of his most striking and characteristic actions: one of the the most notable being a constant habit of stopping suddenly in the road, pulling up the leg of his trousers catching an imaginary flea, killing it (or rather fancying that he was doing so) with both hands and close up to his eyes, although not at all short-sighted, and then scratching in quite a different place from where the supposed flea was troubling him, and this all in winter when fleas are usually dormant! I also recently had occasion to sit up with a friend who was suffering from <hi rend="underline">delirium</hi> tremens, and he was persistently catching fleas and scratching himself, especially about the forearms and lower extremity of the body.</p>
<p>Reverting to page 113 of “Expression” you seem to doubt on the authority of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bartlett that domestic pigs “crop” or draw back the ears when fighting.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Now M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bartlett is a most excellent observer, and I know few men whose opinions I would accept in preference to his, yet I doubt if even he is so good an authority on this matter as myself, having been a farmer all my life, and I can unhesitatingly state that domestic pigs do crop, or lay back their ears when fighting: so do also the semi-feral breeds of pigs in America.</p>
<p>I must now give you two additional instances of the effect of colour on animals. The first is that of a celebrated shorthorn bull (roan, if I remember rightly) which belonged to my father,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> and which invariably refused to be mated with a <hi rend="underline">black</hi> cow! The other refers to some parti-coloured and brown rabbits. On my return from Newfoundland in 1868 I had a large white and brown doe rabbit given me, which fortunately at the time proved to be in young. I turned her into a burrow in my orchard at Thruxton, which is very large and surrounded by a high thatched wall, and in which at the time there were many couples of the ordinary brown rabbits. These for a long time refused to associate with the new importation, but eventually overcame their predudices, and she brought forth her young in safety. In the course of eighteen months these parti-coloured rabbits had increased to about thirty couples, and within the next six, or eight months all had disappeared, although I had not shot more than a dozen of them! The extinction was caused by similarly coloured cats, which used to lay at the mouths of the burrows and catch and kill my rabbits as they came out to feed. Not only did the cats exterminate all the white and brown rabbits, but also nearly all those of the normal colour. These latter after becoming accustomed to the proximity of the white and brown rabbits were not sufficiently wary to detect a crouched cat when of a similar colour to the white and brown rabbits. Since the latter have all disappeared the brown rabbits are again increasing rapidly.</p>
<p>That they were destroyed by cats was evident from the quantity of skins, feet and intestines lying about all over the orchard. I could easily have trapped the cats and saved my rabbits, but that one of them was a splendid Persian cat that I had given my mother, and some of the others—white and white and yellow—belonged to a lady friend living at the Rectory.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I fear that you will be tired before reading all that I have written: I have also to bear in mind that “Greater Britain” will be impatient of my wasting so much of your valuable time.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Trusting therefore that you are feeling stronger than when I last heard from you,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> and with kind regards, | Believe me, dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin | very faithfully yours. | Henry Reeks</p>
<p>P.S. Now that you have my copy of “Expression” by you would you kindly gratify a whim of mine and write my name on the title page? <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
