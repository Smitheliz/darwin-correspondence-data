<p>Comments on SB’s book [<hi rend="italic">The fair haven</hi> (1873)]. CD is struck by SB’s dramatic power – thinks he could write "a really good novel". Surprised at strength of case SB makes that Jesus did not die on the cross. SB’s identity will soon be universally known: Leslie Stephen knows he is the author.</p>

<p>I have delayed thanking you for your present until I had read it through, which I have now done. It has interested me greatly &amp; is extremely curious.— If I had not known that you had written it, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not even have suspected that the author was not orthodox within the wide stated limits.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have thought that he was a conscientious man like Blanco White whose autobiography you no doubt know.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>It will be a curious problem whether the orthodox will have so good a scent as to detect your heresy.— I have just seen G. R. Greg<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; told him of the book, (but not of course who wrote it.〈)〉 &amp; he will read it.</p>
<p>He 〈re〉marked that the orthodox will read almost anything if not purposely made offensive to them; &amp; no one can say that you have done this. But you will soon be universally know: Leslie Stephen, a regular reviewer, who was lunching here, knew you were the author.— What has struck me much in your book, is your dramatic power,—that is the way in which you earnestly &amp; thoroughily assume the character, &amp; think the thoughts, of the man you pretend to be. Hence I conclude that you c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> write a really good novel.— I have been surprised at the strength of the case which you make for Jesus not having died on the cross;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> but I do not know whether to be convinced in the way of small criticisms—there seems too much reiteration in about the middle of the book. It would, I think, be well, when long &amp; many passages are in inverted commas to repeat who is speaking,—I got sometimes confused. Your book must have cost you much labour; &amp; I heartily hope it will be widely distributed; but it is not light reading.</p>
<p>I have been very sorry to hear of your strain: if you c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have come here, we sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have been very glad to have seen you at luncheon or dinner.—</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
