                    <date>15. April. 1869.</date>
                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I was much obliged for your kind 〈le〉tter &amp; for the suggestions it contained.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. 〈ha〉ve acknowledged it earlier but that I have been little able to write. I have sought out your letter written many years ago to me about Melastomes. I find it asks for information chiefly about any dimorphism of the sexual organs, such as you have observed in the allied order of Lythraceæ.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I recollect looking through my notes in vain for any record of such structure. The baccate<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Melastomaceæ, such as I chiefly gathered, have stamens remarkably equable in length, although usually in a double row. The filaments and anthers, white in some, yellow in others, are apt to turn rose and even purple after shedding their pollen, which (in these species) is 〈n〉ever green.</p>
<p>The only observation I have preserved about their fertilisation you will find in my ‘Report on Expedition to procure Red Bark Tree’;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but as it is unlikely you should have a copy of that Report I will copy it here.</p>
<p>“The first plant which took my attention at Limon,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> 〈af〉ter the Cinchona, was a beautiful epiphytal <hi rend="underline">Blakea</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> 〈gro〉wing from 12 to 18ft high with large coriaceous 〈lea〉ves &amp; large rose-coloured flowers. At the base of 〈the〉 flower is a turgid involucre, of four large orbicular, widely &amp; closely imbricated leaves, within which is secreted a limpid fluid. When the corolla falls away, the involucral leaves close firm〈ly〉 over the calyx, and do not open out, nor does the contained fluid dry up, until the globose ro〈s〉eate be〈  〉 the size of a pea, is quite ripe. Another singu〈lar〉 character is the <hi rend="underline">syngenesious</hi> anthers, with a minu〈te〉 pore at the apex of each cell, through which not a g〈rain〉 of pollen ever escapes, as I satisfied myself by repeated observation; fertilisation being effected through the agency of minute beetles, which abound in the flowers, and eat away the inner edge of the anther-cells—probably part of the pollen also.”</p>
<p>This is what I wrote on the spot, but I have no doubt now that the pollen, liberated by the beetles, falls on the honeyed disk, whence it is carried off by winged insects &amp; deposited on the stigmas of other flowers; for the stigma hangs out far beyond both petals &amp; stamens, therefore out of reach of the pollen as it falls into the centre of the flower.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that in this most geometrical of of all orders of flowering-plants—for the strongl〈y〉 ribbed leaves, often purple beneath, closely wired with the numerous parallel veins between the ribs, have reminded me of some delicate fabric of copper or cast-iron—the only departure from symmetry is in the style going out between the filaments on one side, so that the stigma becomes quite excentric to the flower   Sometimes the stamens are slightly declinate in the same direction as the style.* I have observed t〈hat〉 flies alighting on the flower use the large pelta〈te〉 stigma as a support for their hind legs whilst poking their noses into the disk. Surely here is an 〈i〉nstance of the effects of direct mechanical action 〈o〉n the part of insects, the style having become declinate through this perpetual “sagging” (as we say in Yorkshire, 〈but a〉s Shakespeare says it too I suppose the word is 〈go〉od English).<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>When I have seen flies tugging &amp; poking at the 〈s〉iphon-like corollas of some Gardoquias, Salvias, Siphocampyli, &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have said to myself “Surely these flowers have become arcuate through the long-continued action of the flies.”</p>
<p>I have not by me your charming book on the Fertilisation of Orchids,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> but I thought you had admitted in part the direct agency of insects in modifying the structure of the flowers. When my paper is printed I will take care not to attribute to you any opinions you do not really hold.</p>
<p>Does not Natural Selection balance all internal &amp; external influences, to the good of the individual, as 〈f〉ar as may be; and when opposing agencies become too strong for it, still keep up the struggle (as it were) to the last gasp?</p>
<p>There are some structures which (so far as we can see) are neither beneficial nor otherwise to plants and animals in their struggle for life. Such may b〈e〉 the sacs on the leaves of Tococas, which perhaps 〈  〉 not have attained to permanence except in a 〈reg〉ion where the climate scarcely varies throughout the year.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>If a gall were always to appear in the same part of a plant—if it could be permanently tenanted—if it c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be proved not prejudicial but possibly eve〈n〉 beneficial to the plant—I do not see why it shou〈ld〉 not become hereditary.</p>
<p>I have many times seen sacs on Tococa-leaves even full-grown ones—that were imperforate an〈d〉 therefore untenanted by ants: that alone proves t〈he〉sacs to be inherited. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think instances of th〈is〉 might be found on my specimens at Kew.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I wish 〈I〉 had them here &amp; c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. send you a leaf.</p>
<p>My only doubt is, if the ants really cultivate these sacs, as we cultivate cabbages &amp; turnips, w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not the saccate leaves become plane even in a few generations?</p>
<p>I do not see what influence the secretions of ants c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have on the Tococas, except in the way of manure. Dead vegetable tissues are by their action changed to the colour &amp; consistence of tinder, as my carefully put away linen has many times borne witness.</p>
<p>In fine, you must not let my speculations turn you aside from more important matters; but if at any time you think I may be able to furnish information that you require I will most gladly do it to the best of my ability.</p>
