<p>I thank you sincerely for your most kind note &amp; for your presents,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> which I shall value much &amp; shall no doubt receive in due time. I have long venerated your Father &amp; estimated his two great works most highly.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I can perfectly well believe that the “search after truth was the leading principle of his life &amp; labours”; I was thoroughily impressed with this, after reading them; &amp; strict conscientiousness seemed to me their noble &amp; prevailing character.—   I shall be very glad to read something of his life; for I remember some few years ago enquiring on the subject, as I had got to feel so much interest in his great labours; but did not then hear of his life.—</p>
<p>Your Father’s name is pretty well known in this country, but not so universally as it ought to be, &amp; not nearly well enough known in France, judging from such French Books as I read. If I can in ever so little degree make it more generally known I shall be pleased; &amp; in my larger work I shall have to quote him far oftener. But your Father’s works have enduring merit, &amp; will certainly be of high service to science many years after I am dead &amp; gone.—</p>
<p>With sincere thanks for your letter, which has given me much satisfaction, &amp; with my gratitude for your most kind presents, believe me Madam, with much respect, | Yours sincerely &amp; obliged | Charles Darwin</p>
