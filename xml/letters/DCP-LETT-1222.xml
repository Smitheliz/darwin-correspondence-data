<p>I was very glad to get your note. I have often been thinking of writing to you, but all the autumn &amp; winter I have been much dispirited &amp; inclined to do nothing but what I was forced to.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I saw two very nice notes of yours on the ocasion of my poor dear Father’s death. The memory of such a Father is a treasure to one; &amp; when last I saw him he was very comfortable &amp; his expression which I have now in my mind’s eye serene &amp; cheerful.—</p>
<p>Thank you much for your information about the water cure: I cannot make up my mind; I dislike the thoughts of it much— I know I shall be very uncomfortable there, &amp; such a job moving with <hi rend="doubleUnderline">6</hi> children. Can you tell me (&amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be much obliged sometime for an answer) whether either your cases was dyspepsia, though D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Holland does not consider my case quite that, but nearer to suppressed gout.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He says he never saw such a case, &amp; will not take on him to recommend the water cure.— I must get Gully’s Book.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>We shall indeed be very glad to see you here at any time; though Miss Annie is not <hi rend="underline">quite</hi> ready to be married yet: the new handwriting is our Governesses.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Do you remember recommending me to tie up our fruit trees like besoms— well I did so, &amp; then wrote Gardeners Chronic to ask his opinion<ref target="#foot.f5"/> —&amp; he answered “cut loose at once or you will spoil all your trees”; but I kept 2 or 3 pears &amp; plums—standard &amp; wall, tyed for experiment, &amp; they answered wonderfully this summer being the only trees of several of same age which bore fruit—&amp; made hardly any wood—one little Pear on wall had 90.— Have you gone on with this plan? do tell us, ie Comfort<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; myself, as we are both very curious to hear.— We are now trying Apricots &amp; Peaches.—</p>
<p>Pray give our kind remembrances to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Fox, &amp; believe my dear old Friend | Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>

He further remarked that many chronic nervous and dyspepsic symptoms were relieved, or even ceased, with the first fit of gout (p. 123).
