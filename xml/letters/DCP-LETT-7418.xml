<p rend="centre"><hi rend="underline">Odd odds and ends</hi> <ref target="#foot.f2"/></p> 
<p>I was teaching my Wife<ref target="#foot.f3"/> how to “develope” a collodion photogr.— —saying “now pour this evenly over the plate—there—now move the plate gently up &amp; down”— — She moved her head to &amp; fro but held the plate quite level— I saw her curls swaying   She stood so for nearly a minute before I <hi rend="underline">awoke</hi> her. I was so interested— but the hand was still— so intent she was in listening, that the connection betw. the hand and brain was suspended— in fact, the brain rocked without communicating the action to the hand— She often talks in her sleep—</p>
<p>“He looked very sheepish” = some one baffled etc   When to express that the <hi rend="underline">exulting</hi> party puts his thumb to his nose with extended fingers to imitate a long face.? (<hi rend="underline">The Origin of gestures</hi>)</p>
<p>Some rub the palms of their hands briskly together at any success in joke or otherwise.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Complacently</hi> stroking the beard raising, the chin &amp; lips</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">A searching look</hi>— half-shutting the eyelids fixing the eyes steadily on the object.</p>
<p>Indignation—challenging— Head erect, thrown back nostrils expanded—superciliary muscles projecting lips compressed—or if accomp. with contempt the corners of the mouth drawn down—the attitude ready for combat—</p>
<p>“He looked as dropped from the Skye” A vacant look, mouth open Arm hanging as lifeless at the sides—etc</p>
<p>“Crestfallen” A man sitting both hands on the knees head drooping—jaw drooping—the eyelids extended they eyes rather diverging being fixed on no object—</p>
<p>Aversion disgust— Much like the expr. of suddenly experience a bitter taste—</p>
<p>Mrs. W. told me of having several nights watched her husband go out of bed in the middle of the night<ref target="#foot.f4"/> (He was subject to epileptic fits) go downstairs and write a letter, in a good hand—<hi rend="underline">Upside down</hi>!</p>
<p>—A Certain Officer On Parade, quite sober, (within my knowledge) sheathed his Sabre and walked on towards home—unconscious of breach of discipline—(He got one days arrest only)—</p>
<p>In writing—omitting words, habitually or letters—</p>
<p>In reading—for the eye to catch letters lower down—</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Astonishment</hi> simple = Head &amp; neck extended mouth open as if the eyes &amp; ears were not sufficient to recieve the impress.—</p>
<p>Astonishment with wonder—hands—showing the palms—raised the eyes wide open eyebrows arched, the mouth open but rounded for the interjection Oh. head thrown back—</p>
<p>Astonishment—agreeable— Hands raised, as before, eyes dilated eyebrows raised head rather on one side slightly bent and a suppressed smile—</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Contempt</hi>: the body averted head turned to the object the eyes looking ascant—corners of the mouth drawn downwards with an expression about the nose as if something smelt disagreably—</p>
<p>A Sneer—a disguised contempt accompanied with and awkward forced smile on <hi rend="underline">one</hi> side the face—</p>
<p>The same by a female accompanied by a sudden puff of <hi rend="underline">whispering</hi>-<hi rend="underline">breath</hi> and a sudden jerk of her drapery on the side of the dis. object towards herself to blow away the “persistent” air and afraid that even the hem of her garment should be touched— male= poh! poh!</p>
<p>(Pleading, apologetically—“as stated”—only add a most defencless attitude)</p>
<p>Spitting—defiance— at a person</p>
<p>d<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. contempt— on the ground</p>
<p>(Llamas spit their undigested food that raises a blister on the skin)</p>
<p>Showing the tounge by way of insult children &amp; very low persons show it broadly &amp; far out   Grown up females do it pointedly &amp; quickly</p>
<p>Silly people often play the tounge over the lower lip—</p>
<p>(Hunchbacked—club-footed child much squinting children more mischievous expecially the squinting)</p>
<p>Furtive looks</p>
<p>The pouting child both lips out if angry—<hi rend="underline">as well</hi>— the underlip only if sad—called the “dripping-pan”—</p>
<p>The sigh deep in thought &amp; feeling paralysing the action of the breathing untill a forcible vent is found in a Sigh—</p>
<p>A violent sigh from suppressed anger in man passive offensive derision <hi rend="underline">or spite</hi>—by wrinkling the nose to some one—</p>
<p>Stamping the foot in anger or command (fem)</p>
<p>Snapping the fingers in contempt (male)</p>
<p>Striking the hand on a table—</p>
<p>Striking a closed fist in the palm of the other (female)</p>
<p>Speaking with the teeth clenched in a growl-like voice—(male)</p>
<p>Grief—the inner point of the eyebrows raised</p>
<p>Anger—the inner point of eyebrows depressed</p>
<p>The hands!!!</p>
<p>Raised over the head imploring palms out</p>
<p>Down at the sides—expostulating d<hi rend="superscript">o</hi></p>
<p>extended Horizontally—Open to receive</p>
<p>Fingers</p>
<p>pointing with the thumb “over the left’ also really in earnest</p>
<p>forefinger most direct</p>
<p>middle finger—common men</p>
<p>Ring finger the same</p>
<p>Little finger Children—Ladies and many well bred persons—</p>
<p>Forefinger upright—perpendicly = warning</p>
<p>Closed fist extended—threat—</p>
<p>Forefinger to the side of the nose—knowing</p>
<p>D<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> to the forehead—thinking—with difficulty—</p>
<p>Forefinger to the mouth = Silence</p>
<p>Hand behind the ear = hearing</p>
<p>Forefingers in the ear = not hearing</p>
<p>One hand drawn smartly across the other palm means ‘<hi rend="underline">nothing</hi>’</p>
<p>Some people cannot hold the fingers still— Dying people have begun scratching the clothes just before going—</p>
<p>Babies toes move with the fingers</p>
<p>An uneasy cough—or cough to show (wanted) indifference</p>
<p>A Whistle to gain assurance</p> 
<p rend="centre"><hi rend="underline">Sympathy</hi></p> 
<p>Yawning (I could make my Dog yawn)</p>
<p>Sick at sights</p>
<p>The mouth watering at acids</p>
<p>The teeth “set on edge” at the slip of the knife on a plate or filing a saw</p>
<p>Smacking the lips</p> 
<p rend="centre">Tricks</p> 
<p>Biting the nails</p>
<p>sucking the thumb or the tounge</p>
<p>Blinking—.</p>
<p>While reading keep moving the fingers in search of inequalities—</p>
<p>Draw the air suddenly thro’ the nose</p>
<p>The Scotch— Hm! Hm! = response</p>
<p>Danish So–So</p>
<p>Also a sucking noise = indeed or “dear oh me”</p>
<p>Country-Engld AAh!</p>
<p>Swedish jah! jah-ah!?</p>
<p>The occupier Clark of the Shop of this Mansion<ref target="#foot.f5"/> has a bull-terrier which I had not seen before the other night (nor he me—) when (late) I passed the shop and the terrier ran at me head down— I was apprehensive of attack but he wagged his tail and sneezed with pleasure to recognise me— — How— by scent knowing me to be an inmate of the house— —</p>
<p>The other night I went into Alvarez’s Cig. Shop and the She-Cat there (opera Colonade)<ref target="#foot.f6"/> was most anxious—as only a cat can be—for a male companion— I saw it—&amp; having learnt some of their calls—I made the—endearing noise—of a Cat and up got her pelvis—down on her breast— ready— I repeated it several times to show the owner it was no accident</p>
<p>A Dog even a strange dog will generally repeat my Uffh! Uffh! being the first noise of <hi rend="underline">warning</hi> of distant danger by dogs— My Dog could say my friends name, Hoof, when asked and if not saying it plainly repeat it—at my order—untill well pronounced he generally knowing when that was by jumping about, pleased, immediately</p>
<p>The brain of my clever Dog I have, carefully, compared to that of a Childs at one year and 3 months—not even to 1<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> year— —(too long to argue)</p>
<p>Grangers Barndoor Cock who had two horns<figure type="diagram" rend="floatRight width25">

                            </figure> hanging at each side—artificially produced in a cruel
                            way   I have seen two—a man near Wolverhampton did it. The
                            bone was laid bare on either side &amp; then hartshorn &amp; something
                            else was rubbed over the bone.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>A child was lately brought to the Kings college that had the tail of a dog which it wagged like a dog. I think the whole lower part was that of a dog. Mr Dawson of K. College was my informant—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
