<p>Thanks for AG’s review of <hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Am. J. Sci.</hi> 3d ser. 15 (1878): 67–73].</p> 
            <p>Thomas Carlyle’s letter about CD was a forgery.</p> 
<p>Gives Hermann Müller’s observations on <hi rend="italic">Valeriana dioica</hi>.</p> 
            <p>Is unsure about function of "bloom"; are glaucous plants more or less common in arid parts of U. S.?</p>
            <p>Observations on heliotropism.</p>
            <p>Thomas Meehan reports that Linum perenne is self-fertile; CD thinks that he has mistaken the species.</p>

<p>I received 2 or 3 days ago your review of my Forms of Flowers, which has pleased &amp; as usual instructed me much.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I was specially pleased at my suggestion of giving names to the subdivisions of polygamous plants being approved of by you.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Thanks, also, for the review of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Cook, written, I suppose by you.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> It seems to me rather too mild, but I have been very glad to read &amp; have been amused by it.— By the way Carlyle’s letter about me was a forgery, or as he said to my Brother,—“it is all infernal lies”.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Could you not get some young man to experiment on &amp; observe grades of fertility of Epigæa &amp; Rhamnus. &amp;c. Herman Müller describes <hi rend="underline">Valeriana dioica</hi> as consisting of 4 analogous forms. He attributes their case primarily to the existence of 2 forms, one with larger &amp; the other with smaller corolla, such as he has shown exist in other cases; but his German was obscure, &amp; I could not follow the further supposed transformations.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I hope that you have got over the first great press of accumulated work &amp; are now not so much overworked. I hope tomorrow to see Hooker, for I am writing this in London, to which place I have come for a few days rest after working rather too hard.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>My son Frank &amp; I have been observing the autonomous movements of seedlings &amp; those due to Heliotropism, which latter from their complexity have almost driven us mad.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>We have made out something, but not very much about the uses of bloom or the waxy secretion on the leaves &amp; stems of plants.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Did you notice whether such glaucous plants are more or less common in the arid countries to the west or centre than in the more humid districts on the Atlantic?</p>
<p>You know my opinion of all American ladies, so you will believe how delighted we have been at my son marrying Sara Sedgwick—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> She is in every possible way quite charming.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately | Ch Darwin <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
<p rend="left">Jan 21</p>
<p>P.S. | I forgot to add the following as I wished to do yesterday. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meehan in a paper lately read before the Philadelphia Soc. says in a somewhat sneering tone that plants behave differently in one country from another for that a single plant of <hi rend="underline">Linum perennes</hi> brought from Colorado by him was quite fertile with him, where I state (confirmed he might have added by Hildebrand) that it is absolutely sterile with its own pollen.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Now he does not state whether his plant was long-styled or short-styled, &amp; as he speaks of bringing the plant from Colorado, I imagine that it was there endemic. Does <hi rend="underline">L. perenne</hi> grow there? D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alefeld says <hi rend="underline">none</hi> of the true American species are heterostyled.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Now if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meehan has mistaken the species it seems to me too bad to throw a slur or doubt on another man’s accuracy without taking the smallest pains to be accurate himself. I have been almost tempted to write formally to the Phil. Soc. to enquire how the case really stands. But I have resolved not to do so, as Hildebrand has fully confirmed my statement.— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Meehans inaccuracy seems to me injurious in no small degree to Science</p>
<p>C.D</p>
<p>I have just spent a delightful 2 hours at Kew, &amp; heard prodigies of your strength &amp; activity. That you run up a mountain like a cat!—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
