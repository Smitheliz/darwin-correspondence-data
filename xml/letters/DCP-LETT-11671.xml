                    <p>I am most heartily glad that your Lecture (just received &amp; read) has been so eminently successful.— You have indeed passed a most magnificent eulogium on me, &amp; I wonder that you were not afraid of hearing “oh, oh”, or some other sign of disapprobation.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Many persons think that what I have done in science has been much overrated, &amp; I very often think so myself; but my comfort is that I have never consciously done anything to gain applause.— Enough &amp; too much about my dear self.— The sole fault which I find with your Lecture is that it is too short, &amp; this is a rare fault— It strikes me as <hi rend="underline">admirably</hi> clear &amp; interesting. I meant to have remonstrated that you had not discussed sufficiently, the necessity of signs for the formation of abstract ideas of any complexity, &amp; then I came on the discussion on deaf-mutes.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> This latter seems to me one of the richest of all the mines, &amp; is worth working carefully for years &amp; very deeply. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to read whole chapters on this one head, &amp; others on the minds of the higher idiots.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Nothing can be better, as it seems to me, than your several lines or sources of evidence, &amp; the manner in which you have arranged the whole subject.</p>
                    <p> Your book will assuredly be worth years of hard labour, &amp; stick to your subject.— By the way I was pleased at your discussing the selection of varying instincts or mental tendencies, for I have often been disappointed by no one ever having noticed this notion.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>I have just finished “La Psychologie son present et son avenir” 1876 by Delbœuf (a mathematician &amp; physicist of Belgium) in about 100 pages: it has interested me a good deal, but why I hardly know; it is rather like Herbert Spencer: if you do not know it, &amp; w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> care to see it, send me a Post-card.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>Thank Heaven we return home on Thursday, &amp; I shall be able to go on with my hum-drum work &amp; that makes me forget my daily discomfort.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>Have you ever thought of keeping a young monkey, so as to observe its mind: at a house where we have been staying there were Sir A. &amp; Lady Hobhouse, not long ago returned from India, &amp; she (&amp; he) kept these young monkeys &amp; told me some curious particulars.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> One was that her monkey was very fond of looking through her eye-glass at objects &amp; moved the glass nearer &amp; further so as to vary the focus: this struck me, as Frank’s son,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> nearly 2 years old (&amp; we think much of his intellect!!) is very fond of looking through my pocket lens, &amp; I have <hi rend="underline">quite in vain</hi> endeavoured to teach him not to put the glass close down on the object, but he will always do so. Therefore I conclude that a child—just under 2 years is inferior in intellect to a monkey.</p>
<p>Once again I heartily congratulate you on your well earned present, &amp; I feel assured grand future success. | Yours very truly | Ch. Darwin</p>
