<p>The above was cut from a paper at a distance &amp; sent me yesterday. I feel flattered at the bracketting </p>
<p>I am so full of my insectivorous plants that I cannot keep from writing about them, their interest is so intense.</p>
<p>I have quite failed to obtain any evidence of a conclusive character that the leaves absorb after having digested: but I notice that my Dionoea leaves open after macerating a blue bottle for 12 or 14 days, full of fluid &amp; that fluid containing abundance of nitrogenous matter, runs down a channel on the leaf stalk to the root</p>
<p>For manure? Fancy each Dionoea leaf a little patent manure manufactory!<ref target="#foot.f4"/> </p>
<p>Now I find that the Aldrovandra  is stated to float on stagnant waters in the South of Europe, but I have never seen it and can’t find any statement that it is either fly-catching or fly digesting.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> If it is either it would rather tend to upset my view</p>
<p>Can it be got? I have tried many places but cannot hear of any source</p>
<p>There are some very curious facts in support of my sewage notion about the Sarracenia,<ref target="#foot.f6"/>  but I must wait &amp; see &amp; not trouble you too much, only this seems to me such a quaint notion that I could not help writing it.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully, | Lawson Tait</p>

Tait’s lecture to the Birmingham Natural History Society on the function of tails, which included material quoted from CD’s letter to him of [13–15 March 1875], was delivered on 5 April 1875 and summarised in the <hi rend="italic">Birmingham Daily Post</hi>, 8 April 1875, p. 6. It was reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Hardwicke’s Science-Gossip</hi>, June 1875, pp. 126–7 (Tait 1875a; see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9885.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Lawson Tait, 12 March [1875]</ref>).</note>
