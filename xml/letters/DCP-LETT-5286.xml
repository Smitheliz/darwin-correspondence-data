<p>I long to say My dear Charles—but cannot venture upon that liberty with so renowned a man—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Rosamond is at present staying with the Corbets—at the nice place they have taken near Oxford<ref target="#foot.f3"/>—&amp; she has just written to ask me by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Corbets desire to write to you— He is the blind M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Corbet—who is I believe an acquaintance of yours<ref target="#foot.f4"/>—but any how he has sent to ask me to write—&amp;, as one never denies that dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Corbet anything—I trouble you with this— He has been troubled now, for more than a year—with poor health—nothing very important the matter—I believe—only just the destruction of all his comfort from constant malaise—fits of sleeplessness—depression of spirit—dislike to mental exertion—even a dread of those scientific &amp; intellectual conversations in which he used to take all his delight— in short every one who has been thoroughly out of order knows the whole horrid <hi rend="underline">dragons</hi> of such a state— Hearing from Rosamond what diet has done for you<ref target="#foot.f5"/>—in which all to your most distant friends so heartily rejoice—he has desired her—“to ask if you would mind to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Charles Darwin to ask what was the diet he pursued— he is an old friend of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Corbets but they have not corresponded for some years— he would be glad if you would tell him— he has often thought of his old friend &amp; felt for his sufferings— I have told M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Corbet<ref target="#foot.f6"/> how much better M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin has been for diet—&amp; he is anxious to know the particulars— I am convinced a great part of his miserable feelings arise from his inattention to these matters—.... Poor man he suffers very much— if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin or M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin<ref target="#foot.f7"/> would write to him straight—he would be very glad—&amp; would like so much to hear from his old friend” So far Rosamond—&amp; if you or M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin would be so kind as to write direct to him—I am sure that the letter would be a great gratification—as well as far more likely to have its due effect— I must beg of you not to give one moment of your precious strength to acknowledging this letter— I have just heard from Elizabeth W<ref target="#foot.f8"/> how well you are &amp; heartily heartily rejoice</p>
<p>Kindest love to Emma (M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin) I mean— I did so grieve to lose my own share—in sweetest Susan<ref target="#foot.f9"/>—but they go away so sadly fast—those I loved in early happy days</p>
<p>Always believe me to be | very truly yours | Anne Marsh Caldwell</p>
