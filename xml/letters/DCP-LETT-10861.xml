<p>I take the liberty of reporting to you what seems to me to be a remarkable case of Atavism.</p>
<p>The common cattle of the United States are, as you know, descended from colonial and subsequent importations from England and Scotland, with a few from the continent. Bred without care they have lost all breed marks. Seven years ago my attention was attracted by a number of white cows with red ears and noses. upon enquiry I learned that some 15 or 20 years ago a White Short-Horn bull ran on the commons hereabout. Since then I have found similarly marked cattle in various parts of this state and learn from correspondents that they occur in New York state, Kentucky and Virginia. In every case where I have been able to get any history of these cattle they are said to be decendants of a cross between short-Horn bulls and native cows. This peculiar marking only occurs after several removes from the Short-horn and when the cattle have been neglected— The point of interest with me is the close resemblance between these cattle and the Chillingham Cattle as described in your Plants &amp; Animals under Domestication.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It is a notable fact that among the native or scrub cattle solid whites are rarely, or never found where no Short-Horn blood has been introduced.</p>
<p>If these facts are of any interest to you I shall be gratified—</p>
<p>With great respect | Hunter Nicholson | (Prof. Agr. Tenn Agr. College.) | Knoxville Tenn. | U.SA.</p>
