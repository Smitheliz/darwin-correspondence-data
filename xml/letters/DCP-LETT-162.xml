<p>Your Sisters tell me they informed you in their last letter of the awful and important event that is going again to take place here— My fate is indeed decided, the die is cast—and my dear Charles I feel quite certain I have not a friend in the world more sincerely in my welfare than you are, or one that will be so truly glad to hear I have every prospect of Happiness before me in the lot I have chosen— I have known M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Biddulph a long time, and always liked him extremely, thought him <hi rend="doubleUnderline">most</hi> <hi rend="underline">agreable</hi>, and good hearted, but on more intimate acquaintance I do feel convinced he possesses every quality to make me happy, is most sincerely &amp; (<hi rend="underline">Heaven knows</hi>) <hi rend="underline">disinterestedly</hi> attached to me—in short I do think mine is a <hi rend="underline">happy</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">end</hi>, I have no misgivings about it—tho it is indeed an awful and a melancholy thing to leave ones quiet happy Home,—&amp; all those people one has lived with &amp; loved from childhood— I cannot help feeling low when I think of that, but to think I shall only be 10 miles from the poor dear, old Forest, is a delightful consideration— My dear Charles I will not prose any more on my own affairs, I know you are interested in all that concerns me or I should not have written so much— I would give a great deal to see you again &amp; have one more merry chat, whilst I am still Fanny Owen—but alas that cannot be, but believe my dear Charles that no change of <hi rend="underline">name</hi> or condition can ever alter or diminish the feelings of sincere regard &amp; affection I have for <hi rend="underline">years</hi> had for you, and as soon as you return from your wanderings, I shall be <hi rend="underline">much</hi> <hi rend="underline">offended</hi> if one of your first rides is not to see <hi rend="underline">me</hi> at Chirk Castle,—and find out what curious Beetles the place <hi rend="underline">produces</hi> — I do not know, if you have ever seen M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Biddulph—one thing I must tell you—that the <hi rend="underline">firm</hi> <hi rend="underline">Catherine</hi> had a most violent prejudice against him, but I have made her come here to meet him, and <hi rend="underline">even</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">she</hi> with her <hi rend="underline">well</hi> <hi rend="underline">known</hi> <hi rend="underline">firmness</hi>, has now become a perfect convert, and declares <hi rend="underline">she</hi> thinks him a <hi rend="underline">piece</hi> of <hi rend="underline">Perfection</hi>. I only mention this little anecdote as I think it may speak <hi rend="underline">for</hi> <hi rend="underline">him</hi>,— knowing as we <hi rend="underline">all</hi> <hi rend="underline">do</hi> how firm Cath—<hi rend="underline">can</hi> <hi rend="underline">be</hi>! Papa has been writing you a very long Budget and I fear told you all the news there is in these parts, which does not amount to much— Poor Arthur I suppose will sail for India about May or June— I shall be very sorry to see him go, poor fellow, he is a nice well disposed Boy, I do not think he is very happy in the prospect of going to India— Sarah &amp; her <hi rend="underline">Hubby</hi> seem to go on very happily. She has just got into her new House in Belgrave Square, seems to lead a very gay life— You have heard too of your favorite Charlotte Wedgewoods intended marriage, that seems to have been quite a <hi rend="underline">Bubble</hi>, she went to London, met him, &amp; all was settled <hi rend="underline">in a fortnight</hi>. indeed the marriage fever seems to rage in Shropshire this year. Miss Parker has taken <hi rend="underline">to her care</hi> that lively young Baronet Sir Baldwin Leighton. Miss Fanny Sparling they say is shortly to be united to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Dry</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Corbet</hi> — I dare say the infection will soon spread to your sisters— I should think poor <hi rend="underline">Forlorn</hi> <hi rend="underline">Hope</hi> <ref target="#foot.f1"/> wished it had, when he tried his luck there some time ago— I hope you continue to like your Captain as much as on first acquaintance I hope too my dear Charles your expedition is answering all your most sanguine expectations, that you are enjoying yourself in every way as much as possible—and when you do return to the little Parsonage, and want <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">little</hi> <hi rend="underline">wife</hi>, “pray give me a commission to look out for her—” Alas Miss C. Salway<ref target="#foot.f2"/> is <hi rend="underline">lost</hi> <hi rend="underline">to you</hi> —but I have no doubt she may be replaced— I have not made much use of the old Painting Turret lately— What fun we <hi rend="underline">have had</hi> in that poor old room—what happy days we have had together dear Charles— I cannot tell you how much we all miss you here, &amp; how very often we talk about you— You are the Governor’s <hi rend="underline">first</hi> <hi rend="underline">favorite</hi> I assure you he now seems quite happy in writing to you— I do not know at all when I shall be <hi rend="underline">twined</hi> <hi rend="underline">off</hi> as Owen calls it, but probably some time in April. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Biddulph is at present in London attending his parliamentary duties, <hi rend="underline">fighting</hi> for Reform— I must now conclude this scrawl,—most anxiously my dear Charles shall I ever hope to hear of your happiness and prosperity, and remember you will always find me the same sincere friend I have been to you ever since we were <hi rend="underline">Housemaid</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Postillion</hi> together, and you must not forget your engagement to come &amp; see me in the <hi rend="underline">old</hi> <hi rend="underline">Castle</hi> as soon as you reach again y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. native place—</p>
<p>Now adieu, and Heaven bless you my very dear Charles— | Believe me always yr | Sincerely attached | Fanny Owen *S 2</p>
