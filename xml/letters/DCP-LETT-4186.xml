<p>Here I have a letter of yours a month old to acknowledge—a thing that rarely happens, you must allow.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> On 3 successive post-days I have sat down for it, or endeavored to do so. But a regular whirl of business, of one sort or other has prevented</p>
<p>I counted on 2 or 3 hours this morning; but two of my neighbors have got squabbling over a Report I have to read at the Anniversary Meeting of the American Academy to-day,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> and have wasted my time horribly, and distracted my brain, so that I am quite unfit to write to you. Yet I must drop a line, lest you should think me dead or worse.</p>
<p>From what you &amp; Hooker &amp; Boott had written about the sparring in the Athenæum I was anxious to see the nos.—but did not go to look it up at the Library, &amp;c—as it comes to me thro’ Boott, tho, tardily.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But the no. which contained Falconers attack on Lyell has failed. I suppose it may have gone down in the Anglo-Saxon.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> And the nos. of April 18 &amp; 25—reached me only 3 or 4 days ago!</p>
<p>I have read Lyell’s reply to Falconer—which appears to dispose of him,— and Prestwich’s letter, and Falconers rejoinder, I believe.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>This all seems to me a miserable business on the part of F. &amp; P. I see no reasonable ground of excuse for their conduct. They appear childish.—</p>
<p>Your letter on <hi rend="underline">Heterogeny</hi> is keen &amp; good.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Owen’s rejoinder ingenious.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> But his dissent from your well-put claims of Nat. Sel. to attention &amp; regard, is good for nothing <hi rend="underline">except</hi> on the admission of the view that species are <hi rend="underline">somehow</hi> derived genealogically—&amp; this I judge from various of Owen’s statements that he really in his heart believes to be the case,—and was (as I long ago intimated my suspicions) hunting about for some system of derivation, when your book came down upon him like a thunder-clap.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Carpenter is weak: lacks <hi rend="underline">nerve</hi> perhaps.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Wyman, here, is greatly pleased with Huxley’s book on Man’s place in Nature.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I have not even seen it.</p>
<p>Dana is dabbling in “<hi rend="underline">cephalization</hi>”.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I wish he could be <hi rend="underline">cephalized</hi> more himself—at least could be made <hi rend="underline">harder-headed</hi>. He is far too idealistic to ever make the naturalist he was intended for. He has capital points, but his head runs away with him.</p>
<p>Agassiz is writing very maundering geology &amp; zoology, and worse botany (fossil) in the Atlantic Magazine.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> He tells his readers that the <hi rend="underline">embryology</hi> of trilobites (about which not a fact is existant) is better known than that of Crabs!!<ref target="#foot.f13"/> He “is joined to his idols”,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> and I have no expectation that he will ever be of any more direct use in nat. history. I hope better of his son,<ref target="#foot.f15"/> who may do something.</p>
<p>Did you ever notice how prettily <hi rend="underline">Iris</hi> is arranged for cross-fertilizing, by bees, &amp;c.?</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="underline">Linum</hi> paper has long been here—<ref target="#foot.f16"/> But I have actually not had time to read it. I might have glanced at it. But I find it best to read only when I can do so with some attention.</p>
<p>You must had had Cypripediums out.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">C. arietinum</hi>—I had one blossom only—most of my stock was sent to you—is a very <hi rend="underline">clear</hi> case—wholly confirming my notion—which is so obvious that nobody could fail to see it. The surface of the stigma is unusually bristly, I think, i.e—the papillæ longer than in the others—in proportion.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>What you say from Edinb. will whet my curiosity to look into Gymnadenia 3-dentata.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> If the case amounts to anything I will put buds &amp; flowers into spirit for you.</p>
<p>On Cypripediums, you had better print a note, in Gard. Chronicle, when you have seen all the flowers you can.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>It <hi rend="underline">was</hi> sly of you to cite Lyell, p. 469—<ref target="#foot.f21"/> I had not seen this before, having only the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> ed. A very considerable change from the first ed. and one that may well satisfy you.<ref target="#foot.f22"/></p>
<p>Your question Ohio l〈aw〉s of marriage I have forgotten to ask about, I will enquire.<ref target="#foot.f23"/></p>
<p>Phyllotaxis   I have no notion in the world why the angular divergence should be of <hi rend="underline">that series</hi> of nos. &amp; not of others.<ref target="#foot.f24"/> <hi rend="underline">Opposite</hi> leaves give (decussating) the angle <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula>. My puzzle has been to account for this system in <hi rend="underline">cycles</hi> in leaves running into the system of decussating <hi rend="underline">whorls</hi>, in flowers, (usually almost universally)   You will see, the question by comparing in my Bot. Text. Book (not Lessons), pp. 236–237, with Chapt. V, sect. 1,—and you see I have drawn an illustration from it apropos to Falconer’s remark.<ref target="#foot.f25"/> But explaining the obscure by the obscure does not amount to much.</p>
<p>As to National affairs, how quarrelsome you English are. Here are we cooly &amp; quietly occupied with our little affairs, never dreaming of harm from you,—and your people are trying their prettiest to pick a quarrel with us,—because we do what <hi rend="underline">Historicus</hi> says the English have always done &amp; will do again when the time comes, having Lord Stowell to back them!<ref target="#foot.f26"/> Tell me, who is <hi rend="underline">Historicus</hi> in the Times.?<ref target="#foot.f27"/> An able &amp; most influential person, evidently.</p>
<p>The Government of England are now showing sense.<ref target="#foot.f28"/> Do not wonder that some wild talk is given to the air in this rough country, after what you have heard in House of Commons, &amp; read in Times, &amp;c   I am afraid we shall not like each other for a good while—the nations— But all shows I was right. We must carry out our little job, &amp; hold the <hi rend="underline">U.S.</hi> complete, &amp; develop material strength at any cost,—or we could not live without eating more dirt than we like.</p>
<p>Boasting nonsense is pretty well knocked out of us, by severe discipline &amp; sad reverses,—but the <hi rend="underline">determination</hi> is stronger than ever.</p>
<p>Time up, &amp; paper full. Forgive my maundering—&amp; believe me to be | Ever Your affectionate | A Gray.</p>

Gray, however, was convinced that pollination was effected by insects, probably flies, crawling bodily into the flower. Gray also pointed out that the rigid papillae on the stigma were well adapted to brushing the pollen from the insect’s head or back (A. Gray 1862a, p. 428).
