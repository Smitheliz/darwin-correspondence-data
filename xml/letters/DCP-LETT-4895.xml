<p>I am very much obliged for your interesting letter written in such wonderfully good English about climbing plants.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The case of Haplolophium is new to me &amp; I am glad to have seen the tendril of Strychnos.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I do not suppose I shall attend any more to climbing plants, but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to hear if you ever meet with 2 species of the same genus, twining in opposite directions<ref target="#foot.f4"/>   I should further like much to hear whether any twiners can ascend thick trunks.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> How wonderfully rich you are in climbing plants! As I see you know much more about plants than I do, I sent off by the post yesterday a German copy of my Orchis book &amp; two papers on Dimorphism.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The latter will I think interest you &amp; perhaps one Chapter, for instance that on Catasetum in my Orchis book <hi rend="underline">w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> </hi> be worth your reading to shew how perfect the contrivances are.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Your remarks on the spines <hi rend="underline">in</hi> Acasta are quite new to me &amp; seem very probable.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> In my last letter I alluded to Anelasma; I am not sure, but I think I speculated on the relation of the branching filaments to cement tubes, but rejected the idea on account of the apparent continuity of the filaments with the outer membrane of the Capitulum.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Perhaps I may have made some mistake for your view now seems to me probable.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> My specimen unfortunately had been removed out of the Sharks flesh.</p>
<p>The difficulty which you quote from A. Agassiz on the embryology of the Echinodermata is quite beyond me &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> think w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be just the subject for you.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Any how the difficulty is quite as great to L. Agassiz on his views of classification as to us on descent &amp; modification, &amp; that is some comfort.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Does it not often strike you that Natural History is rendered extremely interesting by such views as we both hold. This frequently occurred to me when reading your work. I am sorry to say my health keeps so weak that I am not able to do any scientific work. If you write again I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> very much like to hear whether you intend to remain long at Desterro &amp; how you like your new home   I have always heard the Island is most beautiful<ref target="#foot.f13"/>   Have you ever read my Journal of Researches or Travels &amp; if not w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> you like to have a copy.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>

The section of the letter containing Müller’s observation on spines in the barnacle <hi rend="italic">Acasta</hi> has not been found. <hi rend="italic">Acasta</hi>, classified by CD as a subgenus of <hi rend="italic">Balanus</hi>, is a barnacle usually found attached to sponges (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854)</ref>, pp. 176–7; for the modern classification, see Newman 1996, pp. 502–3). CD had described the cirri in many species of <hi rend="italic">Acasta</hi> as remarkable because of the existence of spines on the fourth pair of cirri (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854)</ref>, p. 306). Müller’s observation almost certainly concerned his discovery of a species of sponge-dwelling <hi rend="italic">Balanus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Balanus armatus</hi>, that had spines on the third pair of cirri. In a <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Max Johann Sigismund Schultze of 10 November 1864</ref>, Müller had discussed his observations on this species (the letter is published in Möller ed. 1915–21, 2: 58). Müller’s description of <hi rend="italic">B. armatus</hi> was published in Müller 1867; an English version appeared the next year (Müller 1868a). In the article, Müller referred to the spines as an example of analogous variation similar to the air-breathing apparatus in some crabs that he had observed earlier (Müller 1867, pp. 344–5, and Müller 1868a, pp. 404–5; see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4881.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Fritz Müller, 10 August [1865]</ref> and n. 5).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851)</ref>, pp. 169–80, CD had noted that he found neither cement nor cement glands in <hi rend="italic">Anelasma squalicola</hi>, but concluded that the organism probably became attached in the first instance in the normal way, that is by cement glands, but then was ‘retained in its place, by being so deeply imbedded in the shark’s body, and perhaps by the root-like branched filaments’ (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 174). CD eventually concluded that the filaments were not modified cement ducts but originated in the outer membrane, which he described as continuous from the capitulum (the main body of the barnacle, which remained on the exterior of the host) to the peduncle (the stalk-like portion, which became embedded at the site of attachment); see <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 173, 380–1, and pl. IV, figs. 2 and 3. CD did not encounter Rhizocephala when he worked on barnacles, but, after reading Müller 1864, he had suggested to Müller that <hi rend="italic">Anelasma</hi> might represent a connecting link between Rhizocephala and other cirripedes (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4881.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Fritz Müller, 10 August [1865]</ref> and n. 7). CD evidently reconsidered the origin of the branched filaments of <hi rend="italic">Anelasma</hi>, seeing them as an intermediate stage between the cement ducts of other cirripedes and the root-like tubes in Rhizocephala.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Müller’s observations on the relation between branched filaments in <hi rend="italic">Anelasma</hi> and the root-like tubes of Rhizocephala are in the missing section of the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4881A.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Fritz Müller, 12 August 1865</ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4912A.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Fritz Müller, 10 October 1865</ref>). Since Müller would not have received CD’s <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4881.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter of 10 August [1865]</ref> when he wrote his own <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4881A.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">letter to CD on 12 August 1865</ref>, it appears that the possibility of <hi rend="italic">Anelasma</hi> as a connecting link occurred to each of them independently. When <hi rend="italic">Für Darwin</hi> (Müller 1864) was translated into English, some additional material was added, including Müller’s hypothesis on the relation of branched filaments to cement ducts and root-like tubes (see enclosure to <ref target="./DCP-LETT-6140.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Fritz Müller, 22 April 1868</ref>, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1163.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Calendar</hi></ref> no. 6140, and Dallas trans. 1869, pp. 135–40).</note>

In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 449, CD had argued that two groups of animals that passed through similar embryonic stages did so because they shared a common ancestor, and concluded: ‘community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent’. The problem Agassiz raised was the similarity in the larvae of sea urchins and brittle stars (Echinoids and Ophiurans). Agassiz pointed out that there was nothing in the adult forms to suggest any affinity and moreover that if they did share a common ancestor it was surprising that there were no connecting links in the fossil record, given that, with few exceptions, one would expect their skeletons to be well-preserved. Müller admitted in his reply (<ref target="" resp="#automat">letter from Fritz Müller to Alexander Agassiz, 29 June 1865</ref>, in Möller ed. 1915–21, 2: 64–7) that the case was a real difficulty for Darwinian theory (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8437.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Winsor 1976</ref>, pp. 152–4 and <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>, for a more detailed analysis of the case).</note>

In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 449, CD had referred to Agassiz’s belief that it was a law of nature that ‘ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of their descendants, —our existing species’. The existence of similar larval forms in apparently disparate adult genera was therefore no more explicable within Agassiz’s system based on ‘prophetic’ (embryonic) types (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8437.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Winsor 1976</ref>, pp. 146–8) than within a Darwinian one based on common descent.
