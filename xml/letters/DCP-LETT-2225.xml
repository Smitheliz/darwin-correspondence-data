<p>I sent the 3 vols of DC this morning— Keep them as long as you please.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Sinclair sailed a month ago duly crammed &amp; truly interested in the Bee &amp; Trefoil case of which he took notes—but by all means write him a note directed D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sinclair RN. Auckland New Zealand.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> it will please him as he goes out mainly to give a year up to collecting in Nat Hist &amp; is a steady going Enthusiast though unfortunately a very uneducated one. I wonder that you were not struck with the great Buckle—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I was—all of a heap.—&amp; quite echo your brothers opinion—that he is the damndest bore I ever met, &amp; what is more, the most obtrusive &amp; offensive one. I have ransacked my brains to remember his equal in vain—sure such an obnoxious dog will come to grief ere long.</p>
<p>As to my argument with him I felt doubled up altogether—the cool way in which he 3 times shifted his ground gave me the worst opinion of his unfairness &amp; when he said “Ah—well—perhaps we have different ideas of what the Inductive &amp; Deductive methods are”—I felt that I had got my belly-full &amp; sneaked away as I should from a treacherous savage, looking over my shoulder to see if he followed. Frances <hi rend="underline">hated</hi> him—cordially—as a woman can. This by no means interfered with our thorough enjoyment of the Wedgwoods party—but perhaps heightened it.</p>
<p>I had met the Farrers before at a small party &amp; was taken with Mr F. before I saw his Seraphic wife. (I think it is seraphims that sing).<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> <ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I will answer your query about big genera deliberately, in the affirmative &amp; give examples. I have been thinking a great deal on amount of variability in great &amp; small genera.—&amp; find it exceedingly difficult to explain logically the practical reasons there are against Botanists making varieties of <hi rend="underline">well marked</hi> species, ie. of small genera. Many of the small genera still kept up would never have been made at all, <anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>had the whole of the Natural Order as now known been known when those genera were made.<anchor xml:id="ann.a4" type="annotationEnd"/> EG. in Europe we have say 3 very different members of a large <hi rend="underline">unknown</hi> Asiatic group of plants containing 100 species: of these 3, as many genera are made in Europe: but after getting all the 100 Asiatic species, though these show that the said 3 genera are naught, we do not therefore cancel them—but in 9 cases out of 10 we group the Asiatic species as best we can under the 3 European genera— A thousand unphilosophical reasons occur, of considerable (<hi rend="underline">present</hi> practical) weight to cause us to keep up the said old genera—</p>
<p>We must never forget that Systematists have two very different ends to meet—</p> 
<figure type="diagram"> 
<p>to provide a ready nomenclature without which the science cannot advance, &amp; which we change as little as possible—&amp; further we use every means to avoid even a necessary change—so important is it for all to get up the nomenclature &amp; so bulky &amp; complicated is this nomenclature.</p>
<p>To arrange the members of the vegetable Kingdom scientifically <hi rend="underline">which is only done for the sake of scientific followers</hi></p> </figure> 
<p>Now we repeatedly find that to express our views scientifically we must break up the whole nomenclature, &amp; rather than do this excessively, we confine ourselves to stating our views without acting upon them</p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a5" type="annotationStart"/>In no respect do we sacrifice more to the utilitarian purpose of nomenclature, than in keeping up <hi rend="underline">small</hi> <hi rend="underline">bad</hi> <hi rend="underline">genera</hi>.<anchor xml:id="ann.a6" type="annotationEnd"/></p>
<p>Practically no one (except a few of us) hesitates to remove a very distinct species of an old genus, especially if its characters are constant, &amp; it is an <hi rend="underline">invariable plant</hi>, &amp; to make of it a new genus—just because it is more unlike its 20 neighbours than they are unlike one another— The probabilities in this case are that the 20 are varieties of 8 or 10, &amp; being variable have varieties made of themselves, whilst the 1 constant plant goes to a new genus—&amp; is a small genus with no varieties.</p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a7" type="annotationStart"/>Again, practically very few do up an old genus of one or a few well marked unvarying species especially if its generic name is a very familiar one.<anchor xml:id="ann.a8" type="annotationEnd"/> hence Amygdalus, Prunus, Cerasus—are kept up, though certainly not good genera in a scientific view of Rosaceæ. Few plants are more variable than Hawthorn—it is a small genus dismembered from Pyrus, but no British author makes varieties of it.</p>
<p>Genera in short are almost purely artificial as established in Botany.— some are <hi rend="underline">objective</hi> like <hi rend="underline">Salix</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Rosa</hi>, ie. every ignoramus recognizes them &amp; they are called natural genera—good genera—&amp;c &amp;c. others are <hi rend="underline">subjective</hi>, they require a special knowledge of the order to which they belong to know them—ignorami do not recognise them. Such are the genera of Grasses Cruciferæ Umbelliferæ &amp;c But between what the ignoramus does recognize &amp; does not there is no limit: &amp; the first-rate Botanist working upon a partial knowledge of a group is only in the position of an ignoramus after all—his two very distinct groups of an order are to him two genera; had he the whole species of the order he would never have recognized the groups at all, <hi rend="underline">as groups</hi>.</p>
