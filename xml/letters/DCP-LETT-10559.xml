<p>I have read your article with much interest, except the latter part, which soared above my ken.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am greatly pleased that you uphold my views to a certain extent. Your criticism of the rasping noise made by insects being necessarily rhythmical is very good; but though not made intentionally, it may be pleasing to the females, from the nerve cells being nearly similar in function throughout the animal kingdom.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> With respect to your letter, I believe that I understand your meaning, and agree with you.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I never supposed that the different degrees and kinds of pleasure derived from different music could be explained by the musical powers of our semi-human progenitors. Does not the fact that different people belonging to the same civilized nation are very differently affected by the same music, almost show that these diversities of taste and pleasure have been acquired during their individual lives? Your simile of architecture seems to me particularly good; for in this case the appreciation almost must be individual, though possibly the sense of sublimity excited by a grand cathedral may have some connection with the vague feelings of terror and superstition in our savage ancestors, when they entered a great cavern or gloomy forest.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I wish some one could analyse the feeling of sublimity. It amuses me to think how horrified some high-flying æsthetic men will be, at your encouraging such low degraded views as mine.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Believe me, yours very sincerely, | C<hi rend="smallCaps">harles</hi> D<hi rend="smallCaps">arwin</hi>.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The first part of Gurney’s article ‘On some disputed points in music’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9212.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gurney 1876</ref>) focused on the origins of music; it was followed by a discussion of technical aspects of rhythm, melody, and harmony, and the article finished with a discussion of the relation between music, language, aesthetics, and emotion.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Gurney had pointed out that the noises made by insects were naturally rhythmical owing to the way they were produced and compared these to the regular sound of a stick being run along a railing (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9212.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gurney 1876</ref>, p. 111).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Gurney’s letter has not been found.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9212.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gurney 1876</ref>, p. 118. Gurney had argued that to say a piece of music was composed as an expression of an external emotion was like saying that the interior of St Mark’s was designed as an expression of a previous mood of gloom in its architect.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD had suggested that musical tones and rhythm were used by half-human ancestors during courtship; he also suggested that musical sounds were one of the bases for the development of language (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1967.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 572). In his article, Gurney expressed general agreement with CD’s view of the development of music (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9212.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gurney 1876</ref>, pp. 107–8, 119; for more of CD’s theory, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1967.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, pp. 566–73).</note>
