<p>We are reading aloud on your recommendation Tylor &amp; are <hi rend="doubleUnderline">deeply</hi> interested by it: what a clever man— do you know who &amp; what he is?—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Have you read last no<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> of H. Spencers Biology:<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> very much like to hear what you think of it, especially about the umbellifers.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> When writing the Origin I consulted you &amp; you did not think that the compactness of the head accounted for the difference of the outer flowers; but then I do not think we took into account the difference between a globular &amp; flat corymb.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I am not satisfied by his views on irregular flowers; the peloric Gloxinia being upright seems a good argument; but then the peloric Snap dragon I find forms the same angle with the stem as does the very irregular common flower.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>The last number of the Nat. Hist review seems to me very good. That on H. Spencer I suppose is by Masters.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Let me have a short note from you whenever you can spare time.</p>
<p>All scientific work has been stopped with me for the last 2<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> months.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>

<p>I do hope Charles is making a little progress in spite of frequent returns of the sickness but there is a degree of vigour about him on the well days which makes me hope that his constitution is making a struggle. If he conquers this sickness I do hope you will be able to come &amp; see him before long &amp; I am sure there is nobody in the world he cares so much to see. He had one terribly bad week. We liked D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chapman so very much we were quite sorry the ice failed for his sake as well as ours.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>

Spencer’s list of subscribers included CD and Hooker (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7381.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Spencer 1904</ref>, 2: 484). CD’s instalments of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7369.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Spencer 1864–7</ref> are in the Darwin Library–CUL as a bound volume (see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi></ref> 1: 769–73).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The inflorescences of the Umbelliferae (also referred to as the Apiaciae in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4776.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Lindley 1853</ref>) are discussed in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7369.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Spencer 1864–7</ref>, 2: 156–7.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">No correspondence between CD and Hooker on this subject has been found; however, in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 145, CD wrote, ‘in the case of the corolla of the Umbelliferae, it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs me, in species with the densest heads that the inner and outer flowers most frequently differ’. He prefaced this by stating (p. 144): <quote type="quote"> I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of correlation in modifying important structures, independently of utility and, therefore, of natural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants. </quote> <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7369.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Spencer 1864–7</ref>, 2: 156–7, gives several examples of Umbelliferae species, some with flat inflorescences and differently shaped inner and outer flowers (when the flowers are crowded together), and others with globular inflorescences that do not have differently shaped flowers. Moreover, he argues that in species where the umbellules themselves are clustered, the tendency towards greater irregularity of outer flowers is increased as one moves to the periphery of the cluster. Spencer thus attempts to show that a causal relationship exists between the shape of the inflorescence and the shape of individual flowers within it and concludes (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 157): <quote type="quote"> Considering how obviously these various forms are related to the various conditions, we should be scarcely able, even in the absence of all other facts, to resist the conclusion that the differences in the conditions are the causes of the differences in the forms. </quote> The above passage was scored by CD in his copy of part 14. He also wrote on the back cover, ‘Hooker disagrees about Umbellifers’ (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi></ref> 1: 770). CD’s statements in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> were not substantially changed in later editions.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Spencer suggested that the shape of the flower of <hi rend="italic">Gloxinia erecta</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Sinningia speciosa</hi>, Brazilian gloxinia) was related to the angle it formed relative to the stem. The peloric regular flower, which was radially symmetrical, was associated with an upright attitude, while the normal irregular flower, which was bilaterally symmetrical, inclined at an acute angle from the stem (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7369.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Spencer 1864–7</ref>, 2: 151–2). CD had kept Hooker informed about his recent crossing experiments on peloric and common <hi rend="italic">Antirrhinum majus</hi> as well as sending him flower specimens (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4846.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D.

            <note xml:id="foot.f10">CD refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3217.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Maxwell Tylden Masters</ref>. The article on Spencer’s <hi rend="italic">Principles of biology</hi> in the issue of <hi rend="italic">Natural History Review</hi> for July 1865, pp. 373–85, was unsigned. The review focused on aspects of plant teratology, a subject that Masters had studied extensively (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5297.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Masters 1869</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4766.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">letter from M. T. Masters, 7 February 1865)</ref>.
