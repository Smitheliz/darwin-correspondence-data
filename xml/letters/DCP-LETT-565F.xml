I should feel much obliged if you would answer me this question, &amp; at the same time perhaps you will be good enough to inform me, whether any more facts have been discovered, &amp; whether your views on the origin of the terraces round the summit of the Eildons have been confirmed, or the contrary?—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I should much like to know by what means you have estimated the height of the terraces above the sea, and their corresponding level on the different hills?<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Over how <hi rend="underline">many miles</hi> of country have traces of these marks at the same level been observed? Should you feel so inclined, any observations on th〈is〉 subject, which you would have the kindness to communicate with me, I should receive with the greatest interest.— I had intended to have visited your part of Scotland this summer, but the state of my health renders it very doubtful, whether I shall be able. I should have much enjoy〈ed〉</p>
