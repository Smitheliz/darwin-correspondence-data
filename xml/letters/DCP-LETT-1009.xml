                <div type="transcription">
<p>I have taken a most ungrateful length of time in thanking you for your very kind present of your Observations.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But I happened to have had in hand several other books &amp; have finished yours only a few days ago. I found it very pleasant reading &amp; many of your facts interested me much: I think I was more interested, which is odd, with your notes on some of the lower animals than on the higher ones. The introduction struck me as very good; but this is what I expected, for I well remember being quite delighted with a preliminary essay to the first number of the Annals of N. History.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I missed one discussion, &amp; think myself illused, for I remember your saying you would make some remarks on the weather &amp; Barometer,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> as a guide for the ignorant in prediction. I had, also, hoped to have perhaps met with some remarks on the amount of variation in our common species: Andrew Smith once declared he would get some hundreds of specimens of larks &amp; sparrows from all parts of Great Britain &amp; see whether with finest measurements he c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> detect any propor-tional variations in beaks or limbs &amp;c. This point interests me from having lately been skimming over the absurdly opposite conclusions of Glöger<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; Brehm;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> the one making half-a dozen species out of every common bird &amp; the other turning so many reputed species into one. Have you ever done anything of this kind; or have you ever studied Gloger’s or Brehm’s works?<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I was interested by your account of the Martins, for I had just before been utterly perplexed by noticing just such a proceeding as you describe; I counted seven one day lately visiting a single nest &amp; sticking dirt on the adjoining wall.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I may mention that I once saw some squirrels eagerly splitting those little semi-transparent spherical galls on the back of oak-leaves, for the maggot within; so that they are insectivorous.— A Cychrus rostratus once squirted into my eye &amp; gave me extreme pain; &amp; I must tell you what happened to me on the banks of the Cam in my early entomological days; under a piece of bark I found two carabi (I forget which) &amp; caught one in each hand, when lo &amp; behold I saw a sacred Panagæus crux major; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, &amp; to lose Panagæus was out of the question, so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust &amp; pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat &amp; I lost both Carabi &amp; Panagæus!<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I was quite astonished to hear of a terrestrial Planaria; for a year or two ago I described in the Annals of N. H. several beautifully coloured terrestrial species of the S. hemisphere, &amp; thought it quite a new fact.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> By the way you speak of a sheep with a broken leg not having flukes: I have heard my Father aver that a fever or any <hi rend="underline">serious accident</hi>, as broken limb will cause in a man all the intestinal worms to be evacuated; might not this possibly have been the case with the flukes in their early state.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I hope you were none the worse for Southampton; I wish I had seen you looking rather fatter: I enjoyed my week extremely &amp; it did me good. I missed you the few last days &amp; we never managed to see much of each other; but there were so many people there, that I for one hardly saw anything of any one.—</p>
<p>Once again thank you very cordially for your kind present &amp; the pleasure it has given me, &amp; believe me | Ever most truly yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I have quite forgotten to say how greatly interested I was with your discussion on the statistics of animals: when will Nat: Hist: be so perfect that such points, as you discuss, will be perfectly known about any one animal!<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
