                <div type="transcription">
<p>I have just finished your little Book<ref target="#foot.f2"/> with great interest.</p>
<p>Your description of the Snowdonian Glaciers<ref target="#foot.f3"/> is most vivid &amp; how it does make me long to wander once again over mountains, which I suppose I shall never be able to do.— But the object of my writing is to beg you to take the trouble to inform me on what authority you state that Drift lies on plains of Siberia &amp; penetrates the valleys of the Altai.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I had thought there were no erratic boulders in Siberia. Who describes the drift, &amp; where? Will you kindly inform me as this point greatly interests me.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Your view of the Lakes in Wales from Glacial action is quite new to me.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Dear Ramsay | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I wish to Heaven you would sometime examine Glen Roy &amp; settle origin of parallel Roads; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. die easier, if I knew what was the right view, whether I be quite wrong or right.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> You have paid me a <hi rend="underline">superb</hi> compliment about glacial action in N. Wales!<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I look back to that little tour with profound interest. I saw facing Capel Curig<ref target="#foot.f9"/> some fine cases of erratic boulders on <hi rend="underline">ledges</hi> on side of mountain, which, I think, is more remarkable than even the perched boulders.</p>
<p>P.S. | Now that I am writing will you let me ask you one more question.</p>
<p>Is it certain that traces of organic remains have been found in the Longmynd Beds?<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>And secondly is it (as I suppose) certain that these Beds are lower than Barrande’s primodial zone?<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I have heard the traces of remains in the Longmynd beds so doubted &amp; disputed that I cannot remember what is the final conclusion.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The second part of Ramsay’s text described his geological fieldwork in Snowdonia, North Wales, and the evidence for extensive former ice-action in the region.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Ramsay 1859, pp. 451–2. The passage is marked in CD’s reprint (Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">When Ramsay republished this essay as a book (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6520.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ramsay 1860</ref>), he added the information requested by CD in a note. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6520.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ramsay 1860</ref>, pp. 90–1.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Ramsay 1859, p. 459. Ramsay proposed that the Welsh lake basins were ground out by a heavy load of ice. When the glacier retreated the hollow became filled with the water drainage of the valley.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">In his paper on the parallel roads of Glen Roy (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 1: 89–137), CD argued that the ‘roads’ along the sides of the valley were old beaches formed by sea and wave action during a former period of submersion. For CD’s defence of this interpretation, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vols. 2 and 3, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6779.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Rudwick 1974</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Ramsay stated that CD’s work on the action of ice in Llyn Idwal, published in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_154.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Notes on the effects produced by the ancient glaciers of Caernarvonshire’</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Collected</hi> <hi rend="italic">papers</hi> 1: 163–71), was the first ‘classic’ study of the area. See Ramsay 1859, p. 448. Ramsay’s interpretation of glacial phenomena was similar to that proposed by both CD and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref>: he held that glaciers and floating ice scratched and scoured the rocks when the land was formerly submerged.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">CD spent a night at an inn at Capel Curig during a geological expedition in June 1842 to examine glacial action in North Wales. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 2, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-632.xml">letter to W. H. Fitton, 23 June 1842</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">The Longmynd beds in Shropshire were identified as belonging to the Lower Cambrian. For Ramsay’s reply, see the following letter. For the significance of the discovery of organic remains in the Longmynd, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7064.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Secord 1986</ref>, pp. 281–6.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_291.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joachim Barrande</ref> had given the name ‘primordial’ to a fossiliferous deposit near Prague that lay under Silurian rocks.</note>
