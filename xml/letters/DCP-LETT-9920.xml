<p>You are quite right in believing that I never had any intention to slight M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ffinden; nor have I slighted him.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>When I wrote to the Privy Council I had never heard of the rule that School Boards should correspond solely through the Chairman; but I cannot believe that a parishioner may not independently ask a question with respect to a subject not as yet brought before a School Board, or a voluntary Committee, as in our case.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Had this been the rule, I should either have received a reprimand or been answered through the Chairman.</p>
<p>The affair about the repairs is simply ridiculous. I sent a message to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Town, asking him to complete the repairs as soon as possible, that the room might be used, and was told that they would cost £5.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I assumed, but without making any enquiry, that this higher estimate had been agreed on, and when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. T. sent me his bill for £5, I told him to apply to the School Committee. After a considerable interval he informed me that only £4 had been paid; and then I learnt, for the first time, that I had ordered repairs beyond the agreement, and of course immediately paid the extra £1 myself.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> This happened several weeks ago.</p>
<p>It is very good of you to endeavour to restore peace in the village, and you are at full liberty to say that I had never any intention of showing any disrespect to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ffinden; but I cannot apologise, for I do not think any apology is due on my part.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ffinden accused me in the vestry of having made false statements, and when asked what they were, answered that I said that the Schoolroom had been previously lent as a Reading Room for one year less than had really occurred: so that I merely understated my grounds for repeating the request. On the following day he wrote officially to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin, and again affirmed that I had made several mistatements.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> This is conduct which a man does not commonly pass over without some sort of apology.— Nevertheless if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ffinden bows to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin or myself we will return it; but I fear under present circumstances that we can take no further step.</p>
<p>I have troubled you with a very long letter on this paltry affair. | My dear Sir John | Yours sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
