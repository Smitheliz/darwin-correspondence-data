<p>I hardly know what to thank for first. Your stamps gave infinite satisfaction. I took him first one lot &amp; then an hour afterwards another lot.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He actually raised himself on one elbow to look at them. It was the first animation he showed. He said only “You must thank Prof. Gray awfully”.— In evening after long silence, there came out the oracluar sentence “He is awfully kind”. And indeed you are; overworked as you are, to take so much trouble for our poor dear little man.—</p>
<p>And now I must begin the “awfullys” on my own account: what a capital notice you have published on the orchids!<ref target="#foot.f3"/> it could not have been better; but I fear that you overrate it. I am very sure that I had not the least idea that you or anyone would approve of it so much.— I return your last note<ref target="#foot.f4"/> for chance of your publishing any notice on subject; but after all perhaps you may not think it worth while; yet in my judgment <hi rend="underline">several</hi> of your facts, especially P. hyperborea are <hi rend="underline">much</hi> too good to be merged in a Review.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> But I have always noticed that you are prodigal in originality in your Reviews.— I wish with all my heart I could understand use of the common vibratile labellum in foreign orchids;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> insects would have to watched at work.—</p>
<p>You speak of two Pogonias always growing together;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> see my account of Aropera, a <hi rend="underline">male</hi> orchid.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Cannot you get a pupil to watch Calopogon? I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very much surprised if insect suck stigma: the speculation crossed my mind &amp; was rejected from want of any analogous case.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I received two copies of your Review; so I sent one to Hooker,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> as if you have not sent it, he would surely like to see your excellent remarks.— You exactly express my conclusion about Greenland. Hooker, I think, underrates occasional means of transport.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Till I proved the contrary, he used to maintain vehemently without a fact that the sea would kill all seeds.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have not had time yet to look at Mitchellia.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Cannot you persuade your pupil to protect under fine net &amp; experiment on some plants.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Perhaps Houstonia is visited by moths:<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I have reason to <hi rend="underline">suspect</hi> that many Galiaceæ are so visited.</p>
<p>I was looking at Lythrum salicaria this morning; it is beautifully dimorphic like Primula, but with addition in both forms (I believe there is a third form) of six short stamens: it will be curious to make out use of them.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>But I must hold hard, otherwise I shall spend my life over dimorphism: what I said about pollens &amp; stigmas of Linum grandiflorum, knowing each other is confirmed by further experiment.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>I have written to Trübner about the copies of Orchid Book.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>Farewell. This is a dull letter &amp; is sent merely to give you my most cordial thanks.— Adios | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f11">The reference is to Gray’s review of Hooker’s paper on the distribution of Arctic plants (J. D. Hooker 1861a), which followed Gray’s review of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref> (A. Gray 1862a) in the July issue of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Science and Arts.</hi> In his paper, Hooker sought to explain the general paucity of the Greenland flora on the hypothesis that ‘the polar region was once occupied by the Scandinavian flora’, and that the cold of the glacial epoch drove the vegetation southwards, causing the temperate flora of southern Greenland to be ‘driven into the sea’. Following ‘the return of the heat’, Hooker argued, Greenland would have been repopulated by the migration of Arctic species surviving in the south of the peninsula (J. D. Hooker 1862a, p. 254). On reading Hooker’s paper, CD concluded that ‘during the coldest part of Glacial period, Greenland must have been quite depopulated’, suggesting that it must then have been repopulated by ‘accidental means of transport by ice &amp; currents’ (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3458.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 25 February [1862]</ref>; see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3465.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, 3 March 1862</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3468.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 7 March [1862]</ref>). In his review (A. Gray 1862d, p. 145), Gray reported Hooker’s hypothesis, but stated: <quote type="quote"> Considering the present frigid climate of Greenland, … its moderate summer and low autumnal temperature, we should rather have supposed the complete extermination of the Greenland ante-glacial flora; and have referred the Scandinavian character of the existing flora … directly to subsequent immigration from the eastern continent. </quote> See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3795.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 4 November [1862]</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12">Starting in March 1855, partly prompted by Hooker’s scepticism on the subject, CD had carried out a series of experiments to ascertain the fertility of seeds after immersion in salt water (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 5, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1661.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 7 April [1855]</ref>).</note>
