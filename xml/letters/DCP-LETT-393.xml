<p>I have been shamefully idle in not having written to you some weeks since. But <hi rend="underline">you</hi> can make allowance for indolence in this particular line:—why writing a letter should require a greater stock of energy, than almost any other act during the whole week, I know not, but so it is with me.— I had a very prosperous journey after leaving you at the inn at Portsmouth, although I did not see so much of the country as in coming down.— Is there any chance of your coming up: if you do, you ought to bring that lower jaw.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I made Lyell open his eyes at hearing about it. What a shame and pity it was, that the quarry was closed.—</p>
<p>Since being in town Henslow has been up about some London University business,—he is one of the Senators.— He enquired much after you.— I saw also little Albert Way, who expressed great delight at seeing a South American Brachinus; which brought back to his mind the famous old expedition to Whittlesea Meer.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Way’s chief occupation is hunting out old engraved brass-plates in churches, &amp; poring over antiquities in the British Museum.—</p>
<p>I am sure you will be sorry to hear a piece of bad news, with respect to the Wedgwoods. Hensleigh W. who married Fanny Mackintosh (&amp; who is the pleasantest of the whole family) has long had great scruples, about the profanation of taking oaths on <hi rend="underline">trifling occasions.</hi> A week since it 〈    〉 for him to swear <hi rend="underline">42</hi> oaths(!) under the new reign to qualify as magistrate.— this he could not bring himself to do, &amp; consequently resigned his place of 800£ per annum &amp; is now utterly thrown out of all employment.— He has three children &amp; may probably have many more, &amp; has scarcely anything to live on.— It is a most distressing case: many thousand people might be searched &amp; not so excellent, clever &amp; admirable a pair could be found as H. &amp; his wife.—and now they are actually thinking of going to <hi rend="underline">America</hi>!—thoug〈h〉 I cannot but hope that something may turn up.—</p>
<p>I hope before very long, you will summon up some of the energy, which I say is so difficult to do, &amp; write to me &amp; tell me how you are all going on.— Though most certainly this letter deserves no return.— I am very glad I paid you that flying visit, hurried as it was, for I like being able to form a picture in my mind of the place, whence a letter comes.—</p>
<p>Good bye, my dear Fox | 〈    〉 〈mo〉st sincerely, | Chas. Darwin.—</p>
<p>Pray remember me most kindly to all your family.—</p>
<p>T. Eyton is in town, preparing a great book, a monograph on Ducks of the World.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> with drawing of skeleton of each genus.— Eyton will make a first rate naturalist, some day, I think.—and it is a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">shame</hi> that you are not so <hi rend="doubleUnderline">now</hi>. recollect that Sir—</p>
