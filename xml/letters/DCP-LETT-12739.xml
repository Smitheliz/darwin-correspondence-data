<p>Your note followed us on our travels where, inter alia, we had been seeing Silchester, and talked there of you &amp; “worms”—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Now for your questions.</p>
<p>1. The concrete floor is not protected or dry. It has perished much with wet &amp; frost, &amp; is also in parts grown over with moss &amp; grass &amp; weeds. This morning we have had such heavy rain that the worm casts are much washed away. But I will look at it the first calm rainless morning and tell you about the worms. I have little doubt that they are at work there &amp; think I trace them this morning.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>2. I send you Mr Wrights article with plan— also a plan I made myself.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>3 All our walks near the house are underlaid with some 6 inches of brick rubbish: and some of them are now on still mornings covered with worm casts; to my gardening feelings, a great nuisance, for they spoil the gravel surface. This morning the rain has washed them into indistinguishable lumps—but you shall have some worm casts on the first favourable day.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Under the fir trees the fallen leaves wash into the holes making a little crown of spines.</p>
<p>4. As to Torbitt— the address is</p> 
<figure type="diagram"> 
<p>James Caird Esq C.B</p>
<p>Inclosure Comm<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Office</p>
<p>St James Square.</p> </figure> 
                    <p>I was very sorry that Torbitts case did not come before the recent Irish Committee on Potatoes—but I did not know there was such a Committee till it was over, or I would have suggested their calling him—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> He will I trust advertize his potatoes. Put a price on a thing—says Sir W Thompson and you make people think it worth notice.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>We found here a rather better account of “Aunt Eliz”: but we can scarcely look for a much better one.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Effie &amp; I have had a charming little excursion to our friends the Maskelynes in Wiltshire—driving back with our own horses &amp; seeing Abury &amp; many other remains.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> They are very curious—but still more curious is the infinite quantity written and the infinitesimal quantity known about them</p>
<p>Very sincerely yours | T H Farrer</p>
<p>Ida &amp; Horace we hear are busy furnishing. It is delightful to see her turned into a “Martha” &amp; cumbered with much serving<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12732.xml">letter to T. H. Farrer, 1 October 1880</ref>. Silchester in Hampshire was the site of a Roman town; it was first excavated by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2617.xml">James Gerald Joyce</ref> between 1864 and 1878. CD was interested in earthworm activity at the site of a Roman villa found on Farrer’s estate at Abinger, Surrey.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD’s questions were listed in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12732.xml">letter to T. H. Farrer, 1 October 1880</ref>. CD wondered whether the floor of the Roman villa found on Farrer’s estate had been protected since its excavation in August 1877.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">An account of the excavation at Abinger, with a plan, was published in the <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi>, 5 January 1878, pp. 19–20. It was not by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8854.xml">George Robert Nicol Wright</ref>, but mentioned the paper he had presented at a meeting of the British Archaeological Association. Farrer’s plan is possibly that in DAR 64.2: 38.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD had asked for wormcasts from these walks to see whether the small fragments of stone swallowed by worms acted like millstones to grind their food (<ref target="./DCP-LETT-12732.xml">letter to T. H. Farrer, 1 October 1880</ref> and n. 5).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD had enlisted Farrer‘s help in raising funds for <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4777.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">James Torbitt</ref>, who was attempting to breed blight-resistant potatoes (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12522.xml">letter from T. H. Farrer, 6 March 1880</ref> and n. 1). Bad weather in 1879 depressed Irish potato yields and many Irish farmers and labourers were facing destitution; in May 1880, a parliamentary select committee had been formed to investigate how best to produce disease-resistant varieties. Torbitt’s work was not considered by the committee (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9034.xml">DeArce 2008</ref>, pp. 216–17).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4737.xml">William Thomson</ref>. Torbitt had advertised in 1876 although CD had discouraged him (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 24, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10463.xml">letter to James Torbitt, 21 April 1876</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10466.xml">letter from James Torbitt, 22 April 1876</ref>). Torbitt advertised again in the 1890s, well after CD’s death (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9034.xml">DeArce 2008</ref>, pp. 217–18).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5039.xml">Elizabeth Wedgwood</ref> was seriously ill; Farrer was married to her niece.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">Farrer and his wife, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5028.xml">Katherine Euphemia (Effie) Farrer</ref>, were visiting <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4580.xml">Thereza Mary</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4579.xml">Nevil Story-Maskelyne</ref>. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4579.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Nevil Story-Maskelyne</ref> had inherited Basset Down House, near Wroughton, Wiltshire, in 1879 (<hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>). Abury was an alternative name for Avebury, a Neolithic site in Wiltshire with three stone circles; from the seventeenth century various ideas had been proposed about their origin and use (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11113.xml">Ucko <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> 1991</ref>). In 1871, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3026.xml">John Lubbock</ref> had purchased part of the Avebury site to prevent destruction of the stone circle (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., p. 257).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1227.xml">Ida</ref> (Farrer’s daughter by his first wife) and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1226.xml">Horace Darwin</ref> were settling into their new house at 66 Hills Road, Cambridge. Martha: a reference to Luke 10:38–42.
