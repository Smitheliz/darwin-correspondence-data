<p>Prof. Balfour has just offered me a situation in India;<ref target="#foot.f1"/> regarding which I would very much like to have your advice. Before stating particulars in regard to this, however, I will now,—from the kind interest you have expressed in my behalf—state that I have not at all a pleasant situation under M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>.Nab here.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I formerly used to regard him, as, indeed, a friend, now however, I plainly see that he is doing as much as he rightly can to place obstacles in the way to my advancement. In illustration of this I may state the following. He ought to have allowed me to attend the Botanical Classes this season which he has not. Now; the time it is in, is only an hour daily, and there is not a single thing, in regard to my duties, which he could mention, to prevent my attendance.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> There is this, however, he knows that I am interested in the place; engaged in numerous experiments which will induce me to submit to him, otherwise, I feel assured he would not have treated me thus, simply because I am of <hi rend="underline">service</hi> to him, and might put him to a little inconvenience by leaving him. This and other little acts which I could mention if it were worth while, plainly show me his feelings towards me. I would much rather that I had not to mention these; but the kind interest you have manifested towards me has induced me to state a few particulars regarding my present situation. And I sincerely trust you will excuse me for so doing.</p>
<p>In respect to the Indian situation Prof. Balfour has given me the following information. Dr Anderson of Calcutta has written him that a few of his friends are desirous to get an intelligent young man to take charge of a Chinchona nursery, which they intend forming at Darjiling.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> They purpose giving £.100 the first year and £.120 for the three subsequent years—as they wish to have an engagement of 4 years. On finding that, if I accepted it, I should have to leave here in latter end of August or beginning of September, I told Prof. Balfour that being engaged with a variety of very interesting experiments, I really could not think of entering into any such engagement this season: being anxious to get results.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> He, however, remarked that I should think a little more over it before giving up what he thinks is a nice opening: he also said—for I suppose he understands that a number of my experiments have been proposed by you<ref target="#foot.f6"/>—that I might be of greater service to you in that respect in the above place, and advised me to write you and mention the offer he had made.</p>
<p>I will therefore be greatly obliged if you will kindly favour me with your advice, for I do not know well what to do. In respect to the place itself, I really think it offers no great encouragement, the engagement is certainly long for the remuneration offered, more especially upon such an important product.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> All things considered, I have certainly a strong inclination to give it up, even though by so doing, I should give a little offence to the Professor. Might I in the event of so doing take advantage of your kind offer in last letter,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> and ask you if you could in anyway aid me in getting some foreign or colonial appointment. I should certainly regard it as a great favour</p>
<p>In the meantime | I remain | Sir | Yours very respectfully | J. Scott</p>

These experiments were intended to throw light on three common problems: the relative fertility of crosses between individuals of the same and of different species; the relative fertility of crosses between different varieties of the same species; and the relative fertility of homomorphic and heteromorphic crosses in the same species. In a set of related experiments, Scott also attempted to make bi-generic crosses (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3904.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 6 January 1863</ref> and n. 10).</note>
