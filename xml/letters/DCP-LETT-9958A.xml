                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>The day before yesterday D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> L. Playfair called upon me. He entirely approves of the Bill &amp; is quite prepared to introduce it, in case that should seem to be the best course. Yesterday he was to see L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Cardwell and to show it to him. I feel sanguine in hoping that L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Cardwell will be induced to adopt it for this reason.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colam, the Secretary of the S. for the P. of C. to A. called on me yesterday and developed to me their scheme. It appears to be substantially the same as ours (certainly not more restrictive)   They (the Society) regard it as Lord Cardwells he having approved of it.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Consequently I think there is good reason to hope that a compromise will be effected. As soon as it is effected it would I think be well that it should be known as generally as possible that such a measure has the support of our side.</p>
<p>L. Playfair seems to think that if L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Cardwell adopts this Bill or one which we can approve of, it <hi rend="underline">could</hi> be passed this session</p>
<p>I have also seen Sir J. Paget<ref target="#foot.f4"/> who has been in personal communication with L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Cardwell &amp; says that he desires to meet the wishes of scientific men on this subject &amp; to act in such a way as to secure their cooperation</p>
<p>I think it very satisfactory that the Society for the prevention are willing to cooperate with us</p>
<p>Yours very truly | J B Sanderson</p>
