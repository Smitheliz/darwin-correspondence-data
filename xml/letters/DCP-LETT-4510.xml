                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I am so much better that I have just finished paper for Linn. Soc;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but as I am not yet at all strong I felt much disinclination to write &amp; therefore you must forgive me for not having sooner thanked you for your paper on man received on the 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But first let me say that I have hardly ever in my life been more struck by any paper than that on Variation &amp;c &amp;c in the Reader.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I feel sure that such papers will do more for the spreading of our views on the modification of species than any separate Treatises on the simple subject itself. It is really admirable; but you ought not in the Man paper to speak of the theory as mine; it is just as much yours as mine.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> One correspondent has already noticed to me your “high-minded” conduct on this head.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>But now for your Man paper, about which I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to write more than I can. The great leading idea is quite new to me, viz that during late ages the mind will have been modified more than the body;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> yet I had got as far as to see with you that the struggle between the races of man depended entirely on intellectual &amp; <hi rend="underline">moral</hi> qualities.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>The latter part of paper I can designate only as grand &amp; most eloquently done.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have shown your paper to 2 or 3 persons who have been here<ref target="#foot.f10"/> &amp; they have been equally struck with it.— I am not sure that I go with you on all minor points:<ref target="#foot.f11"/> when reading Sir G. Greys account of constant battles of Australian savages, I rember thinking that N. Selection would come in,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; likewise with Esquimaux with whom the art of fishing &amp; managing canoe is said to be hereditary.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I rather differ on the rank under classificatory point of view which you assign to man: I do not think any character simply in excess ought ever to be used for the higher divisions.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Ants would not be separated from other Hymenopterous insects however high the instinct of the one &amp; however low the instincts of the other.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>With respect to the differences of race, a conjecture has occurred to me that much may be due to the correlation of complexion (&amp; consequently Hair) with constitution. Assume that a dusky individual best escaped miasma &amp; you will readily see what I mean:<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I persuaded the Director Gen. of the Med. depart. of the army to send printed forms to the surgeons of all Regiments in Tropical countries to ascertain this point, but I dare say I shall never get any returns.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> Secondly I suspect that a sort of sexual selection has been the most powerful means of changing the races of man. I can shew that the diff<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> races have a widely diff<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> standard of beauty. Among savages the most powerful men will have the pick of the women &amp; they will generally leave the most descendants.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>I have collected a few notes on man but I do not suppose I shall ever use them. Do you intend to follow out your views, &amp; if so would you like at some future time to have my few references &amp; notes? I am sure I hardly know whether they are of any value &amp; they are at present in a state of chaos. There is much more that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to write but I have not strength<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>Believe me dear Wallace | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>Our aristocracy is handsomer (more hideous according to a Chinese or Negro) than middle classes from pick of women; but oh what a scheme is primogeniture for destroying N. Selection.—<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>I fear my letter will be barely intelligible to you—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f8">On a page of Wallace 1864b heavily annotated by CD (p. clxii; p. 5 in CD’s offprint copy in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL) Wallace noted the increasing influence of natural selection on mental and moral qualities, including a ‘capacity for acting in concert’, sympathy, a sense of right, a decrease in combativeness, self-restraint, and intelligent foresight. He stated that ‘tribes in which such mental and moral qualities were predominant, would therefore have an advantage in the struggle for existence over other tribes in which they were less developed’. The page on which Wallace applied this principle to existing races is also heavily annotated by CD (see Wallace 1864b, p. clxv; p. 8 in CD’s offprint copy).

            <note xml:id="foot.f9">CD may refer in part to the last two pages of the paper (Wallace 1864b, pp. clxix–clxx), which included what the editors of the <hi rend="italic">Natural History Review</hi> called the ‘somewhat utopian reflections Mr. Wallace indulges in’ regarding the future of humankind (see Wallace 1864c, p. 328); Wallace predicted a world where human behaviour and interactions would be perfected, with no need for government. However, CD did not annotate those pages; he did write favourable remarks in the margins of the two preceding pages, where Wallace summarised his overall argument (Wallace 1864b, pp. clxvii–clxviii; pp. 10–11 in CD’s offprint).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Since 11 May 1864, when CD received the offprint of Wallace 1864b, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242) recorded visits from Sarah Elizabeth Wedgwood, and from CD’s sons George Howard, Francis, and Leonard from their school, as well as a medical consultation with <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2555.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Jenner</ref>; CD’s son William Erasmus also arrived on 28 May 1864. CD’s daughters Henrietta Emma and Elizabeth were at home during most of this time.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f12">CD scored and underlined a passage in Wallace 1864b (pp. clxiii–clxiv; pp. 6–7 in his offprint) that stated that when sympathetic feelings and intellectual faculties had developed adequately, humans would no longer be influenced by natural selection in their physical form and structure: ‘as an animal he would remain almost stationary’.

            <note xml:id="foot.f16">Wallace attributed the derivation of external racial characteristics to the principle of correlation of growth that CD described in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 11–12 and 143–50. CD had noted that when one part of an organism changed, another part often changed at the same time, and Wallace believed that as early humans dispersed to distinct environments, the natural selection of useful variations in internal constitution was accompanied by external changes (Wallace 1864b, pp. clxi and clxv–clxvi). In his offprint of Wallace 1864b, CD wrote in the margins near Wallace’s discussion: ‘He attributes all these [external physical changes of humans] to correlation with useful changes’; and, ‘I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> attribute more to direct action of physical conditions’ (see CD’s offprint of Wallace 1864b, p. 9).
