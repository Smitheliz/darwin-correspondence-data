<p>Your courteous reply to my former letter leads me to send you a little paper I recently published. The preservative method mentioned you may find very possibly of use.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The addition of a little Glycerine say 10% or thereabouts I find improves it somewhat. I have some pus &amp; urine now on my table preserved for over 3 months   For urine a very little Carbolic Acid is best if the preservation to be for any length of time otherwise there is a growth of torula.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> For some hitherto unmanageable invertebrates I suspect it may be of great use especially as the Microscopical characters even of glandular epithelium is unaltered.</p>
<p>While writing permit me to ask whether your attention has been called to the bearing of circumcision on your doctrines. It is I presume about the most marked methodical &amp; persistent mutilation of which there is any historical record either in the human species or the lower animals. Yet, practised for not far from 3000 years, so far as I know it has left not a trace of its effect in the male children of the present day. I have not had any special opportunity to observe it but I have good reason to suppose that the prepuce of the Jews of today is of the ordinary size. Indeed the Continuance of the rite itself is a proof that it is at least not a rudimentary organ. So far as it goes it seems to me to be a fair historical argument against your views. I only suggest it &amp; with your habitual fairness—a fairness so unusual in the founder of a new doctrine &amp; so much the more to be admired—I know you will give it due weight<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
