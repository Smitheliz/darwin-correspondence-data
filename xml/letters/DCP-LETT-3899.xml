<p>A happy new year to you—and many happy returns of the season to you and yours!</p>
<p>I ought long ago to have replied to your query about cases of <hi rend="underline">dimorphism</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I wanted to overhaul my notes—and see if they contained any thing worth sending to you. But I have found nothing sufficiently precise to bear upon the case. There is a large showy species of Linum, <hi rend="underline">L. trigynum</hi>, common in India—with large yellow flowers—which is very variable in the number of the styles—and if my recollection is right—in their development also.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> You could easily get the plant through Hooker<ref target="#foot.f4"/>—and it would not trouble you much to rear it, as it flowers with Green House heat. I have a notion that it might yield you something in your line worth observing.</p>
<p>Nor can I give you a more satisfactory reply, to your query, about ‘sporting buds’<ref target="#foot.f5"/>   I have no case, that I can bring to mind.</p>
<p>I was sorry to hear from your brother, of the efflorescence which has been troubling you—and which he tells me is one of the reasons, that has prevented you from coming to town.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> You were never more missed—at any rate by me—for there has been this grand <hi rend="underline">Darwinian</hi> case of the <hi rend="underline">Archæopteryx</hi> for you and me to have a long jaw about. Had the Solenhofen quarries been commissioned—by august command—to turn out a strange being ‘a la Darwin—it could not have executed the behest more handsomely—than in the <hi rend="underline">Archæopteryx</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> This is sober earnest—and that you should not have been in to town—and see it and talk over it with me, is a criminal proceeding. You are not to put your faith in the slip-shod and hasty account of it given to the Royal Society.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> It is a much more astounding creature—than has entered into the the conception of the describer—who compares it with the Raptores &amp; Passeres. &amp; Gallinaceæ, as a round winged (like the last) ‘Bird of flight.’<ref target="#foot.f9"/> It actually had at least two long free digits to the fore limb—and those digits bearing claws as long and strong as those on the hind leg. Couple this with the long tail—and other odd things,—which I reserve for a jaw—and you will have the sort of misbegotten-bird-creature—the dawn of an oncoming conception ‘a la Darwin.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> But I will not say more about it till you show yourself in town. A ludicrous event has turned up. John Evans appears to have hit upon the very obvious cast of the interior of the skull—undetected by the describer, and before Owen’s paper is out, we have M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Mackie describing the hemispheres—and optic lobes of Archæopteryx! Look at the Geologist.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>The Germans generally have a spite at Darwinianism. It killed poor Wagner. but on his death-bed, he took consolation in denouncing it as a <hi rend="underline">phantasia</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Even Von Martius<ref target="#foot.f13"/> has a shot at you. I send the paper containing it—being a sort of éloge upon Wagner.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Kindly return it when done with.</p>
<p>You will have seen my elephant paper out in the Nat Hist. Review<ref target="#foot.f15"/>—with some of the evidence given which you thought to be wanting in what I sent you. I have not altered the latter, but I have gone into the value of the American measure of variety—and some other points.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>Lyell is hard at work in finishing his book.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> I fancy he has had much to alter and adjust—and I have got a quagmire-<hi rend="underline">ish</hi> kind of feeling, that he—and the Subject Homo—will be bogged in it—alike.</p>
<p>My Dear Darwin | Yours very Sin<hi rend="superscript">ly</hi> | H Falconer</p>

Owen compared <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> with pterodactyls and birds, concluding that: ‘The best-determinable parts of its preserved structure declare it unequivocally to be a Bird, with rare peculiarities indicative of a distinct order in that class’ (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 46). Falconer’s objections to Owen’s conclusions emerged in his role as one of the paper’s referees; he protested that the author overemphasised the ornithological evidence (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6790.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Rupke 1994</ref>, pp. 73–4).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">In his paper (Owen 1862a), Owen frequently compared features of <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> with those of familiar and extant birds; for example, he noted that it was similar in size to the peregrine falcon and rook (p. 34), representing Falconer’s ‘Raptores &amp; Passeres’, and he believed that the wings corresponded in form and proportion to those of gallinaceous birds, such as the quail or grouse (p. 36).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Unlike Owen, Falconer was impressed by indications of the fossil’s intermediate position between reptiles and birds. After hearing Owen’s paper (Owen 1862a), Hooker reported that the ‘general opinion was that Owen demonstrated its ornithic affinity and proved it to be a bird with the tail-feathers set on a jointed tail instead of the truculent hump that most birds have, but some say that there are peculiar bones or organs amongst the bones that may yet prove it to be Reptilian’ (L. Huxley ed. 1918, 2: 32).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">Owen reported in his paper that the head of <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> was absent from the specimen (Owen 1862a, p. 34). However, John Evans, an archaeologist and geologist who examined the fossil shortly after hearing Owen’s account, claimed to have discovered the cast of the specimen’s skull. He did not publish an account of his findings for two years (John <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2392.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Evans 1865</ref>), but the geologist and palaeontologist <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3104.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Samuel Joseph Mackie</ref> reported in the January 1863 issue of <hi rend="italic">The Geologist</hi> that Evans had found portions of the skull in the fossil slab (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5098.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Mackie 1863</ref>, pp. 7–8; see also Joan <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2390.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Evans 1943</ref>, pp. 115–16). Owen made reference to Evans’s findings at the end of the published version of his paper (Owen 1862a, p. 46), but did not express an opinion as to their validity.

Wagner, who had for many years studied fossil remains from the Solenhofen stone, published a description of <hi rend="italic">Archaeopteryx</hi> based on the verbal report of a friend who examined the specimen (J. A. Wagner 1861b). The paper was later translated and published in the <hi rend="italic">Annals and Magazine of Natural History</hi> with the title, ‘On a new fossil reptile supposed to be furnished with feathers’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8024.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. A. Wagner 1862</ref>). He named the creature <hi rend="italic">Griphosaurus</hi>, meaning a saurian that is an ‘enigma’. Wagner concluded (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8024.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. A. Wagner 1862</ref>, pp. 266–7): <quote type="quote"> I must add a few words to ward off Darwinian misinterpretations of our new Saurian. At the first glance of the <hi rend="italic">Griphosaurus</hi> we might certainly form a notion that we had before us an intermediate creature, engaged in the transition from the Saurian to the bird. Darwin and his adherents will probably employ the new discovery as an exceedingly welcome occurrence for the justification of their strange views upon the transformations of animals. But in this they will be wrong.... I am entitled to ask of the Darwinians … to show me, first of all, the intermediate steps by which the transition of some one living or extinct animal from one class into another was effected. If they cannot do this (as they certainly cannot), their views must be at once rejected as fantastic dreams, with which the exact investigation of nature has nothing to do. </quote> See also n. 14, below.</note>
