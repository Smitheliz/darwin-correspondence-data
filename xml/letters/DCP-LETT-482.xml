<p>I was surprized indeed to find how soon you had moved into your new house &amp; I don’t wonder you feel triumphant, I really begin to feel quite sorry for Mrs Irvine &amp; think we have cheated the poor woman. You must have found it very interesting putting all your things away &amp; arranging your sanctum to the greatest advantage, &amp; I should have liked very much to have helped you &amp; also to eat your eggs &amp; bacon afterwards. Fanny tells me to write to her about cooks, but I really do not know what to say or how we are ever to settle between the two she has seen they seem so much alike so you &amp; she must lay your heads together &amp; settle what you like. I should think 14 guineas &amp; tea &amp; sugar plenty. I will send off the linen by the canal the end of this week.</p>
<p>You seem to have received the letter I wrote on Sunday on Monday which puzzled as I thought they did not leave Newcastle the same day that they were written, so please to tell me when you receive this. The poor Seabridge folks<ref target="#foot.f1"/> are undergoing a visit from the Roberts.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> They came on Monday &amp; instead of going away on Saturday as any reasonable people would Robert is going by himself to do duty on Sunday at his living &amp; will leave his wife on their hands for three days. There is a wonderful degree of obtuseness about him. Allen<ref target="#foot.f3"/> seems to think that her temper is not very smooth at present &amp; that she watches him as much as ever. She never leaves him alone with his sisters a minute. Eliza<ref target="#foot.f4"/> is very unwell too which makes it more foolish of Robert staying so long. Elizabeth has a bad cough which I am sorry for as she is always a long time getting rid of it &amp; she has a new school mistress whom she wants to be looking after. I find it so curiously tiresome teaching the school now—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I suppose it is feeling as if it was no use now it is only for a few weeks. Now we are really in January I begin to feel as if something real was going to happen &amp; it makes me dream &amp; ponder a great deal. I hope you will manage to finish Glen Roy now &amp; get shut of it. I enclose two specimens of Caligraphy which have puzzled me &amp; I believe you will be obliged to call in Covington to your assistance.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I can fancy how proud you are in your big house, ordering breakfast in the front drawing room dinner in the dining room tea in the back drawing room &amp; luncheon in the study, &amp; occasionally looking through your window on your estate &amp; plantations.</p>
<p>Tell me how your Carlyle dinner went off. We have been living as quiet as mice here since Monday, reading aloud &amp; playing Cassino in the evening, very comfortable I think. Jos came on Saturday &amp; Sunday. We could not fathom what he thought of his daughter or whether he admired her. He says she is still weakly.</p>
<p>Goodbye dearest Charley your affectionate Emma W.</p>
<p>I am reading Mansfield Park which I find very suitable. Did you ever see such lovely weather. Write soon like a good boy for your letters are not thrown away upon me.</p>
<p>Thank Fanny <hi rend="underline">very much</hi> for her kind trouble.</p>
<p>I began my direction to old 36.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
