<p>I thank you much for your letter &amp; the parcel of shoots.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The case of the Yellow Plum is a treasure &amp; is now safely recorded on your authority in its proper place;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> in contrast with A. Knight’s case of yellow magnum bonum sporting into red.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I could see no difference in the shoots, except that those of the Yellow were thicker, &amp; I presume that this is merely accidental: as you do not mention it, I further presume that there are no differences in leaves or flowers of the two Plums.—</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear about the Yellow ash,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; that you yourself have seen the Jessamine case;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I must confess that I hardly fully believed in it; but now I do; &amp; very surprising it is.</p>
<p>In an old French Book, published in Amsterdam in 1786 (I think) there is an account apparently authentic &amp; attested by the writer as an eye-witness, of Hyacinth bulbs of two colours being cut in two &amp; grafted &amp; they sent up single stalk with differently coloured flowers on the two sides, &amp; some flowers parti-coloured.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I once thought of offering 5£ reward in Cottage Gardener for such a plant;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> but perhaps it would seem too foolish: no instructions are given when to perform the operation; I have tried 2 or 3 times &amp; utterly failed.— I find that I have a grand list of “bud-variations”, &amp; tomorrow shall work up such cases as I have about Roses—sports which seem very numerous, &amp; which I see you state to occur comparatively frequently.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>When a person is very good-natured, he gets much pestered,—a discovery which I daresay you have made, or anyhow will soon make; for I do want very much to know, whether you have sown seed of any Moss Roses, &amp; whether the seedlings were moss-roses.— Has a common Rose produced by <hi rend="underline">seed</hi> a moss-rose?<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>What can be the origin of the Austrian Bramble, which seems always to have imperfect pollen (at least I have found it so) &amp; which sport into a yellow rose:<ref target="#foot.f11"/> may not this be case like Laburnum?—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>If any light comes to you about very slight changes in the buds, pray have kindness to illuminate me: I have cases of 7 or 8 varieties of the Peach which have produced by “bud-variation” Nectarines;<ref target="#foot.f13"/> &amp; yet only one single case (in France) of a Peach producing another closely similar peach (but later in ripening).<ref target="#foot.f14"/> How strange it is that a great change in the Peach should occur not rarely &amp; <hi rend="underline">slighter</hi> changes apparently very rarely! How strange that no case seems recorded of new Apples or Pears or Apricots by “bud-variation”! How ignorant we are! But with the many good observers now living our children’s children will be less ignorant, &amp; that is a comfort. I am ashamed of myself to be so troublesome, &amp; am grateful. (<hi rend="underline">not</hi> for favour to come)—</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f12">The flowers of the Adam’s laburnum (<hi rend="italic">Cytisus adami</hi>), a sterile hybrid, were known to revert spontaneously to those of its fertile parent species, <hi rend="italic">C. laburnum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. purpureus</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 387–91); the originator of <hi rend="italic">C. adami</hi> claimed that it had been raised not by normal hybridisation, but by grafting a bud of <hi rend="italic">C. purpureus</hi> onto a stock of <hi rend="italic">C. laburnum</hi>.
