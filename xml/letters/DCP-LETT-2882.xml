<p>My dear Sir</p>
<p>I received several weeks ago your note telling me that you could not visit England, which I sincerely regretted, as I should most heartily have liked to have made your personal acquaintance.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> You gave me an improved, but not very good, account of your health. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. at some time be grateful for a line to tell me how you are.—</p>
<p>We have had a miserable summer owing to a terribly long &amp; severe illness of my eldest girl, who improves slightly but is still in a precarious condition.—</p>
<p>I have been able to do nothing in science of late. My kind friend Asa Gray often writes to me &amp; tells me of the warm discussions on origin of species in the U. States.—   Whenever you are strong enough to read it, I know you will be dead against me, but I know equally well that your opposition will be liberal &amp; philosophical. And this is a good deal more than I can say of all my opponents in this country. I have not yet seen Agassiz’s attack;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but I hope to find it at home, when I return in few days, for I have been for several weeks away from home on my daughter’s account. Prof. Silliman sent me an extremely kind message by Asa Gray that your Journal w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be open to a reply by me;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I cannot decide till I see it, but on principle I have resolved to avoid answering anything, as it consumes much time, often temper, &amp; I have said my say in the Origin.—   No one person understands my views &amp; has defended them so well as A. Gray;—though he does not by any means go all the way with me.—   There was much discussion on subject at B. Assoc. at Oxford; &amp; I had many defenders &amp; my side seems (for I was not there) almost to have got the best of the battle.—   Your correspondent &amp; my neighbour J. Lubbock goes on working at such spare time as he has.—</p>
<p>This is an egotistical note; but I have not seen a naturalist for months. Most sincerely &amp; deeply do I hope that this note may find you almost recovered.</p>
<p>Pray believe me | Yours very truly | C. Darwin</p>
