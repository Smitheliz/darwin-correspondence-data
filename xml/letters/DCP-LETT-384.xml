<p>Will you have the kindness to give a message to Prof. Miller from me, &amp; another to L. Jenyns.— I write to you because I do not want to trouble either of them with a letter for a single word,—and you will probably soon see them &amp; give it vivâ voce.— I left with Miller, last winter some geological specimens.— I should be very much obliged if he would make <hi rend="doubleUnderline">soon</hi> a list of the numbers (<hi rend="underline">specifying the colour of the paper</hi>) for otherwise I might be hunting in vain for hours.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I ought at the time to have made a list, but neglected doing so. When I know which he has got, I will ask him to tell me something about those which I may want, &amp; which he had the kindness to say he would do.—</p>
<p>My message to L. Jenyns, is simply that I expect T. Eyton to pay me a visit before long, when he comes up to town, &amp; that the fish had better be sent <hi rend="underline">soon</hi> by waggon to 36 Great Marlborough St.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Pray tell Leonard, that my government work is going on smoothly &amp; I hope will be prosperous.— He will see in the prospectus his name attached to the fish. I set my shoulder to the work with a good heart.— I am very much better than I was during the last month before my Shrewsbury visit— I fear the geology will take me a great deal of time, I was looking over one set of notes, &amp; the quantity I found I had to read, for that one place was frightful— If I live till I am eighty years old I shall not cease to marvel at finding myself an author: in the summer, before I started, if anyone had told me I should have been an angel by this time, I should have thought it an equal improbability. This marvellous transformation is all owing to you.—</p>
<p>I am sorry to find, that a good many errata are left in the part of my volume, which is printed: During my absence M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Colburn employed some goose to revise, &amp; he has multiplied, instead of diminishing my oversights:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but for all that, the smooth paper and clear type has a charming appearance, and I sat the other evening gazing in silent admiration at the first page of my own volume, when I received it from the printers!</p>
<p>Good bye My dear Henslow.—pray remember me to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Henslow and all your family, by whom I shall be quite forgotten, if I do not pay Cambridge a visit before very long, but when that is to be, “Quien sabe?” as the Spaniard says | C. Darwin <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> Saturday</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD’s ‘Diary of observations on the geology of the places visited during the voyage’ (DAR 32.1, 32.2, and 33) has the number for each specimen in the margin; CD used paper of different colours for different ranges of numbers. In his notebooks listing geological specimens CD wrote the following code:  Red = 1000 + &amp;c Green = 2000 + &amp;c Yellow = 3000 + &amp;c Thus 378 yellow = 3378. The specimens are now in the Mineralogical Collection of the Department of Earth Sciences, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_795.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Cambridge University</ref>. The notebooks are in the Darwin Archive, University Library, Cambridge, on deposit from the Department of Earth Sciences. Other lists of numbered specimens are in DAR 39.1.</note>
