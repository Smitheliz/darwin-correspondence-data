<p>Many thanks for your letter which I have been very glad to receive. I was sure that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> feel much annoyment with respect to Mr Horsman’s conduct in your parish. About the Sunday School affairs I know nothing.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>On June 2 Mr H. wrote to me a foolish letter, in which he said he believed that he held some balance on the school account. I wrote immediately in answer asking him to send me a cheque for the amount together with all accounts &amp; documents relating to the school. I told him that on their receipt I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> send him a formal acknowledgment; but I have not heard <hi rend="underline">a word from</hi> him since.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The accounts of the Nat. school<ref target="#foot.f4"/> were audited up to Dec 31. 1867, &amp; Mr H. has a balance in hand of £8—4—10; but this balance I now find includes the childrens pence deposits for a large portion of 67. Mr H. has rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> no money this year from the schoolmaster;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> nor, as far as I can hear, has he paid any thing; for the schoolmaster was not paid for last quarter, &amp; now a second qr will soon be due, both of which I will advance.</p>
<p>I have also advanced today £9—19—2 for children’s deposit with interest.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Mr H. says he has not received interest on trust money from Sir J. Lubbock; to whom I will write in a few days to enquire whether any funds have been paid or are due to us.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I do not think Mr H. can have rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> any subscriptions for either school during this year. He owes, I am told some few bills in the village. There is one more serious matter; he was curiously anxious to get up a subscription for the new organ &amp; some of the Lubbocks have suggested that he may have pocketed the money &amp; never paid for it. No one seems to know what the organ really cost. I do not know whether it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> make one liable or whether it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be a proper step to write to Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Bryceson 34 Brook St. Euston Road. N.W to enquire.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Mr H. almost entirely neglected the school &amp; considerable repairs were found necessary so that I fear the school account will be in a bad way. I have written all these details as I thought you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to know exactly how the affairs of the Nat. School stand.</p>
<p>I much hope that you may succeed soon in arranging that some clergyman sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have permanent charge of this parish. I am much obliged for your offer with respect to the purchase of the advowson, but it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not be in my way.— I am sincerely grieved that you should have all this annoyment &amp; trouble about this Parish. Certainly it will be good thing for everybody &amp; for the character of the Church to get rid of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horsman.</p>
<p>I almost think he is more an utter fool than knave.— The schoolmaster said he sent him a cheque signed, but left blank to be filled up, to any amount, which was an insane proceeding if he had any money at his Bank; but the next day he wrote to the Schoolmaster retracting the permission to fill up the cheque.—</p>
<p>Should I hear from Sir John L. that he has paid any interest on Trust, during current year, I will let you know.—</p>
<p>Believe me, Dear Innes | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
