<p>Postscript 1</p>
<p>As you are staying at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwins just repeat to him the 3 or 4 Incidents which crossed my mind when reading his interesting book on Expression of Animals—when at Kew—</p>
<p>As you may however have probably forgotten them I will tell them as briefly as possible.</p>
<p>The first subject was relating to my having tried, a few years ago, to mesmerize (or whatever it might be called) my Pet dog.</p>
<p>Having heard it was necessary in mesmerism to fix ones eyes on the eyes of the living object about to be worked on, I tried it, (tho’ merely as a joke not expecting any result) on my Dog (a Retriever) just before I was going to unchain him for a walk, so calling his attention I approached him &amp; then suddenly stood motionless with my eyes fixed on <hi rend="underline">his</hi> eyes &amp; he stood as if fixed to the ground also perfectly motionless never taking his eyes off me, when in a few minutes he began to shiver &amp; tremble until I observed his hair &amp; tail gradually rising—then his upper lips, when he suddenly made a savage rush at me &amp; had I been within his reach, would undoubtedly have bitten me, but the moment I relaxed my position &amp; called him by his name he was suddenly subdued &amp; then crouched at my feet as if sorry at having rushed at me!!</p>
<p>The other case related to my poor wife<ref target="#foot.f2"/> who had been subject occasionally to a sort of numbness in her face, supposed to have arisen from pressure on some nerves.</p>
<p>She could invariably foretell an attack coming on by a peculiar sensation in her hair on combing it—a sort of rough bristly feel about it, tho’ at other times her hair was peculiarly soft.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Lastly respecting Birds, but <hi rend="underline">very trifling</hi> what I observed at Bottisham—</p>
<p>We had several coveys of very tame Partridges &amp; I invariably observed that on a fine warm still day when they were lying down in the park, they would one after the other every now &amp; then jump up into the air &amp; then take a little circuitous run &amp; squat down again.— Moreover this peculiar jump &amp; circuitous skirmish ‘I have often observed in a Farmyard among <hi rend="underline">young Pigs</hi> &amp; chickens’ on fine days all to express joy I suppose’   The same joy as I have seen with young birds—i.e. a young Rook hopping about the Park on the grass suddenly flapping its wings or its Mother arriving <hi rend="underline">with</hi> some dainty morsel’<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
