<p>I am very much obliged by your letter. I shall be truly relieved when the complications about Mr Horsman are unravelled.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I heard from him some days ago (about 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> but the letters are not dated) that he should write to the Archbishop &amp; resign; I had told him that it was my intention to submit his conduct to the A B.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>A later note tells me he had not yet done this, speaks of present ill health, and seems to suggest, without directly proposing, a temporary arrangement with a view to his future return. To this I have answered that unless I hear this week at latest that he has himself sent in his resignation, I shall at once report to his Grace.</p>
<p>I go a step beyond you in my opinion of his folly, and my idea if true takes off from his culpability, that he is not quite sane. It is not a new notion but one I formed when I first saw him. I mentioned it in a talk I had with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lovegrove who seemed to have seen most of him at that time,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> and which he thought was absolutely unfounded, but I really think he is mad, and if so I am sorry for him as well as for myself and the inhabitants—</p>
<p>When he succeeded M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Stephens there was a balance in hand for Sunday School of £3<hi rend="superscript">.</hi> <hi rend="superscript">s</hi>11—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I conclude he paid all to Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. when Amy Duberry was paid—not since she tells me. If he received the Annual subscription at the End of the Year he will owe—</p>

<p>Since then it would appear no receipts or payments—</p>
<p>I am inclined to think the organ must have been settled for at the time; possibly M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lovegrove may know.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Horsman wrote me several letters about it. The cost was to be £145—less old organ 40. and in the letter acknowledging my subscription he says the whole amount was subscribed—14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Sept. 67— Under the circumstances, and knowing that the price was paid by subscriptions Byceson would never have waited long for the money.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have an application from a M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Vernon <figure type="inlinediagram"/> [DIAG HERE]alin. (I fail to decipher the first letter of the surname and copy the hieroglyphic which may be P. or E or any other).<ref target="#foot.f7"/> who says he has been to Downe at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horsman’s desire for a month, and wishing to continue. Do you know anything of his acceptance (as Scotch folk say).</p>
<p>I have not at this moment any other application, indeed I must get Horsmans matters settled before I can positively arrange, but whether for a longer or shorter time I should like to send someone who would be acceptable and make up for some of the recent neglect—</p>
<p>We are in sad want of rain here, and our crops of all kinds in a very bad condition— It has been a most unusual season for wind, as well as drouth   Our normal condition has been half or whole gales ever since Jan 5—</p>
<p>With our kind regards | Believe Me | Faithfully Yours | J Brodie Innes.</p>
