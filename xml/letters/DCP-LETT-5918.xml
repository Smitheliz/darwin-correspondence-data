            <p>Fears Pangenesis is still-born. Cites Bates, Spencer, Lubbock, and Sir Henry Holland. Is sure Pangenesis will sometime reappear. Questions that are connected and answered by Pangenesis.</p>

<p>I have had almost as many letters to write of late, as you can have—viz from 8–10 per diem,—chiefly getting up facts on sexual selection; therefore I have felt no inclination to write to you, &amp; now I mean to write solely about my Book, for my own satisfaction, &amp; not at all for yours.— The first Edit was <hi rend="doubleUnderline">1</hi>500 copies, &amp; now the second is printed off,—sharp work.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Did you look at the Review in the Athenæum, showing profound contempt of me. I feel convinced it is by Owen—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Pouchet— Mr. <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Charles</hi> Darwin, always in full &amp; other little strokes. It is a shame that he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have said that I have taken much from Pouchet without acknowledgement; for I took literally nothing, there being nothing to take.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> There is capital R. in Gardeners Chronicle—which will sell the book, if anything will—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I do not quite see whether I or the writer is in a muddle about man <hi rend="underline">causing</hi> variability.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> If a man drops a bit of iron into Sulphuric acid he does not cause the affinities to come into play, yet he may be said to make Sulphate of Iron. I do not know how to avoid ambiguity. After what Pall Mall<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; G. Chronicle have said, I do not care a d—. for Owen.—</p>
<p>I fear Pangenesis is still-born. Bates says he has read it twice &amp; is not sure that he understands it.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> H. Spencer says the view is quite different from his (&amp; this a great relief to me, as I feared to be accused of plagiarism, but utterly failed to be sure what he meant, so thought it safest to give my view as almost same as his) &amp; he says he is not sure he understands it.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Sir J. Lubbock says he shall wait, before he expresses his opinion, &amp; see what the Reviews say.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Am I not a poor Devil; yet I took such pains, I must think that I expressed myself clearly   Old Sir H. Holland says he has read it twice &amp; thinks it very tough, but believes that sooner or later “some view akin to it” will be accepted.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>You will think me very self-sufficient, when I declare that I feel <hi rend="underline">sure</hi> if Pangenesis is now still born it will thank God at some future time reappear, begotten by some other Father, &amp; christened by some other name.—</p>
<p>Have you ever met with any tangible &amp; clear view of what takes place in generation, whether by seeds or buds.— Or how a long-lost character can possibly reappear—or how the male element can possibly affect the mother-plant—or the mother animal so that her future progeny are affected. Now all these points &amp; many others are connected to-gether,—whether truly or falsely is another question—by Pangenesis.— You see I die hard, &amp; stick up for my poor child.—</p>
<p>This letter is written for my own satisfaction &amp; not for yours—so bear it.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">The reviewer claimed that CD argued ambiguously with regard to the role of human agency in the production of variations: ‘if altered conditions cause variability, and man alters a plant’s condition, he may fairly be charged with causing variability—just as fairly as a man who so places a sovereign before a thievish boy, as that boy will surely steal it’ (<hi rend="italic">Gardeners’ Chronicle</hi>, p. 184).</note>
