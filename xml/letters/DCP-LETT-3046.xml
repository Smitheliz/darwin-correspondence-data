            <p>Thanks WDF for an inkstand that keeps ink from getting muddy.</p>
            <p>Asks if WDF can verify truth of a statement that white sows carry their young for a longer or shorter time (CD forgets which) than other colours. Presumes it is false, "but many odd peculiarities are correlated with colour".</p>

<p>I received yesterday from my Brother the two Inkstands for William &amp; myself; &amp; we are both very much obliged for your present.</p>
<p>I have filled mine this morning &amp; it seems to work capitally, but I have not yet had much writing with it, as I have been merely correcting proofs—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> The only fault is that I sometimes take too much ink, but with a little practice I shall get over this, &amp; I have been eternally plagued with my Ink getting muddy, &amp; if that is avoided I shall be for an equal eternity grateful to you,—as no doubt William will, who writes as detestably bad a hand as I do &amp; my good Father did before me.—</p>
<p>We manage to keep Etty room of a good temperature &amp; I do not think she suffers from the extreme &amp; dreadful cold: she has been rather better these 4 or 5 days than usual. All my Boys are now at home &amp; very jolly.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Farewell my dear Fox &amp; I hope always to keep your Inkstand, as a memorial of you by me.—</p>
<p>Farewell | Your affect | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I believe you have been a pig-Breeder. I found a strange statement in a German Book that white Sows go with young a week longer or shorter (I forget which) than piebald or black Sows.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I presume it is false: but many odd peculiarities are correlated with colour.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Have you kept any exact record? Or do you know any careful Breeder that does?—</p>
<p>Do not think of answering this unless you have materials to judge by.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It must be a cock &amp; bull story, though given rather positively by goodish man.—</p>
