<p>Just read the enclosed, &amp; return it. Keeping it private, I have answered that in such an emergency I was sure that the R.S. would not stand in the way, but have begged him to ask his medical man— I have assured him that for his own &amp; family’s sake he should not attempt it, &amp; I have warned him that considering what his health was 2 years ago, he will assuredly receive a round-robin from all his friends imploring him not to do so suicidal a thing. Just fancy—to have the Secretaryship of R.S., &amp; his winter classes here, followed by a <hi rend="underline">full course</hi> in Edinburgh, not over till August!<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I wait impatiently for his answer to me.</p>
<p>Harriet is getting on nicely &amp; Miss Boycott is a very pleasant girl, as well as a thoroughly well brought up one. I could not wish Harriet a nicer companion.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am very busy; my first instinct after entering the House was to rush back to Down; but I soon got over that, &amp; I have now to abbreviate those intervals between work, when the utter desolation falls like a black cloud over all my purport &amp; pursuits.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>

<p>The Edinburgh Professors are in a quandary— Victor Carus who was appointed Wyville Thomson’s substitute for some reason or other cannot lecture next summer and has left them in the lurch—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Turner wrote to me a day or two ago to know if I could &amp; would help them in this fix<ref target="#foot.f5"/>—and give the course which lasts through May June &amp; July   At first it seemed to me out of the question— But on second thoughts it appeared <hi rend="italic">[</hi>possible<hi rend="italic">]</hi>— I can manage the May examinations by deputy—for once—and I have no doubt that as W. T. is away on Government service I could get the requisite leave from My Lords</p>
<p>Remains the Royal Society— In May &amp; June there are five meetings—one for election of Fellows is merely formal &amp; does not need my presence   Two are on the same day as Council meetings and for them I could come up</p>
<p>Considering that Thomson is away on Royal Society business to a certain extent<ref target="#foot.f6"/> do you think there would be any harm in my omitting attendance at the Evening Meetings?</p>
<p>I should like to help in the difficulty— I should like to give the Edinburgh folks a specimen of what I think the teaching of my subject ought to be—and I by no means object to the money— I have written to Turner to say that subject to the assent of the Gov<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> &amp; the R.S. I think the thing may be done— But it is all contingent &amp; in the air at present</p>
<p>How are you getting on? I trust building yourself a bridge over the abyss bravely<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I wish I could help you</p>
