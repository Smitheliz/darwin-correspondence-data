<p>I have just been informed of your excessive kindness and liberality to my dear Brother Edwards Widow.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I together with Mother &amp; sisters feel the benevolence acutely.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Most unfortunately my father,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> contrary to his general principles, acted in making his Will directly in opposition to the Law of Gavelkind, upon which as a Kentish Man, he used to boast, And strictly entailed all his property, <hi rend="underline">at my mothers death</hi>, thereby preventing any of us from benefitting immediately, from our inheritance. I therefore as a hard worked general Med Pract with six youngsters<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; without a penny Capital (<hi rend="underline">being unable to raise on my reversion</hi>) could only offer my brothers widow a share of our home, to which she is heartily welcome. The generosity of yourself &amp; other friends have now placed her in an independent position. I have therefore great cause to be grateful to you, and if as the Mouse observed on a memorable occasion I can serve you in any way please give me the pleasurable opportunity,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> sometimes in your laborious investigations, you may require data, which the pursuits of Leech craft yields, should such a requirement arise, please remember that it would be a delight to me, to work out your behests.</p>
<p>Some few years since I gave Edward the history of a rather interesting case, which may be a bit of an illustration of your Grand Theory, I dont know if ever he remembered to hand it to you. A farmer in Suffolk smashed three ribs, they united badly, the case being a bad one, I wont lay all the blame upon the old bone setter who officiated, but by some smal adaption, one rib crossed the other &amp; adhered. Years afterwards the old man came under my care for Organic Disease he lost flesh &amp; the old fracture became more observable; eventually his son came under me, and then I discovered a precisely similar <hi rend="underline">congenital</hi> deformity of <hi rend="underline">the same</hi> ribs, he was born within 12 months of the fathers accident.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I hoped to have obtained for you a Leperine, as the fancier <hi rend="underline">who lived</hi> here, calls some rabbits, which he <hi rend="underline">declares</hi>, he has bred, as follows, he puts a doe rabbit with a male hare he expects, that they connect, but would not breed, he then admits the Buck rabbit, and the progeny partake of some properties of the Hare<ref target="#foot.f7"/>   I have made him extensive offers &amp; am this season promised a specimen, I dont trust to the fellow as he is a sporting Character, but he persists in his yarn. Is it probable?.</p>
<p>With Thanks for your goodness | I remain My dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin | Yours obliged | Theodore Grant Cresy</p>
