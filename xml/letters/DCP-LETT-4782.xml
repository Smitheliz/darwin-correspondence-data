<p>Thomson has gone over Scott’s paper.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; the enclosed is his conclusion;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> he is a scientific arithmetician &amp; would I am sure solve the difficulty if soluble; the Denominators are obviously arbitrary &amp; useless.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have read through Scott’s paper, &amp; am amazed at his industry &amp; ability, but in its present state the paper is not fit for publication, &amp; I think the experiments should have been repeated—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> his discord with Gærtner either shakes the whole value of his system of experimentation, or shows that similar experiments give different results, or that one of the observers is wrong.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>You are the only judge of the value of such a paper:— it is awfully tedious to read. Much of it is simply a repetition of the Tables, &amp; that part might be shortened—perhaps.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The woodcuts were for <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Climbing plants’</ref>, an abstract of which was read at the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> on 2 February 1865; Currey was evidently preparing the paper for publication in the society’s journal. The paper included thirteen woodcuts. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Climbing plants’</ref>, p. 49 n., CD wrote that figures 5 to 13 were drawn from living plants by his son, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1224.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Howard Darwin</ref>; in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1458.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Climbing plants</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. v, CD wrote that all the illustrations were drawn by George.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The references are to Thomas Thomson and to a draft of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7026.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Scott 1867</ref>. John Scott sent the manuscript and a separate (missing) letter on the same subject to CD from Calcutta on 4 January 1865 (see letters from John Scott, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4751.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">20 January 1865</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4876.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">21 July 1865</ref>); CD may have given Hooker the manuscript during his visit to Down House between 4 and 6 March 1865. Thomson was based at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, while collaborating with Hooker on material for a new <hi rend="italic">Flora Indica</hi> (see L. Huxley ed. 1918, 2: 12). There is an annotated copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7026.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Scott 1867</ref> in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">The enclosure has not been found; CD may have forwarded Thomson’s criticisms to Scott (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4788.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 16 [March 1865]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">In his published paper, in order to show the ‘comparative fertility of the different unions’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7026.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Scott 1867</ref>, tables 2–7, pp. 153–62), Scott counted the number of capsules and seeds resulting from self-pollination in a species or variety of <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi>, and the number resulting from cross-pollination with other species or varieties. He then calculated the number of seeds that would have been produced from each cross if twenty capsules had been formed and divided the number of seeds produced by cross-pollination between the various taxa by the number of seeds produced by a self-pollinated plant, and multiplied that figure by 1000. This yielded a figure for comparative fertility ranging from 1000 for a self-pollinated <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi> species to 242 for the least fertile cross between two different species of <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi>. In his draft manuscript, Scott may have made an error in the method of this last step in the calculation. In the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4876.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 21 July 1865</ref>, Scott apologised for the ‘<hi rend="doubleUnderline">singular blunderings</hi>’ in his calculations.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4876.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter of 21 July 1865</ref>, Scott revealed to CD that his manuscript had been written on the ship to India, from notes on experiments that he had made on <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi> at the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (see n. 8, below). There is no indication in the published paper (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7026.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Scott 1867</ref>) that further experiments were made in India. Scott sailed for India on 28 August 1864, arriving 21 December 1864 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 12, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4613.xml" resp="#automat">letter to J. H. Balfour, 15 September [1864]</ref>, and this volume, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4751.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 20 January 1865</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">The reference is to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1774.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Karl Friedrich von Gärtner’s</ref> experiments with <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi> in which crosses between differently coloured varieties of the same or of different species were found to be less fertile than parallel crosses between similarly coloured varieties (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2735.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gärtner 1844</ref> and 1849). CD discussed these experiments in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 270–1, and encouraged Scott to attempt these and similar experiments in the letters to John Scott, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3814.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">19 November [1862]</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3853.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">11 December [1862]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10). CD also sent Scott a digest of Gärtner’s experiments (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7026.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Scott 1867</ref>, p. 164). On the importance of Gärtner’s work for CD’s theory of natural selection, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, Appendix VI. Scott’s experiments on <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi> were made in 1863 and 1864 (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4301.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 21 September [1863]</ref>, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 12, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Scott, 16 May [1864]</ref>). Scott’s published conclusion from these experiments was that there was no clear relationship between affinities of colour and degrees of fertility in crossing varieties of distinct species of <hi rend="italic">Verbascum</hi>, but that with varieties of the same species, similarly coloured varieties were more fertile when crossed than differently coloured varieties (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7026.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Scott 1867</ref>, pp. 165–6, 171–2). CD discussed Scott’s results in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 2: 106–7.</note>
