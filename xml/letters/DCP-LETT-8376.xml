<p>My brother E B Tylor has mentioned to me that you are not disinclined to look into the evidence for a “Pluvial Period”   This term has been adopted, since I first introduced it, by Prof Morris &amp; Prof T. R Jones in their lectures and in the Geol. Magazine, by Prof Phillips in his lectures and in his new book<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>It has met with great opposition at the Geological Society and I have had the greatest difficulty to get any allusion to it permitted in the Quarterly Journal.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> As Mr Belgrand was 20 years later than myself in his idea of great rainfall I thought the late president might have put in a note of reference to some of the papers of which I enclose a list as the argument of Belgrand in 1870 was the same as my own in 1853<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I suppose on account of my having opposed the High &amp; low level gravel theory of Prestwich &amp; Lyell some years since (which is now rarely mentioned by any of its supporters) there has been a feeling of opposition against the Wet period as being in bad company<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>My paper, which the Council refused to publish Nov 1868 contains some important evidence new facts, &amp; new reasoning, and I hope the Council will allow it to be published as a postponed paper.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I wish your friend Sir C Lyell would look into the whole subject &amp; particularly at the points of difference—</p>
<p>I have a paper coming on at the Civil Engineers on the Flow of Water and have many new facts about rivers. The Somerset House authorities make such a favour of publishing any thing in the river way that I am obliged to send my paper elsewhere.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> If more mechanical views &amp; reasoning were admitted &amp; considered some of the unsettled questions might be solved in geology.</p>

In a series of papers read in 1867 and 1868, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Tylor</ref> theorised that early post-glacial river gravel deposits could be explained by a ‘Pluvial’ period of higher than normal rainfall (A.<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7893.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Tylor 1867</ref>, 1868a, 1868b, 1868c). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3408.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Morris</ref> was professor of geology at University College, London, and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2608.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Rupert Jones</ref> was professor of geology at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst; the term appears in a report of a Geologists’ Association excursion to Guildford led by Morris (<hi rend="italic">Geological Magazine</hi> 6 (1869): 331–3), in a paper ‘On the primæval rivers of Britain’ by Jones (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4235.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">T. R. Jones 1870</ref>), and in the report of a lecture by Jones on the geology of the Kingsclere valley (<hi rend="italic">Geological Magazine</hi> 8 (1871): 511–15). John Phillips, professor of geology at Oxford, used the term in his <hi rend="italic">Geology of Oxford and the valley of the Thames</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6280.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Phillips 1871</ref>, p. 492).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">An abstract of Tylor’s paper on the Quaternary gravels of England, read at the meeting of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1841.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Geological Society of London</ref> on 6 May 1868, was published in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society</hi> (A. Tylor 1868a); it was published in full in the next volume (A. Tylor 1868b). In the discussion following the reading of the paper all nine recorded speakers disagreed with Tylor’s thesis, including <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3854.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Prestwich</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1262.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Boyd Dawkins</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref>, and Searles Valentine Wood (1830–84) (<hi rend="italic">Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London</hi> 24 (1868): 456).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Tylor read a paper at the Geological Society in December 1852 on the causes of sea-level change and denudation, but it was withdrawn from publication and appeared only as an abstract in the 1853 volume of the society’s <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7890.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Tylor 1852</ref>). The abstract does not make explicit reference to a sustained period of increased rainfall. In a recent address to the Geological Society, the outgoing president, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3854.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Prestwich</ref>, had referred to claims by the French hydrologist <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_6378.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">François-Eugène Belgrand</ref> that evidence from the Seine basin suggested rainfall in the early post-glacial period had been substantially heavier than in modern times (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6415.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Prestwich 1872</ref>, p. lxviii; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_511.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Belgrand 1869</ref>). The enclosed list has not been found, but see n. 6, below.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Prestwich, followed by Lyell, had identified two distinct levels of gravel deposits along the river Somme that they considered to be of glacial origin but of different ages (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6410.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Prestwich 1859</ref>, 1862; C. Lyell 1863, pp. 130–44). Tylor had challenged this view, arguing that the gravel deposits were more recent than Prestwich and Lyell suggested, were all of the same age, and were the result of flooding (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7892.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Tylor 1866</ref> and 1867; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7897.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Tylor 1872</ref>, pp. 498–9).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">A paper by Tylor on the formation of deltas was read at the Geological Society meeting of 11 November 1868, but only an abstract of it was published by the society (A. Tylor 1868c); a full version of the paper appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Geological Magazine</hi> in 1872, together with an appendix outlining Tylor’s view of the disputes surrounding it (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7897.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Tylor 1872</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">The Geological Society had rooms in Somerset House on the Strand in London until 1874.
