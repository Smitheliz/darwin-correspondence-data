<p>I am so weak in the head that I hardly know if I can write, but at all events I will jot down a few things that the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> has said.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He has not read much above half, so as he says he can give no definite conclusion, &amp; it is my private belief he wishes to remain in that state, till others have, &amp; a day or two ago, the book was not published even if it is now. He is evidently in a dreadful state of indecision &amp; keeps stating that he is not tied down to either view &amp; that he has always left an escape by the way in which he has spoken of varieties. I happened to speak of the eye before he had read that part, &amp; it took away his breath—utterly impossible—structure—function &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c. but when he had read it he hummed &amp; hawed &amp; perhaps it was partly conceivable, &amp; then he fell back on the bones of the ear which were beyond all possibility or conceivability.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He mentioned a slight blot which I also observed, that in speaking of the slave ants carrying one another you change the species without giving notice first, &amp; it makes one turn back.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The great fact of all was that he has written an article on Relation of Man to other animals, bringing them much closer together &amp; that he has withdrawn it, as it would be necessary to notice your book, &amp; he would not like to controvert you or interfere with the review upon you. &amp;c &amp;c<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>In regard to your boils, he asked if you had considered how far they followed or were connected with the water cure to which he evidently attributed them.</p>
<p>For myself I really think it is the most interesting book I ever read, &amp; can only compare it to the first knowledge of chemistry, getting into a new world or rather behind the scenes. To me the geographical distribution I mean the relation of islands to continents is the most convincing of the proofs, &amp; the relation of the oldest forms to the existing species. I dare say I dont feel enough the absence of varieties,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> but then I dont in the least know if every thing now living were fossilized whether the palæontologists could distinguish them. In fact the a priori reasoning is so entirely satisfactory to me that if the facts wont fit in, why so much the worse for the facts is my feeling.</p>
<p>My ague has left me in such a state of torpidity that I wish I had gone thro’ the process of natural selection.</p>
