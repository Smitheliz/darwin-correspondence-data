<p>In sending you herewith copies of Bulletins No. 2 &amp; 3, National Museum, containing some notes upon the Natural History of Kerguelen Island, I beg leave to invite your attention particularly to the Study of chionis minor (pp. 85–86 &amp; 114).<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>The study is based upon, or rather was suggested by, a passing remark of yours in the “Voyage of a Naturalist”, the accuracy and prevision of which have been fully borne out by this investigation.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> We think that there is good ground for the opinion that this bird represents an ancestral form, intermediate between the plover-snipe and gull-petrel groups, and from which both have descended.</p>
<p>Certainly, whether or not it be true that Kerguelen Island is one of the few surviving peaks of a great Antarctic continent, it would be difficult to devise conditions more fitted for the permanence of ancient forms, undisturbed by variation, than are there to be found. Dr. Hooker long ago (184Σ) commented upon its surprising richness in new floral genera &amp; species (many of them peculiar to the island), and the close resemblance of its Flora to that of S. America, although Africa is so much nearer at hand.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The recent Transit of Venus expeditions have shown peculiarities and anomalies as remarkable pertaining to its Fauna, and especially in the class of Insects, tied down by their structure to the soil.</p>
<p>The field has by no means yet been thoroughly explored, as is plainly shown by the number of different forms obtained by the various collectors of the different parties, and it is very much to be hoped that this spot, so peculiarly isolated &amp; set apart, as if for the purpose of illustrating the Origin of Species, may soon be thoroughly examined with a view solely to the knowledge of its Natural History.</p>
<p>I am, sir, with great respect, | very sincerely yours | J. H. Kidder | Surgeon U.S. Navy</p>
