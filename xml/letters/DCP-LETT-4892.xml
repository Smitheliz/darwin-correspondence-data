<p>Your note<ref target="#foot.f1"/> reached me here yesterday where I have been spending a month most agreeably walking and sketching or rather smudging to be accurate—&amp; I must say that though roughish the civilisation of Cornwall is much pleasanter than the want of it in New Brunswick<ref target="#foot.f2"/>   I am reminded of my last summer’s trip by a blue nose brig with a regular blue nose skipper &amp; blue nose crew<ref target="#foot.f3"/> having just come to grief here   he takes it easy saying it t’aint a place &amp; didn’t ought to be down in the chart.</p>
<p>I am truly sorry I was out or rather away when George called but hope he will look me up again before he returns to Cambridge.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I shall be at the office on Thursday &amp; Friday &amp; perhaps Saturday but shall ask him to drop me a line to say which day he will call as I have to look after some out of door matters.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> But it would be much pleasanter if his time allows if he will come &amp; dine with me &amp; sleep at my house any day after the 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. as I shall then be back for good &amp; till then shall be standing off &amp; on—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>We are both greatly concerned to hear you have been so unwell.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Although you have many active disciples still your own illness is a national calamity especially when we are all so anxious to see your views extending— It is satisfactory though to see how they are extending. I brought Vogt’s lectures on man just published by the Anthropological Society with me to read here &amp; see that although strongly opposed to Lamarck he confesses to complete conversion to Darwinism—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> If you have not read him you will be amused at his Huxleyan outspokenness,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> still more at the excessive naïveté of the translator D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James Hunt who struck out a few passages as likely to offend pious people but to mollify the savan’s indignation at his want of courage he his printed the omitted matter in the Appendix!<ref target="#foot.f10"/> though why these should horrify people more than much which he has left in puzzles me to see.</p>
<p>I must tell you of a very beautiful because remarkably homely illustration of your solution of one of the difficulties of Nat selection viz the hexagonal combs. We had a plumb pudding for dinner &amp; from the cook having exactly hit the right tenacity &amp; thinness of crust it came up a complete sphere mapped out with hexagonal articulations, not here &amp; there a pasty hexagon but the whole covered with exact regular hexagons— By guesswork each plumb should have punched just a swelling &amp; then a round hole for itself like a round shot through a plank but I suppose the strain came to equally on all parts of the crust so the spherical plumbs laid the foundation, without any instinctive knowledge of a series of regular hexagonal combs—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Ask George to write to Spring Gardens.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> My wife desires kindest remembrances to yourself &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> &amp; Miss Darwin.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> she has benefitted immensely here—</p>
<p>Very truly yours | E Cresy <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

CD’s annotated copy is in the Darwin Library–CUL (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi></ref> 1: 824). Vogt relates how, when he opposed earlier theories of transmutation, such as that of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2786.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Jean Baptiste de Lamarck</ref>, he was ‘much prejudiced by received opinions’, and claimed that his gradual acceptance of CD’s version of the theory was the result of ‘continued self-instruction’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7997.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Vogt 1864</ref>, pp. 446–7).

In a letter to CD, Cresy had recently referred to Huxley’s ‘boldly proclaiming his faith in Darwinism’ in a lecture at the Royal Institution (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4856.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Edward Cresy, 9 June 1865</ref> and n. 7).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">A one-page appendix was placed at the end of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7997.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Vogt 1864</ref>. It contained passages that Hunt, the president of the Anthropological Society, had excised from the main body of the text, such as the observations that Byzantine artists gave the Madonna ape-like arms, or that the ape brain most similar to that of humans belonged to the ‘devil’s ape’ (<hi rend="italic">Ateles belzebuth</hi>, a spider monkey; see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7997.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Vogt 1864</ref>, p. 470).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 224–35, CD had explained how the hexagonal cell produced by hive-bees could have developed by a simple principle of gradation. He considered how the cells of the Mexican <hi rend="italic">Melipona</hi> bee, which had flat sides at points where the spherical shapes intersected, were intermediate between the simple rounded cells of the humble-bee and the perfect hexagonal cells of the hive-bee. He argued that the hive-bees’ ability to make perfectly hexagonal cells was not so difficult to explain as it might appear, because the hexagonal walls were only formed when equidistant circular cells intersected at flat walls of wax added by the bees. Thus, the hexagonal shape, the most efficient for optimal storage, was a by-product of the spacing of circular cells. CD’s notes on the structure of bee-cells are in DAR 48B.</note>
