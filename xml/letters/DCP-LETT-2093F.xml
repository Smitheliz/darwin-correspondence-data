            <p>Agrees with Thomas Henry Huxley that Albany Hancock has a good claim on a Royal Society medal. Thinks that geology has not been sufficiently honoured by the Royal Society, and suggests Joseph Prestwich. Expresses his strong opinion that Charles Lyell would be a worthy recipient of the Copley Medal.</p>

<p>I am most entirely of Huxley’s opinion that A. Hancock’s claims are of a very high order, &amp; I think he has done amply enough for a Royal medal even without the paper lately sent to the Society.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Supposing that no Botanist is brought forward with strong claims, I think it deserves notice that Geology has hardly, perhaps, been sufficiently noticed with honour by the Royal Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>.— I forget who are the geologists on the Council; but in my opinion a medal could not be bestowed better than on Prestwich for his excellent work in correlating the very difficult Tertiary strata of the S. England &amp; on the continent.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If I had been on council, I think I would have proposed him, &amp; in that case I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have got Lyell’s<ref target="#foot.f4"/> opinion &amp; judgment, as the most capable judge living on such a subject; &amp; I feel pretty sure he would show that my opinion was correct on the high value of Prestwich’s work.—</p>
<p>From what you say I presume the Copley certainly will not be given this year to any branch of the Natural Sciences, but as you are permanently attached to the Society, I may take this opportunity of expressing my very strong opinion on the claims of Lyell for the Copley Medal: I am aware that he had many years ago a Royal medal for the Principles, but I think the amount &amp; value of his various works would most amply justify the Copley.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It is my deliberate conviction that the future Historian of the Natural Sciences, will rank Lyell’s labours as more influential in the advancement of Science, than those of any other living man, let him be who he may; &amp; I do not think I am biassed by my old friendship for the man.—</p>
<p>Do bear this name in mind &amp; believe me | Dear Sharpey | Your’s sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>The way I try to judge of a man’s merit is to imagine what would have been the state of the Science if he had not lived; &amp; under this point of view I think no man ranks in the same class with Lyell. He has even powerfully affected certain departments of Zoology &amp; Botany,— Take as instance E. Forbes’ work.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
