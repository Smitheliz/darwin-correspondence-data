            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is established by the relationship between this letter and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10517F.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Francis Darwin, [31 May 1876]</ref>, which suggests that Francis last worked on teasel on Sunday; in 1876, the Sunday before 31 May was 28 May.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Johannes von Hanstein</ref> had suggested that resinous matter (named ‘metaplasm’ by him) was formed in the cells of glands from disintegrating protoplasm, and that this metaplasm was secreted from the cells by means of blister-like cavities that burst to allow accumulated matter to escape (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9277.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hanstein 1868</ref>, p. 775).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">After making his discovery that protoplasmic filaments protruded from the glandular hairs lining the cups of the common or fuller’s teasel (<hi rend="italic">Dipsacus sylvestris</hi>, now <hi rend="italic">D. fullonum</hi>), Francis argued that the secretion of resinous matter occurred while the resin still possessed some vitality, and not by means of blisters as Hanstein had suggested (see n. 2, above) but through the use of filaments (F. Darwin 1877b, pp. 247, 266–7). He noted that the bright red globules were resinous matter found in the glands of second-year leaves (but usually absent from the leaves of seedlings), and that the crust on the outside of the glands was also resinous (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 246 and 265). An amoeba was considered to be a small mass of undifferentiated protoplasm; a plasmodium consisted of several amoeboid cells fused together. The figures mentioned might refer to pencil sketches on the back of the letter, which were largely lost when the pages were cut down to include only the typed text. These observations were also included in F. Darwin 1877b, plate XIX, in which figure 7 is captioned, ‘Gland from specimen which had been mounted about a quarter of an hour previously, in <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> per cent. carbonate of ammonia. It shows the characteristic rounded masses of delicate transparent protoplasm which exhibit amoeboid movements’, and figure 2, ‘Gland bearing a long and stout filament’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_7538.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Johannes Reinke</ref> had observed that in many plants the tips of the serrations on the leaves bore glands that secreted only at a very early stage in the bud (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9145.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Reinke 1873</ref>, pp. 823–5; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8595.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Cross and self fertilisation</hi></ref>, p. 403, n.).</note>
