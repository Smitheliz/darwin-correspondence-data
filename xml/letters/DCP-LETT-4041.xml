            <p>Lyell has received compliments for letting readers draw own inferences [on species question]. Now feels he earlier did Lamarck injustice. [CD’s] substitution of variety-making power for volition [as in Lamarck] in some respects only a change of names.</p>
            <p>Thinks Huxley taking on too many responsibilities.</p>

                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>Your letter will be very useful. I wish to get such passages so far in the Darwinian direction as not to be inconsistent with my general tone, and what Hooker calls some of my original arguments in favour of natural selection.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> At the same time I am struck by the number of compliments, both in reviews and in conversation with the half-converted, which I receive, because I have left them to draw their own inferences, and have not told them dogmatically that they must turn round with me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Hooker admits that in science people do not like to be told too plainly that they must believe, though in religion they wish to have it laid down for them. Yet he may be wrong, for if the ‘Times’ were to write for the next fortnight against the Southern States, and against the Poles,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> nine-tenths of good society would whirl round, and the middle class which would stand firm would be able to do so partly because they read cheaper papers which are not interested in following the lead of the ‘Times.’ ....</p>
<p>I wish I deserved what you say about taking criticism kindly.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I often think I should be as touchy as anyone if the success of my works did not give me a constant opportunity of profiting immediately by every suggestion as to style and moral tone, and above all as to facts and logic.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Besides the increased responsibility which I incur by the trusting public, who before they had read a word induced the trade to bid for 3,850 copies, I have the prospect, if I improve my knowledge and my teaching, of future success in new editions with comparatively little labour.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>As to Lamarck I find that Grove, who has been reading him, is wonderfully struck with his book.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I remember that it was the conclusion he came to about man that fortified me thirty years ago against the great impression which his arguments at first made on my mind,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> all the greater because Constant Prévost, a pupil of Cuvier’s forty year ago, told me his conviction ‘that Cuvier thought species not real, but that science could not advance without assuming that they were so.’<ref target="#foot.f9"/> When I came to the conclusion that after all Lamarck was going to be shown to be right, that we must ‘go the whole orang,’ I re-read his book, and remembering when it was written, I felt I had done him injustice.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Even as to man’s gradual acquisition of more and more ideas, and then of speech slowly as the ideas multiplied, and then his persecution of the beings most nearly allied and competing with him—all this is very Darwinian.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>The substitution of the variety-making power for ‘volition,’ ‘muscular action,’ &amp;c. (and in plants even volition was not called in) is in some respects only a change of names.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Call a new variety a new creation, one may say of the former as of the latter, what you say when you observe that the creationist explains nothing, and only affirms ‘it is so because it is so.’</p>
<p>Lamarck’s belief in the slow changes in the organic and inorganic world in the year 1800, was surely above the standard of his times, and he was right about progression in the main, though you have vastly advanced that doctrine.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> As to Owen in his Aye Aye paper, he seems to me a disciple of Pouchet, who converted him at Rouen to ‘spontaneous generation.’<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Have I not at p. 412 put the vast distinction between you and Lamarck as to ‘necessary progression’ strongly enough?<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>Huxley’s second thousand is going off well.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> If he had leisure like you and me;—and the vigour and logic of the lectures, and his address to the Geological Society,<ref target="#foot.f17"/> and half a dozen other recent works (letters to the ‘Times’ on Darwin, &amp;c.),<ref target="#foot.f18"/> been all in one book, what a position he would occupy! I entreated him not to undertake the ‘Natural History Review’ before it began. The responsibility all falls on the man of chief energy and talent; it is a quarterly mischief, and will end in knocking him up.<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>I am sorry you have to go to Malvern.<ref target="#foot.f20"/> The good of the water-cure is abstinence from work; a tour abroad would do it, I am persuaded, as effectually and more profitably.</p>
<p>I hope my long letter will not task you too much; when I sit down to write to you, I can never stop. Hooker, not having heard from you, is growing anxious, and hopes it is because you are corresponding with me and not because of serious ill-health.<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>Ever affectionately yours, | Charles Lyell.</p>

Lamarck’s account of the origin of the higher mental faculties was particularly innovative in that it posited the progressive development of such faculties, linked to the structural development of the nervous system (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2160.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DSB</hi></ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12">Lamarck’s theory of species transmutation was based on two linked factors; namely, a natural tendency toward organic complexity, and the direct influence of the environment on the organism, causing heritable variations from this natural progression. In higher animals, however, Lamarck posited that there also existed a ‘sentiment intérieur [inner feeling]’, which, like the external environment, could affect the organism’s form. Lamarck argued that this feeling, corresponding to agitations of the nervous fluid, resulted in muscular motion that, through repetition, could create new organs (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2160.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DSB</hi></ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f13">Lamarck first publicly expounded his theory of transmutation in a preliminary discourse to his series of lectures on invertebrates at the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, in 1800; the discourse is reproduced in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4540.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Lamarck 1801</ref> (see also n. 12, above). In <hi rend="italic">Antiquity of man</hi>, Lyell introduced the section relating to theories of species transmutation and progression with a preliminary chapter that first described Lamarck’s theory, and then discussed subsequent debates (C. Lyell 1863a, pp. 385–406). Lyell had long been an outspoken critic of the progressivist palaeontology common in Britain during the mid-nineteenth century (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_400.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bartholomew 1976</ref>). For CD’s observations on progression, see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4038.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 12–13 March [1863]</ref>; see also n. 15, below, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 3, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-729.xml" resp="#automat">letter to J. D. Hooker [11 January 1844]</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f14">Lyell refers to Owen 1862c, in which Owen allegedly claimed the ‘whole credit of making out the derivation or origin of species’ (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4024.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 5 March [1863]</ref> and n. 19, and letters to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4028.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">6 March [1863]</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4038.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">12–13 March [1863]</ref>). In the paper, Owen committed himself to ‘creation by law’ while refusing to endorse any of the mechanisms currently proposed (Owen 1862c, p. 96). However, he gave most positive treatment to what he called the ‘derivative hypothesis’ of organisms, meaning the continual spontaneous generation and law-like transmutation of species, which, he considered, provided ‘a kind of vantage-ground artificially raised to expand the view of the outlooker for the road to truth’ (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 92 and n.). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3833.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Félix Archimède Pouchet</ref>, director of the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle at Rouen, was a prominent advocate of spontaneous generation and was involved in a major controversy on the subject with <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3707.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Louis Pasteur</ref> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Farley 1977</ref>). Owen had given Pouchet’s work qualified support on several occasions since 1859 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6790.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Rupke 1994</ref>, pp. 239–40, 251–2).

In C. Lyell 1863a, p. 412, Lyell observed: <quote type="quote"> One of the principal claims of Mr. Darwin’s theory to acceptance is, that it enables us to dispense with a law of progression as a necessary accompaniment of variation.
