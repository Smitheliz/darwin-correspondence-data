<p>I returned to College (from my Cathedral residence at Norwich) in time to assist at the <hi rend="underline">admission</hi> of the new Fellows.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I shook hands with them in our antechapel, not knowing the name of any one of them; &amp; little suspecting that your son was one of them.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I heard their names afterwards &amp; greatly rejoiced I was to find that the one who is junior on the list was your living representation, I tried to find him out, but he was gone; as I was told by a gyp.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Let me send you my warmest congratulations   And now I do hope that you will again sometimes come among us— All my old friends are dead, or have left the University— So that here I am living in solitude, for I cannot bear to go out to any parties— Considering my great age—for I am far advanced in the 84<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. year—I am in many respects a strong old fellow. Yet my organic machinery is sadly out of tune—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> —E.G. I have in my heart an indurated mitral valve, which makes all climbing impossible. 2. I have an enlarged prostate gland, which makes me unfit for society. (3) I have a stone in my right kidney &amp; 4<hi rend="superscript">thly</hi>. I am liable to dangerous attacks of giddiness, which sometimes fell me to the ground—as if I were shot thro’ the head— But these maladies (if I may so call them) have not increased during the last two or three years: &amp; after several irritating &amp; alarming struggles I have settled down into a kind new equilibrium among my animal functions— Do come down with a family party &amp; renew your acquaintance with Cambridge, &amp; the few old friends left in it—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> New friends you would find in plenty—</p>
<p>There! I have been slopping my ink so ’tis time for me to conclude. My eyes do not—without a higher power than I am using—allow me to read what I am writing</p>
<p>Again accept my congratulations &amp; believe me while my heart beats &amp; my lungs heave Ever yours in all christian truth and good will | A Sedgwick</p>
