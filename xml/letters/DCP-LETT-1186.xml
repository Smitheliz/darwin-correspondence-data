<p>I did not hear till after I saw you on Wednesday at the Council,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> of the wonderful escape Miss. S. Horner has had.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Emma wanted to write to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lyell to say how astonished &amp; shocked she had been at my account of what very little I knew; but she is poorly enough &amp; so I write to say how heartily we congratulate you all on her safety, but congratulation is not the proper word, for one feels that the risk has been too great &amp; dreadful.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Horner, I know, always had a horror of the sea &amp; now it is indeed justified.—</p>
<p>I was at the evening meeting but did not get within hail of you. What a fool (though I must say a very amusing one) Buckland did make of himself.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Your speech<ref target="#foot.f4"/> was refreshing after it &amp; was well characterised by Fox (my cousin)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> in three words “What a contrast”! That struck me as a capital speculation about the Wealden Continent<ref target="#foot.f6"/> going down. I did not hear what you settled at the Council; I was quite wearied out &amp; bewildered.</p>
<p>I find Smith of Jordan Hill has a much worse opinion of R. Chambers’ book than even I have.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Chambers has piqued me a little; he says I “propound” &amp; “profess my belief” that Glen Roy is marine &amp; that the idea was accepted because the “mobility of the land was the ascendant idea of the day”<ref target="#foot.f8"/> He adds some very faint <hi rend="underline">upper</hi> lines in Glen Spean, (seen, by the way, by Agassiz), &amp; has shown that Milne &amp; Kemp<ref target="#foot.f9"/> are right in there being horizontal aqueous markings (<hi rend="underline">not</hi> at coincident levels with those of Glen Roy)<ref target="#foot.f10"/> in other parts of Scotland, at great heights, &amp; he adds several other cases. This is the whole of his addition to the data. He not only takes my line of argument from the buttresses &amp; terraces below the lower shelf &amp; some other arguments, (without acknowledgment), but he sneers at all his predecessors not having perceived the importance of the short-portions of lines intermediate between the chief ones in Glen Roy, whereas I commence the description of them with saying, that “perceiving their importance I examined them with scrupulous care” &amp;c &amp; expatiate at considerable length on them.</p>
<p>I have indirectly told him I do not think he has quite claims to consider that he alone (which he pretty directly asserts) has solved the problem of Glen Roy.</p>
<p>With respect to the terraces at lower levels coincident in height all round Scotland &amp; England, I am inclined to believe he shows some little probability of there being some leading ones coincident, but much more exact evidence is required.— Would you believe it credible; he advances as a probable solution to account for the rise of Great Britain; that in some great ocean <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>20</mn></mfrac></math></formula> <hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of the bottom of the whole aqueous surface of the globe has sunk in (he does not say where he puts it) for a thickness of <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> a mile, &amp; this he has calculated would make an apparent rise of 130 feet.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> If he be, as I believe, the Author of the Vestiges this book for poverty of intellect is a literary curiosity.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have written all this, as I believe it may save you reading the Book: it is to the best of my Belief, an honest account.</p>
<p>My dear Lyell | Yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I shall be in London I trust, before you go, &amp; you must let me pay you a tea or breakfast call.</p>
