<p>I have been indolent, otherwise I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have thanked you heartily for taking trouble about getting me the 3 Hybrid pamphlets,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> which I received just before starting here for the sea for my daughter’s sake who improves a little.— And now I have to thank you for your pleasant &amp; useful note of July 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am now writing my Orchid paper &amp; am glad to hear what you say about Cypripedium<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; that you will have a look at Spiranthes:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> remember that you must look at flower just opened &amp; not visited by moth. I hope Hooker will send me an Arethusa.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am astonished at Drosera filiformis misbehaving: my experiments were all tried late in summer.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Did you expect a rapid or visible movement? that very rarely takes place: the <hi rend="underline">minutest</hi> atom of raw meat placed on a <hi rend="underline">single</hi> gland, <hi rend="underline">which is covered with viscid</hi> <hi rend="underline">secretion</hi>, shows motion best.— If gland is dry no movement takes place. I hope to finish my observations on Drosera this Autumn.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> From what I have seen of Cypripedium insigne my difficulty is to know what induces an insect to place its head so far back in flower:<ref target="#foot.f9"/> if you find many plants in flower watch for a little time for <hi rend="underline">bare</hi> chance of an insect’s visit.—</p>
<p>This diagram gives, as you know, the structure of the 2 forms of Primula;</p> 
<figure type="diagram"> 
<p>[DIAG HERE] Pistil Pistil anther</p> </figure> 
<p>now if you know of analogous cases, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be <hi rend="underline">particularly</hi> obliged if you would name them &amp; allow me to quote you:<ref target="#foot.f10"/> also, if they are hardy plants &amp; good seeders I would experiment on them.— I could not read one name given.—</p>
<p>How I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like half-an-hours conversation on Design: nothing else would make us quite understand each other.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> As no one has aided the subject of natural selection &amp; the knowledge of my Book so much as you, I must tell you what has pleased me much after the many attacks on me for neglecting “Induction” “Baconian philosophy” &amp;c. We in England think John Stuart Mill the highest authority on such subjects, &amp; he said lately to a friend, who wrote to me, as follows. “he considers that your reasoning throughout is in the most exact accordance with the strict principles of logic. He also says the method of investigation you have followed is the only one proper to such a subject.”—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> My wife’s remark on reading this, was “why you know nothing about Logic”.— Is it not (I mean Mill’s &amp; not my wife’s sayings) very satisfactory to me?—</p>
<p>I was very glad of your P.S. on the state of your country; one values a private note far more than a dozen public letters. After carefully reading Olmstead’s last Book I never doubted the North would conquer the South.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> But then what is to follow? From Olmstead &amp; Russell’s letters in Times,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I cannot believe that the South would ever have fellow-feeling enough with the North to allow of government in common. Could the North endure a Southern President? The whole affair is a great misfortune in the progress of the World; but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not regret it so much, if I could persuade myself that Slavery would be annihilated. But your president does not even mention the word in his Address.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I sometimes wish the contest to grow so desperate that the north would be led to declare freedom as a diversion against the Enemy. In 50 or 100 years your posterity would bless the act.— But Heaven knows why I trouble you with my speculations; I ought to stick to Orchids.</p>
<p>Hooker, I fear, is as usual overworking himself: I seldom hear from him. This place is charming; but I am not as idle, as I ought to be.</p>
<p>Farewell | My good &amp; kind friend | Yours most truly | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>I am trying to make out the good of two forms of Thyme.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>

For Gray’s response, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Asa Gray, 10 November 1862</ref>. Gray sent long notes in May 1862 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3595.xml">letter to Gray, 10–20 June [1862]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Gray’s observations of <hi rend="italic">Spiranthes gracilis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">S. cernua</hi> are mentioned in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, p. 123 n. When he came to review <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref> in 1862, Gray mentioned his examination of <hi rend="italic">Spiranthes</hi> and demurred somewhat to CD’s view of the implications of the flower’s structure (see A. Gray 1862, p. 427).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3210.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 17 [July 1861]</ref>. CD was unable to examine any ‘living flowers’ of the Arethuseae before the publication of his study (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, pp. 269–70).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD carried out many experiments on various species of <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> and other insectivorous plants during the summer of 1860 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 8); he continued to study these plants well into the next decade. His notes on the sensitivity of the leaf hairs to nitrogenous substances are in DAR 54, DAR 60.1, and DAR 60.2.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">For a description of the experiments CD had suggested Gray might carry out on <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi>, see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3064.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 17 February [1861]</ref>. Having given a preliminary report on his study of insectivorous plants to the Philosophical Club of the Royal Society in February 1861, CD hoped to complete his researches in the autumn and write a complete account. However, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4097.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Insectivorous plants</hi></ref> was not published until 1875. CD’s description of <hi rend="italic">D. filiformis</hi> is given on p. 281.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, pp. 270–6, CD described the morphology of the flower parts of <hi rend="italic">Cypripedium</hi>. This orchid is commonly known as the lady’s-slipper orchid owing to the slipper-like appearance of the lip or lower-most petal of the flower (the labellum). CD proposed, on the basis of inserting a bristle into the labellum and noting where the pollen adhered, the probable means whereby insects could effect self- or cross-fertilisation (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 274–6).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">CD intended to draw up an account of his study of heterostyly in primroses and other plant genera. His paper, ‘On the two forms, or dimorphic condition, in the species of <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi>, and on their remarkable sexual relations’, was read to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> in November 1861 and published the following year in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society (Botany)</hi> 6 (1862): 77–96. See also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 62. Gray supplied CD with a number of analogous cases included in this paper (see letters from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3242.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[27 and 29 August] and 2 September [1861]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3282.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">11 October 1861</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">CD and Gray had been corresponding over the past year about their differing views on natural selection and, in particular, whether such a mechanism could be reconciled with a belief in design in nature. In his pamphlet on this subject (A. Gray 1861a), Gray suggested that natural selection could be merged with natural theology if one assumed that variations were themselves ‘guided’ or ‘designed’. CD, however, told Gray that he himself could not ‘look at each separate thing as the result of Design’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 8, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2998.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 26 November [1860]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12"><ref target="./DCP-LETT-2868.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Letter from Henry Fawcett, 16 July [1861]</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f13"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5995.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Olmsted 1860</ref>. CD had read <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3592.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Frederick Law Olmsted’s</ref> <hi rend="italic">A journey in the back country</hi> late in 1860 and found it to be ‘a remarkably interesting Book.—’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 8, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2998.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 26 November [1860]</ref>). Olmsted was highly critical of Southern society, arguing that the system of slavery on which it was based led to an inefficient economic order as well as a morally corrupt social order. Further, he denigrated the ability of the South to defeat the North, basing his argument on the problems faced by the South with regard to its military strength and economic resources.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f14"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4132.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Howard Russell</ref> served as the special war correspondent for <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, contributing, beginning in April 1861, a regular column entitled ‘The Civil War in America’. Although <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> was sympathetic towards the Southern cause, Russell’s own sympathies were strongly with the North owing to his extreme opposition to the institution of slavery (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2063.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>). See also Brogan ed. 1975.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f15">In his address before a special session of the United States Congress on 4 July 1861, President <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2927.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Abraham Lincoln</ref> stated that the administration had no intention, either ‘directly or indirectly, to interfere with Slavery in the States where it exists.’ This position was consistent with the Republican platform in the election of 1860, which opposed on constitutional grounds the right of southern states to secede from the union, but did not seek to interfere with existing institutions in those states. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5147.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">McPherson 1988</ref>, p. 312.</note>
