                    <p>Emma will send you a book written by our Uncle Charles Darwin, &amp; which gained him a name as a <hi rend="underline">very</hi> clever &amp; promising young man. At the end, you will see a short account of his life. His Father D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin was <hi rend="underline">not</hi> with him at his death. There would not have been time in those days to get there. He felt his son’s death <hi rend="underline">most acutely</hi>, &amp; his friends said he never recovered it, but was a different man after. Charles was sent at that early age to France on account of his stammering as he never stammered when speaking french.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>When D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin married M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Pole, he left Lichfield, &amp; lived about two years at Radbourne, till her son M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Pole came of age, &amp; my Mother was born there also our Uncle Edward her elder Brother.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> They then lived in the Full St in Derby, &amp; the garden was just over the river Derwent, which they crossed in a ferry boat. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D. had all his children taught to swim when they were four years old, &amp; all were capital swimmers. My Mother twice saved a young friend’s life who was drowning in a swimming bath. I suppose you know that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D. never took wine, &amp; recommended all his Patients &amp; friends to abstain &amp; in my earlier days I can remember, among those of my Mothers standing, how few I knew in Derbyshire who took wine. I have seen some of my g<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>father’s letters. I think Reg<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Darwin must have lent them to us—they were clever, playful &amp; witty. Reg<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. has a sort of day book of his, which interested us, with cases of his patients, verses, remarks &amp;c<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>with kind remembrances | Yours very sincerely | E A Wheler</p>
                    <p>With regard to that tale about my g<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>father &amp; the Jockey I find he went to Margate to see my aunt in 1793 &amp; his fee was 100 guineas.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The month July.</p>
                    <p>Emma reminds me my g<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>father left Radbourne because of the inconvenience to his practice, that his step son was not then of age<ref target="#foot.f5"/>   She will like to have C Darwin’s book returned when you have <hi rend="underline">quite</hi> done with it.</p>
