<p>Sends MS of his chapter on geology for <hi rend="italic">Manual</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi> 1: 227–50]. Fears it may be too long. Does not much like it but can do no better. After hesitation, has recommended books. Defends his point that mere collection of rock specimens is "of hardly any use to Geology".</p>

                    <salute>Dear Sir John Herschel</salute>

                <div type="transcription">
<p>I received your note this morning &amp; forwarded it to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Mallet,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> who, I do not doubt, will undertake his task in the compressed form.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I enclose my M.S.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I much fear, from what you say of size of type that it will be too long; but I do not see how I could shorten it, except by rewriting it, &amp; that is a labour which would make me groan. I do not much like it, but I have in vain thought how to make it better. I should be grateful for any corrections or erasures on your part: should you not approve of it, you have my entire concurrence to send it to any other geologist for alteration.</p>
<p>I have felt particular doubt about the propriety of recommending Books, but have done so after much hesitation, on the advice of others.—</p>
<p>I do not know whether each chapter will have any heading: I have sent one, for the <hi rend="underline">chance</hi> of such being required.</p>
<p>If there be no objection, I should be glad, either before or after you have looked over the proofs, to be allowed to correct the press;: as my writing is often very incorrect.</p>
<p>If the request be not unreasonable, I should much like to have some few copies of my Chapter to send to friends, who have given me suggestions, &amp; to keep by me to give to any voyager, having previously sometimes had applications to that effect: I should be very glad, also, to have one copy of the entire volume.</p>
<p>Pray believe me | dear Sir John | Yours sincerely | C. Darwin <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> To | Sir J. W. Herschel. Bart.</p>
<p>P.S. You may possibly be surprised at my having expressed myself rather strongly, that the mere collecting rock-specimens is hardly of any use to Geology.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have for some years come deliberately to this opinion, in which some other geologists, with whom I have discussed the point, concur with me. I could specify several large collections lately brought home, which no one person would take the trouble even of looking at.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> This is very mortifying to the collector &amp; prevents him afterwards turning his attention to some other branch of Nat. Hist, in which mere collecting would be of service.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is based on CD’s completion of his chapter on geology for the Admiralty manual (Herschel ed. 1849). On 20 March 1848, CD recorded that the chapter was finished (‘Journal’; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Appendix I).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Possibly a reference to Mallet having dealt with the changes of level that often accompany earthquakes, a topic that CD also discussed in his chapter. Mallet may well have compressed or deleted some of his chapter, see Herschel ed. 1849, p. 227, in which the reader is referred to CD’s chapter on geology.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">The Geological Society was then holding several large collections of fossils and mineralogical specimens that were uncatalogued and consequently unavailable for research purposes.
