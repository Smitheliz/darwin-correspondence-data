<p>We the undersigned the principal inhabitants of the village of Down in Kent &amp; its neighbourhood, respectfully request your attention to the arrangement for the delivery our letters. Although but a small place we receive an average from 50 to 60 letters &amp; newspapers &amp;c. daily.— A letter posted by general post in London we receive not until after 9 oclock the next morning, which is almost too late to act on that day. But our chief grievance is that a letter written in any part of Great Britain (except a few places in the South), say on a Monday, is not delivered here till past 9 on the Wednesday morning; such letters lying 23 hours at Bromley, only six miles distant.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Our hopes for many months have been raised by constant reports of some improvement; but the present result &amp; only change is that the Down Postman delivers all letters in Farnborugh, &amp; our delivery has been delayed a full half-hour.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>By a change granted us a few years ago, our letters leave this place at one oclock, by which means they get to London in time to be sent out by the general post of the same day, &amp; are delivered within London on that night; we most earnestly pray that this arrangement may not be disturbed.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Hoping that you will consider our case favourably | Sir | Your obedient servants</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">There were fourteen members of the gentry listed under Down in the <hi rend="italic">Post Office directory of the six home counties</hi> for 1845, and six in 1851, including, at both dates, CD himself and John William Lubbock.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_6239.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Leader Maberley</ref> was secretary to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3828.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Post Office</ref> from 1836 to 1854 (<hi rend="italic">DNB</hi>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The beginning of the date range is suggested by known changes to the postal arrangements for Down and Farnborough in 1845 (see nn. 5 and 6, below). The end of the date range is suggested by the fact that, at the time of writing, letters posted to Down from outside London, and letters posted within London, were evidently arriving at Bromley at different times, the post from outside London being delivered too late for the morning dispatch to Down. ‘London and all letters’ were delivered to Bromley at the same time in 1851 (<hi rend="italic">Post Office directory of the six home counties</hi> 1845; see n. 4, below).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">From 1851 at the latest both the general post and the London post were being delivered to Bromley by the same mail. It appears that in 1845 London mail was being delivered separately. According to the <hi rend="italic">Post Office directory of the six home counties</hi> for 1845 and 1851, letters were arriving at Down at 8:00 <hi rend="smallCaps">A.M.</hi> during both these years. (<hi rend="italic">Post Office directory of the six home counties</hi> 1845, 1851.)</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">A foot-messenger was appointed in March 1845 to take letters to and from Bromley to Farnborough and Down (<hi rend="italic">Postmaster general’s minutes</hi>, vol. 81, minute 3376). CD is first known to have used Farnborough in his letterhead in 1846 (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 3, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-971.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, [May 1846]</ref>). Rowland Hill, as secretary to the postmaster-general from 1846, made repeated attempts to reform the postal service; these were consistently rejected by Maberley (<hi rend="italic">DNB</hi>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">An application was made in 1843 by the inhabitants of Down for mail to be collected early enough to reach Bromley in time for the twopenny post dispatch to London (<hi rend="italic">Postmaster general’s minutes</hi>, vol. 71, minute 2087). This may not have been put into immediate effect, as, according to the <hi rend="italic">Post Office directory of the six home counties</hi> 1845, mail was dispatched from Down at 2 <hi rend="smallCaps">P.M.</hi> It was dispatched at 1 <hi rend="smallCaps">P.M.</hi> in 1851.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">No final version of this petition has been found, and no reference to its receipt has been found in the <hi rend="italic">Postmaster general’s minutes</hi> between 1839 and 1865.</note>
