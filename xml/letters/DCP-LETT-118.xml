<p>Gloria in excelsis is the most moderate beginning I can think of.— Things are more prosperous than I should have thought possible.— Cap. Fitzroy is every thing that is delightful, if I was to praise half so much as I feel inclined, you would say it was absurd, only once seeing him.— I think he really wishes to have me.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> He offers me to mess with him &amp; he will take care I have such room as is possible.— But about the cases he says I must limit myself: but then he thinks like a sailor about size: Cap. Beaufort says I shall be upon the boards &amp; then it will only cost me like other officers.— Ship sails 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October: spends a week at Madeira islands: &amp; then Rio de Janeiro.— They all think most extremely probable, home by the Indian Archipelago: but till that is decided, I will not be so.—</p>
<p>What has induced Cap. Fitzroy to take a better view of the case is; that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Chester,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> who was going as a friend, cannot go: so that I shall have his place in every respect.— Cap Fitzroy has good stock of books,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> many of which were in my list, &amp; rifles &amp;c So that the outfit will be much less expensive than I supposed.— The vessel will be out 3 years I do not object, so that my Father does not.— On Wednesday I have another interview with Cap. Beaufort, &amp; on Sunday most likely go with Cap. Fitzroy to Plymouth.— So I hope you will keep on thinking on the subject, &amp; just keep memoranda of what may strike you.— I will call most probably on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Burchill<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; introduce myself.— I am in Lodgings at 17, Spring Gardens.—</p>
<p>You cannot imagine anything more pleasant, kind &amp; open than Cap. Fitzroys manners were to me.— I am sure it will be my fault, if we do not suit.—</p>
<p>What changes I have had: till one to day I was building castles in the air about hunting Foxes in Shropshire, now Lamas in S America.— There is indeed a tide in the affairs of men.— If you see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wood, remember me most kindly to him.—</p>
<p>Good bye, my dear Henslow | Yours most sincere friend | Chas Darwin</p>
<p>Excuse this letter in such a hurry.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The same evening <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1650.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Robert FitzRoy</ref> wrote his impressions of CD to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_348.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Beaufort</ref>: I have seen a good deal of Mr. Darwin, to-day having had nearly two hours’ conversation in the morning and having since dined with him. I like what I see and hear of him, much, and I now request that you will apply for him to accompany me as a Naturalist. I can and will make him comfortable on board, more so perhaps than you or he would expect, and I will contrive to stow away his goods and chattels of all kinds and give him a place for a workshop. Upon consideration, I feel confident that he will have a much wider field for his exertions than I was inclined to anticipate on Friday last; and should we even be disappointed, by giving me the means of discharging him from the Books, he might at any time return to England or follow his own inclinations in South America or elsewhere. (The original of this letter, once in the Hydrographer’s Office of the Admiralty, has been lost. The letter is quoted in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1800.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">F. Darwin 1912</ref>, p. 547.)</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-117.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Susan Darwin, [5 September 1831]</ref>, n. 1. H. F. Burstyn has suggested that the friend was <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_906.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Harry Chester</ref>, novelist and youngest son of Sir <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_908.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Robert Chester</ref>, who in 1831 was a clerk in the Privy Council Office (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1113.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Burstyn 1975</ref>, p. 66). An inscription in volume one of a copy of Kirby and Spence 1828 in the possession of David Kohn tends to confirm this |mns15| conjecture. It reads: ‘<ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_906.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Harry Chester</ref> | From his valued friend <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1650.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Robert FitzRoy</ref>’.</note>

CD undoubtedly wanted to see him because Burchell had explored and collected in Brazil from 1825 to 1830.
