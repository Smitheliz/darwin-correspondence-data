            <p>On evolution of language, CD doubts W. D. Whitney’s claim that changes are effected by the will of man. Asks CW when a thing may properly be said to be so effected.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your article in the N. American Review, which I have read with great interest.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Nothing can be clearer than the way in which you discuss the permanence or fixity of species.— It never occurred to me to suppose that anyone looked at the cases as it seems M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Mivart does. Had I read his answer to you,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> perhaps I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have perceived this; but I have resolved to waste no more time in reading reviews of my works or on evolution, excepting when I hear that they are good &amp; contain new matter, or are written by men whom I respect. It is pretty clear that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mivart has come to the end of his tether on this subject.—</p>
<p>As your mind is so clear, &amp; as you consider so carefully the meaning of words, I wish you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. take some incidental occasion to consider when a thing may properly be said to be effected by the will of man.— I have been led to the wish by reading an article by your Prof. Whitney versus Schleicher.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He argues because each step of change in language is made by the will of man, the whole language so changes; but I do not think that this is so, as man has no intention or wish to change the language. It is a parallel case with what I have called “unconscious selection” which depends on man consciously preserving the best individuals &amp; thus unconsciously altering the breed.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>My dear Sir | yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>

Schleicher had argued that languages were independent entities that developed organically through a mechanism which he likened to natural selection and which was independent of human agency. Whitney argued that language was a wholly human artefact, with its natural tendency to vary kept in check through acts of individual and collective will, whose development required ‘the will of man as a determining force’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8353.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Whitney 1871</ref>, p. 47); CD annotated this passage in his copy of the paper, ‘but without reflection on the result’.
