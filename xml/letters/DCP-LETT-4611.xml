<p>I have taken a long time to thank you for your pleasant &amp; most friendly note of July 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am not ungrateful, but I have less strength (though still gaining some &amp; now at last living down stairs) than formerly &amp; after my two hours work glad to be quite idle. I have little to say; for my soul has been absorbed with Climbing plants, now finished<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; tomorrow I begin again, after 13 months interruption on “Variation under domestication”.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I received lately a Review on H. Spencer with the address in your handwriting; I like much all the latter part; but surely you did not write it?<ref target="#foot.f5"/> If you did you had muddled your brains (in the first part) by reading metaphysics &amp; all elasticity had gone out of your style.— Oh, if you did write it, shall I not have some nice little stabs with your smooth dagger! I also before received a review on Dana,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I believe in your handwriting; &amp; this interested me considerably &amp; I thought it was perhaps by you.— I write now chiefly to say that I send by this paper a paper which has interested me greatly by a gardener John Scott;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> it seems to me a most remarkable production though written rather obscurely in parts, but worth the labour of studying.— I have just bethought me that for the chance of your noticing it in the Journal,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I will point out the new &amp; very remarkable facts.— I have paid the poor fellow passage out to India, where I hope he will succeed, as he is a most labourious &amp; able man, with the manners, almost of a gentleman.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>We are profoundly interested by your politics; &amp; do not in the least know whether the “old Bloody Times” is to be trusted that there will be peace &amp; that the middle States will join with the South on Slavery &amp; eject the northern states.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> In the latter case, I hope you will marry Canada, &amp; divorce England &amp; make a grand country, counterbalancing the devilish South—</p>
<p>Yours affectionately | Charles Darwin</p>

<p>p. 106–108. Red cowslip by variation has become non-dimorphic, &amp; with this change of structure has become much more productive of seed than even the heteromorphic union of the common cowslip.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>p. 91–92 similar case with Auricula— On other hand a non-dimorphic var. of P. farinosa (p. 115) is less fertile. These changes or variations in the generative system seem to me very remarkable.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>But far more remarkable is the fact that the Red Cowslip (p. 106–8) is very sterile when fertilising,, or fertilised by, the common cowslip. Here we have a new “physiological” species.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Analogous facts given (p. 98) on the crossing of Red &amp; White Primroses with common Primroses.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>It is very curious that the two forms of the same species (p. 93, 94, 95, &amp; p. 117) hybridise with extremely different degrees of facility with distinct species.—</p>
<p>He shows (p. 94) that sometimes a cross with a quite distinct species yields more seed than a homomorphic union with own pollen.</p>
<p>He shows (p. 111) that of the two homomorphic unions possible with each dimorphic species; that the short-styled, (as I stated) is the most sterile, &amp; that my explanation is probably true.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> There is good Summary to Paper.—<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>

Scott’s tabulated results (p. 106) suggested that the self-pollinated non-dimorphic red cowslip produced more seed, and was therefore likely to be more fertile, than the long-styled cowslip crossed with the short-styled cowslip (representing a ‘heteromorphic union’). Scott discussed the non-dimorphic cowslip in his letter of 21 May [1863], and enclosed seeds from this plant with his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4175.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter of [26 July – 2 August 1863]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 11).

On this view we can at once understand the good of the pollen of the short-styled form, relatively to its own stigma, being the most sterile; for this sterility would be the most requisite to check self-fertilization, or to favour intercrossing. </quote> In the short-styled form the anthers bearing the pollen are positioned above the stigma, making it more likely that pollen would fall on the plant’s own stigma than in the long-styled form, where the anthers are positioned below the stigma. CD had come to believe that most plants were adapted to promote the intercrossing of distinct individuals.</note>
