            <p>EAD thinks it a pity if CD does not go to Cambridge, but it will be very pleasant for them to be together at Edinburgh, where they should go as soon as possible and read. EAD is getting "case-hardened" in anatomy.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your letter    The examination<ref target="#foot.f1"/> turned out as I expected in one respect, but how in the name of heaven T.B<ref target="#foot.f2"/> came to be where he is I cant conceive.</p>
<p>You have I suppose by this time felt the good effects of Peiles schorlarship:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> has it turned the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>’<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> head?</p>
<p>I dont know whether to be sorry or glad about your Edinborough plans.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I think it is ten thousand pities if you do not come to Cambridge (wh. seems to be the case), &amp; I shall venture to add that it is a pity you leave school so soon, but to this latter doctrine you will hardly give credit. It will be very pleasant our being together, we shall be as cozy as possible, &amp; I almost think that when you have arrived at the dignity of a ‘Varsity’ man, that I shall leave of licking you. We shall have some good amusement in scheeming out our plans next summer, &amp; I shall vote setting off as soon as may be after your half-year finishes, for I suppose you wont return for the Quarter, &amp; there will be no earthly use staying at Shrewsbury, for it is out of the question reading there, the Lab on one hand, &amp; no room on the other, whereas if we get domiciled at E— — we can both read like horses that is to say if we like it, &amp; I must apropos, when &amp; where are you to graduate? but this I suppose you dont know.</p>
<p>I am getting a little case-hardening in anatomy; for yesterday seeing a body ex〈  〉 &amp; being Junior they gave me a 〈    〉 deal of the dirty work, &amp; I was not the least annoyed while an old Physician also present kept leaving the room perpetually. I dont fancy it w<hi rend="superscript">ld</hi>. have suited your stomack especially before breakfast—</p>
<p>Write to me again whether you have anything or nothing or both to say In the meantime good Bye | yours, E. D—</p>
