<p>I was very glad to get your letter this morning (to which I wrote brief answer), though it contained so melancholy an account of poor dear &amp; honoured Henslow.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> How strange &amp; pathetic an account you give of his mental state; &amp; how his kind feelings shine out.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He truly is a model to keep always before one’s eyes. How I wish his sufferings were closed in the long &amp; tranquil sleep of death. It must be very depressing to you, &amp; I am glad you can read &amp; think on other subjects.—</p>
<p>I quite agree with what you say on Lieut. Hutton’s Review (who he is, I know not):<ref target="#foot.f4"/> it struck me as very original: he is one of the very few who see that the change of species cannot be directly proved &amp; that the doctrine must sink or swim according as it groups &amp; explains phenomena. It is really curious how few judge it in this way, which is clearly the right way. I have been much interested by Bentham’s paper in N.H.R;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> but it would not of course from familiarity strike you, as it did me. I liked the whole,—all the facts on the nature of close &amp; varying species. Good Heavens to think of the British Botanists turning up their noses &amp; saying that he knows nothing of British plants!<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I was, also, pleased at his remarks on classification, because it showed me that I wrote truly on this subject in the Origin.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I saw Bentham at Linn. Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. &amp; had some talk with him &amp; Lubbock &amp; Edgeworth, Wallich several others.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I asked Bentham to give us his ideas of species: whether partially with us or dead against us, he would write <hi rend="underline">excellent</hi> matter. He made no answer, but his manner made me think he might do so, if urged; so do you attack him.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Everyone was speaking with affection &amp; anxiety of Henslow.—</p>
<p>I dined with Bell at Linn. Club,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> &amp; liked my dinner: though it must be confessed they are rather a poor set of muffs, &amp; I sat by the muffiest, viz Miers.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> But dining out is such a novelty to me that I enjoyed it. Bell has a real good heart.— I liked Rolleston’s paper, but I never read anything so obscure &amp; not self-evident as his “cannons”.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I had a dim perception of the truth of your profound remark, that he wrote in fear &amp; trembling “of God, man &amp; monkeys”, but I would alter it into God, man, Owen &amp; monkeys.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Huxley’s letter was truculent &amp; I see that everyone thinks it too truculent;<ref target="#foot.f14"/> but in simple truth I am become quite demoniacal about Owen, worse than Huxley, &amp; I told Huxley that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. put myself under his care to be rendered milder.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> But I mean to try to get more angelic in my feelings; yet I never shall forget his cordial shake of the hand when he was writing as spitefully as he possibly could against me.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> But I have always thought you have more cause than I to be demoniacally inclined towards him.—<ref target="#foot.f17"/> Bell told me that Owen says that the Editor mutilated his article in Edinburgh R.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> &amp; Bell seemed to think it was rendered more spiteful by Editor; perhaps the opposite view is as probable: Oh dear this does not look like becoming more angelic in my temper.</p>
<p>I had splendid long talk with Lyell (you may guess how splendid, for he was many times on his knees with elbows on sofa &amp; rump high in air) on his work in France: he seems to have done capital work in making out age of the celt-bearing beds; but the case gets more &amp; more complicated. All, however, tends to greater &amp; greater antiquity of man. The shingle beds seem to be estuary deposits.—<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>I called on R. Chambers at his very nice house in St John’s wood &amp; had very pleasant half-hour’s talk:<ref target="#foot.f20"/> he is really a capital fellow. He made one good remark &amp; chuckled over it, that the Laymen universally had treated the controversy on the Essays &amp; Review, as a merely professional subject &amp; had not joined in it, but had left it to the Clergy.—<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>I shall be anxious for your next letter about Henslow.</p>
<p>Farewell with sincere sympathy | My old friend | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. We are very much obliged for London R.<ref target="#foot.f22"/> We like reading much of it, &amp; the science is incomparably better than in Athenæum. You shall not go on very long sending it, as you will be ruined by pennies &amp; trouble. But I am under a horrid spell to the Athenæum &amp; Gardeners Chron, both of which are intolerably dull, but I have taken them in for so many years, that I <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> give them up. The Cottage Gardener for my purpose is now far better than G. Chronicle<ref target="#foot.f23"/></p>

Although it was stated that the paper was extracted from one read before the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> of London on 15 November 1858, Bentham later related to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1222.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Darwin</ref> a slightly different account of its history (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4842.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">LL</hi></ref> 2: 294): <quote type="quote"> On the day that [CD’s and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4935.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Russel Wallace’s</ref>] celebrated paper was read at the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref>, July 1st, 1858, a long paper of mine had been set down for reading, in which, in commenting on the British Flora, I had collected a number of observations and facts illustrating what I then believed to be a fixity of species, however difficult it might be to assign their limits … Most fortunately my paper had to give way to Mr. Darwin’s, and when once that was read, I felt bound to defer mine for reconsideration; I began to entertain doubts on the subject, and on the appearance of the ‘Origin of Species,’ I was forced, however reluctantly, to give up my long-cherished convictions, the results of much labour and study, and I cancelled all that part of my paper which urged original fixity, and published only portions of the remainder in another form, chiefly in the ‘<ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3490.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Natural History Review</ref>.’ </quote> In a note appended to his copy of this issue in the Darwin Library–CUL, CD wrote: ‘Bentham on Classification   Excellent’.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Bentham held the view, as did CD, that classification was a matter of convention. In Bentham 1861a, p. 133, Bentham wrote: <quote type="quote"> in nature there are no two individuals exactly alike in every respect. In all collections of individuals even when the immediate offspring of one parent, peculiarities will be found common to some and not to all. The species or collection of individuals thus defined, becomes, therefore, as arbitrary as the genus or collection of species, and reduces the rules of classification in the one case, as in the other, to little more than rules of convenience. </quote></note>
