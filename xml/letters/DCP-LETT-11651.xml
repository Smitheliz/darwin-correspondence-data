Thank God that the paralysis after diptheria is not, as you say, permanent.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> What an extraordinary physiological fact it is that the poison should so long afterwards bring on such serious evil consequences.— It seems in this respect like scarlet fever; &amp; we know how serious are the secondary symptoms of this accursed fever.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Very many &amp; true thanks for your congratulations: I cannot say that I care sixpence for my election, but the sympathy of a few friends on the occasion has been very dear to me.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> It is funny the Academy having elected a man as Corr: member in Botany, who does not know the characters of a single natural order!<ref target="#foot.f5"/> We are out for holidays, which to me is very serious work, for 3 weeks at the Houses of several relations; &amp; tomorrow we go to Abinger &amp; on the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>, thank Heaven back to Down &amp; work.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
