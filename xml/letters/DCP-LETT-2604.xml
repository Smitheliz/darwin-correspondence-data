<p>His book [<hi rend="italic">Origin</hi>] is a success "in the ordinary sense" – has had to reprint another 3000 copies.</p>

<p>I wish you as happy a Christmas as you deserve &amp; I am sure that ought to be a very happy one.— Fifteen round the Fire in your room,—I never before realised what a party you are!<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I fear you cannot say much good about yourself, as you do not say it, &amp; seem to have gone about so little in London.— We returned home last Friday fortnight. The last 10 days at Ilkley, I was splendidly well &amp; for the first week at home; but since then I have had as bad a week as man could well have with incessant discomfort, I may say misery.— I have necessarily been very busy during these weeks but not with work which would be any strain to any other mortal man. I was hardly able from lameness, Boils &amp;c to give Water-cure a fair trial this time, but I think we shall go there again next early summer.</p>
<p>My Book has been very successful in the ordinary sense; &amp; I have had to reprint with few corrections a new Edit of 3000 copies. Kingsley has permitted me to print a good sentence on the theological bearing of my work.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The Book has already made a few enthusiastic &amp; first-rate converts, viz Lyell, Hooker, Huxley, Carpenter &amp;c.— It will, I find, attract some little attention abroad. I daresay parts may be fanciful &amp; I look at it as certain that there will be a large amount of error, though I cannot as yet see such errors.—</p>
<p>I am going soon to begin my bigger book, which I shall publish as 3 separate volumes, with distinct titles, but with a general title in addition.— I think this will make the work less hard labour.— Here is an egotistical note for you my dear old friend.—</p>
