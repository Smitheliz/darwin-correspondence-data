<p>Permit me to awaken your feminine sympathies in behalf of a very admirable young lady &amp; dear friend of ours Miss Elizabeth Garrett who has, after encountering an amount of opposition which few men would have had the courage to encounter, succeeded in obtaining the diploma of the Apothecaries Company, &amp; has started in practice—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Your brother in law M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erasmus Darwin is Chairman of the Council of the Bedford College for Girls<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; Miss Garrett is a candidate for their Professorship of physiology applications for which are to go in on Wednesday next— I have no doubt that if a properly qualified lady can be obtained that the council would be disposed to consider her as possessing many advantages for instructing girls, especially in that particular branch—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I cannot of course ask you to urge the claims of one who is a stranger to you—but if you could say to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Erasmus Darwin that you believe that my recommendation would not be lightly given and that I have had the opportunity of watching Miss Garretts career closely &amp; of frequently observing &amp; testing her scientific acquirements and know them to be of a high order—&amp; also that her industry &amp; zeal are beyond all praise, I think possibly that even at second hand such testimony might do her good service— She is frequently at our house &amp; my wife<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; I both entertain the greatest regard for her—</p>
<p>I may add what I know will interest you although it cannot help her in the matter now under consideration, viz that the very special career to which she has devoted herself has nothing impaired the charm of her manner or her social converse   she is neither masculine nor pedantic &amp; except you knew her intimately you would only recognise a well bred English Lady— I hope you will be able to give me a more favorable account of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin than the last.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> pray remember us both most kindly to him—</p>
<p>Yours very truly | E Cresy <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Elizabeth Garrett received a licence to practise medicine from the Society of Apothecaries in September 1865, and began a private consultancy in London shortly after (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5207.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Manton 1965</ref>, pp. 115–18). The Society of Apothecaries was the only medical organisation whose charter did not prohibit the admittance of women. Although Garrett was accepted as an apprentice by the society in 1861, she later threatened legal action when the society’s Court of Examiners refused to let her sit for the licensing examination. Garrett had already experienced difficulties obtaining the clinical hours and lecture courses that were required for the medical certificate, because many universities and hospital schools refused to admit her as a student (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 112–68).</note>
