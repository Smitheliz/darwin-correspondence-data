            <p>Sends congratulations and a teapot on the occasion of JT’s engagement.</p>
            <p>Is pleased JT is not giving up on the spontaneous generation question. Feels strongly that subject will not be clear until it is understood how J. S. Burdon Sanderson and others succeeded in getting bacteria in infusions they had boiled for a long time.</p>

<p>I called on you this morning to thank you for writing to me, &amp; to say that I do not believe any of your friends can rejoice more heartily than I do, at the great news in your note.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> No man knows what happiness is till he has a dear, good wife to love by day &amp; by night, &amp; the longer he lives the more he feels &amp; understands this happiness.</p>
<p>And now I want to beg you &amp; the future M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Tyndall to accept a teapot &amp;c (which will be sent tomorrow) as a small token of my hearty admiration &amp; friendship for you.— I hope that you may enjoy peace &amp; joy, &amp; work hard at science, for many &amp; many a year to come.</p>
<p>Believe me | My dear Tyndall | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>It has occurred to me that I may have chosen things which you already possess: if so pray exchange them at M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Thomas 153 New Bond St.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; get whatever you like, &amp; I am sure that you will keep something as a remembrance of me.—</p>
<p>P.S. I am particularly glad that you are not going to give up at once the spont. generation question.— I do not care much about what D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bastian says, but I feel <hi rend="underline">very strongly</hi> that the whole subject is not made clear until some light is thrown on the question how men like Burdon Sanderson &amp; Wyman of Boston &amp; D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Child often succeeded in getting bacteria in infusions which they had boiled for a long time.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Do for Heaven sake complete as far as possible your beautiful work.</p>
<p>C.D</p>
<p>I have as yet read only the first part in Nature.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
