<p>Dear Cresy</p>
<p>Thank you much for your most interesting note. I have ordered a Chemical News.—   I particularly beg you to give D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. A. Taylor my cordial thanks for his note full of valuable suggestions.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> After writing out the greater part of my paper on Drosera, I thought of so many points to try and I wished to re-test the basis of one large set of experiments, namely to feel still more sure than I am, that drop of plain water <hi rend="underline">never</hi> produces any effect, that I have resolved to publish nothing this year.— For I found in record of my daily experiments one suspicious case.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I must wait till next summer. It will be difficult to try any solid substance containing nitrogen, such as ivory; for two quite distinct causes excite the movement, namely mechanical irritation and presence of nitrogen. When a solid substance is placed on leaf it becomes clasped, but is released sooner than when a nitrogenous solid is clasped; yet it is difficult (except with raw meat and flies) to be sure of the result owing to differences in vigour of different plants. The last experiments which I tried before my plants became too languid are very curious, and were tried by putting microscopical atoms on the gland itself of single hairs; and it is perfectly evident that an atom of human hair <hi rend="superscript">1/76,000</hi> of a grain (as ascertained by weighing a length of hair)<ref target="#foot.f4"/> in weight, causes conspicuous movement. I do not believe (for atoms of cotton thread acted) it is the chemical nature; and some reasons make me doubt whether it is actual weight; it is not the shadow and I am at present, after many experiments, confounded to know what the cause is. That these atoms did really act and alter the state of the contents of all the cells in the glandular hair, which moved, was <hi rend="underline">perfectly</hi> clear. But I hope next summer to make out a good deal more.—</p>
<p>I have been much interested by your account of your discussion, and I thank you as a bold and true Defender of the Faith.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It is very interesting to hear of such discussions going on in London on scientific questions out of the regular Societies. I am much pleased at all that you tell me. The article in National is by Carpenter.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am pleased that you were struck by the “Snakes” in Huxley’s article; it seemed capital to me.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Bree is nobody scientifically. His book is a mass of misrepresentations and blunders.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> By far, in my opinion, the best Review is by Asa Gray in Atlantic Monthly in U. States.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> If you cared to see it, I could lend it you. I am very hard at work in preparing a corrected Edit. of the Origin (for Murray sold at sale 400 more copies than he has). I shall not allude to any Reviews, but so far profit as to expand where I have been most misunderstood, and add several considerable discussions on points which I formerly ought to have noticed. I will send you a copy when it is out.</p>
<p>Thanks for advice about transitional cases. Excuse this rather hurried note, and with cordial thanks for all your great kindness</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>My daughter <hi rend="underline">very slowly</hi>, but steadily improves in health.</p>
