<p>I have been extremely much pleased by your letter, and I take it as a very great compliment that you should have written to me at such length. I have been much interested by many of your details, though I regret greatly that I did not know your facts about the varieties of the ass, kidney-bean &amp; artichoke before I published. Many thanks also for your references, but it is a great drawback to me that I have not strength to read nearly as much as I should wish.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I am glad to hear what you say about wheat, though I did not know that you believed it to be a descendant of Ægilops.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am not at all surprised that you cannot digest Pangenesis; it is enough to give any one an indigestion; but to my mind the idea has been an <hi rend="underline">immense</hi> relief, as I could not endure to keep so many large classes of facts all floating loose in my mind without some thread of connection to tie them together in a tangible method.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>With respect to the men who have recently written on the crossing of Plants, I can at present remember only Hildebrand   Fritz Müller   Delpino &amp; G. Henslow; but I think there are others.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I feel sure that Hildebrand’s is a very good observer, for I have read all his papers &amp; during the last 20 years I have made unpublished observations on <hi rend="underline">many</hi> of the plants which he describes. Most of the criticisms which I sometimes meet with in French works against the frequency of crossing I am certain are the result of mere ignorance.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have never hitherto found the rule to fail that when an author describes the structure of a flower as a specially adapted for self-fertilization, it is really adapted for crossing. The Fumariaceæ offer a good instance of this, &amp; Treviranus threw this order at my teeth, but in Corydalis Hildebrand shows how utterly false the idea of self fertilisation is.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> This author’s paper on Salvia is really worth reading &amp; I have observed some species &amp; know that he is accurate.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Judging from a long review in the Bot. Zeitung &amp; from what I know of some of the plants I believe Delpino’s article especially on the Apocyneæ is excellent: but I cannot read Italian.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Perhaps you would like just to glance at such pamphlets as I can lay my hand on, &amp; therefore I will send them as if you do not care to see them, you can return them at once; &amp; this will cause you less trouble than writing to say you do not care to see them.</p>
<p>With respect to the Primulas the one point about which I feel positive is that the Bardfield &amp; common oxslips are fundamentally distinct plants, &amp; that the common oxslip is a sterile hybrid.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have never heard of the <hi rend="underline">common</hi> oxslip being found in great abundance anywhere; &amp; some amount of difference in number might depend on so small a circumstance as the presence of some moth which habitually sucked the primrose &amp; cowslip.</p>
<p>To return to the subject of crossing; I am experimenting on a very large scale on the difference in power of growth between plants raised from self fertilised &amp; crossed seeds; and it is no exaggeration to say that the difference in growth &amp; vigour is sometimes truly wonderful.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Lyell, Huxley &amp; Hooker<ref target="#foot.f11"/> have seen some of my plants &amp; been astonished; &amp; I should much like to show them to you. I always supposed until lately that no evil effects w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be visible until after several generations of self fertilisation; but now I see that one generation sometimes suffices; &amp; the existence of dimorphic plants &amp; all the wonderful contrivances of orchids are quite intelligible to me.</p>
<p>With cordial thanks for your letter which has pleased me greatly | Your’s very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I heard some time ago from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hildebrand that he had succeeded in making a graft-hybrid, &amp; I inserted this in the Reprint of my last book.— He will publish an account in Bot. Zeitung.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Tubers produced from buds of one kind inserted into a distinct kind, were hybridised or intermediate in characters. This seems to me a most important fact for any theory of generation, &amp; supports Pangenesis.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I am a firm believer &amp; worshipper of my God Pan, &amp; am convinced that all hereticks some day will be converted; but you hereticks are at present terribly numerous.—</p>
