<p>I have a German paper for you from Grisebach on the Geog. Distrib of W. Indian plants,<ref target="#foot.f2"/>** very long, also a small bottle from Thwaites with some things I forget what.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I shall send them with <hi rend="underline">Strelitzia.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I cannot recollect any news for you, worth sending.— We have been much occupied of late with Garden Reform, we have been robbed much by our own people, &amp; I am putting the whole establishment on a different footing, discharged two foremen—dismissed half a dozen gardeners &amp; labourers &amp; clapped one fellow in jail for 6 months. All this is not very agreeable work, but we have really a first rate Curator now, &amp; I am anxious to put every-thing straight for him to go on without troubling me.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I am very proud of having picked him up. We have purchased £70 worth of orchids to make up our shameful losses, besides a great many other plants;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; I am actively corresponding abroad for new plants &amp;c.</p>
<p>I have been living a long while on the gratification of my last visit to Down.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Yesterday we had one of our “small club” dinners, in Albemarle Street, Lubbock, Huxley, Spottiswood, Spenser, Busk &amp; self,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> with Colenso<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; H B Wilson<ref target="#foot.f10"/> as guests, &amp; a very pleasant evening it was: though I must confess I cannot go along with Colenso— his incessant prating about his own “affair” is quite wearisome: he really is in some respects a very weak man. On first coming in, he asked the name of our club— I said it has none— he replied, “I would call it the Zulu club”. <hi rend="underline">&amp; so on.</hi>—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> then he told us that they have witheld his salary &amp;c. I thought Wilson a very superior man.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I am concerned about Lubbock, his wife seems really to be very ill, &amp; in a bad way<ref target="#foot.f13"/>—&amp; he is going into Parliament<ref target="#foot.f14"/>—for which I am no less sorry— I grudge so good a man from Science—&amp; have a presentiment that it will inaugurate a very trying life for him. I believe I am no end of way happier in avoiding every avenue to ambitious ends in my small walk of life—&amp; so long as one’s mind &amp; time is fully occupied, there is nothing to regret in a life of mere drudgery. We (L &amp; I) talk of going to Maidstone from Thursday to Monday but what with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> L<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. health &amp; my father being in bed with Influenza,<ref target="#foot.f15"/> it may not come off at all!</p>
<p>I have actually stuck for want of something to say to you!—</p>
<p>Saturday Mg.</p>
<p>Yours of 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. just arrived   I send the Bot: Zeit: on Monday with the other things.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>Thwaites &amp; Christy &amp; G. Gray are chosen for R. S.<ref target="#foot.f17"/>   I do not know of anyone else we know. or care about.</p>
<p>I have written to Busk being utterly ashamed of always <hi rend="underline">forgetting</hi> to ask him.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>Ever Yrs affec | J D Hooker</p>
<p>**Thomson<ref target="#foot.f19"/> is digging out its essence so do not trouble to read it yet.</p>

In response to Colenso’s questioning of church doctrine, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1961.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Robert Gray</ref>, the bishop of Cape Town, tried him, found him guilty of erroneous teaching, and deposed him in 1863. Using the secular courts, Colenso defended his position within the Anglican Church and his right to publish his opinions. On 20 March 1865 Colenso won his appeal against his deposition and he later returned to his diocese; however, Gray refused to reinstate him (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3223.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Guy 1983</ref>, pp. 95, 122–144). Hooker and CD had supported Colenso’s right to freedom of opinion and in 1864 had contributed to his defence funds.
