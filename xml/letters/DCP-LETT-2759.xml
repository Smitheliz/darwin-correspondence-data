<p>I thank you very sincerely for your two kind notes. The next time you write to your Father I beg you to give him from me my best thanks, but I am sorry that he should have had the trouble of writing when ill. I have been much interested by the facts given by him.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> If you think he would in the least care to hear the result of an artificial cross of two Sweet Peas; you can send the enclosed;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> if it will only trouble him, tear it up. There seems to me so much parallelism in the kind of variation from my experiment which was certainly a cross and what M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Masters has observed, that I cannot help suspecting that his Peas were crossed by Bees, which I have seen well dusted with the pollen of the Sweet Pea; but then I wish this, and how hard it is to prevent one’s wish biassing one’s judgment!</p>
<p>I was struck with your remark about the Compositæ &amp;c.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I do not see that it bears much against me, and whether it does or not is of course of not the slightest importance. Although I fully agree that no definition can be drawn between monstrosities and slight variations (such as my theory requires) yet I suspect there is some distinction. Some facts lead me to think that monstrosities supervene generally at an early age; and after attending to the subject I have great doubts whether species in a state of nature ever become modified by such sudden jumps, as would result from the natural selection of monstrosities. You cannot do me a greater service than by pointing out errors. I sincerely hope that your work on monstrosities will soon appear, for I am sure it will be highly instructive.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Now for your notes, for which let me again thank you.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>(1) Your conclusion about parts developed &amp;c. &amp;c: not being extra variable agrees with Hooker’s: You will see that I have stated that the rule apparently does not hold with plants, though it <hi rend="underline">ought</hi>, if true, to hold good with them.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>(2) I cannot now remember in what work I saw the statement about Peloria affecting the axis;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> but I know it was one which I thought might be trusted. I consulted also D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Falconer<ref target="#foot.f9"/> and I think that he agreed to the truth of it; but I cannot now tell where to look for my notes.— I had been much struck with finding a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Laburnum</hi> tree with the terminal flowers alone in each raceme peloric though not perfectly regular.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> The <hi rend="underline">Pelargonium</hi> case in the “Origin” seems to point in the same direction.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>(3) Thanks for the correction about furze; I found the seedlings just sprouting, and was so much surprised at their appearance that I sent them to Hooker; but I never plainly asked myself whether they were cotyledons or first leaves.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>(4) That is a curious fact about the seeds of the furze,—the more curious as I found with some Leguminosæ that immersion in plain cold water for a very few days killed some kinds.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>If at any time anything should occur to you illustrating or opposing my notions, and you have leisure to inform me, I should be truly grateful, for I can plainly see that you have wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours truly obliged | C. Darwin</p>
<p>With respect to advancement or retrogression in organisation in monstrosities of the Compositæ &amp;c. do you not find it very difficult to define which is which.</p>
<p>Anyhow most Botanists seem to differ as widely as possible on this head.</p>

<p>April 13 1860   to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Masters</p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">del</hi> ‘The’] I know the 6 kinds of Sweet Peas named by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Masters. I castrated 2 flowers of the <hi rend="italic">Purple</hi> &amp; fertilised with pollen of <hi rend="italic">Painted Lady</hi>: one pod produced seedlings [<hi rend="italic">interl</hi>] <hi rend="italic">all</hi> closely [<hi rend="italic">interl</hi>] like the Painted Lady; the other had produced some [<hi rend="italic">above del</hi> ‘one’ <hi rend="italic">pencil</hi>] plants [' <hi rend="italic">added pencil</hi>] not distinguished from the mother or Purple, &amp; [<hi rend="italic">above del</hi> ‘all’] the other peas <hi rend="italic">in the</hi> [<hi rend="italic">interl</hi>] <hi rend="italic">same pod</hi> produced plants like Painted Lady. The early flowers were indistinguishable from *those of [<hi rend="italic">interl</hi>] the Painted Lady; but later in season the wing-petals became slightly streaked &amp; blotched with *dark or pale [<hi rend="italic">above del</hi> ‘pale purplish’] Pink.—</p>
<p>I raised <hi rend="italic">many</hi> [<hi rend="italic">del</hi> ‘grandchild’] children from these latter mongrels (ie grandchildren of the Purple ♀ Painted Lady ♂) &amp; one single plant most closely resembled the Purple with a mere [<hi rend="italic">interl</hi>] <hi rend="italic">trace</hi> of paler streaks on the [<hi rend="italic"> interl</hi>] patch.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> All the other <hi rend="italic">many</hi> plants were *more or less intermediate between the [<hi rend="italic">interl above del</hi> ‘like’] Painted Lady, *&amp; Scarlet in tint, but were all more or less [<hi rend="italic">interl above del</hi> ‘but varying in intensity of colour &amp; more or less blotched’] blotched &amp; streaked [<hi rend="italic">del</hi> but none [<hi rend="italic">del</hi> ‘were’] had any purple on them.—'] with darker or lighter pink, but not with true purple.— see p. 69 for gr. grandchildren</p></note>
