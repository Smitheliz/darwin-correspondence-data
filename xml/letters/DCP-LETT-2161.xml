<p>I was very glad to get your note with a very fairly good account of yourself.— I cannot say much for myself; I have had a poor summer, &amp; am at last rather come to your theory that my Brains were not made for thinking, for twice I staid for a fortnight at Moor Park,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; was so extraordinarily better that I can attribute the difference, (&amp; I fell back into my old state <hi rend="underline">immediately</hi> I returned) to nothing but to mental work; &amp; I cannot attribute the difference but in a very secondary degree to Hydropathy. Moor Park, I like <hi rend="underline">much</hi> better <hi rend="underline">as a place</hi> than Malvern;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; I like D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lane very much: by the way have you seen his Brochure on Hydropathy;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> it seem to me very good &amp; worth reading. Unfortunately for me, I believe D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. L. means to look out for some new place.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>We have had Etty there all summer; but she comes home for good next Saturday.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> She has received much benefit, I think, from Hydropathy; but can walk very little &amp; is still very feeble. For the last month or two we have had trouble about Lenny, who has been the picture of strength &amp; vigour, &amp; now his pulse has become feeble &amp; often very irregular like three of our other children:<ref target="#foot.f7"/> it is strange &amp; heart-breaking. A man ought to be a bachelor, &amp; care for no human being to be happy! or not to be wretched.</p>
<p>I make slow progress in my work, which is altogether too much for me; I have done only 2 chapters in rough, first copy during the last six months!<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I see you ask about M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pritchards school: I have <hi rend="underline">nothing</hi> to say against it; but were it not for the great advantage of having George home on monthly Sundays, &amp; <hi rend="underline">short</hi> Michaelmas &amp; Easter holidays; I think I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. prefer Rugby; but if you ask me why, I declare I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. give no answer.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>You ask about all my Sisters &amp; Eras: all are much as usual: Catherine is thinking of taking a house in London &amp; living there at least during greater part of year, but I do not know how it will answer.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>How you have been spinning all about the English world: we have been all fixture, except Moor Park.— We have, however, been recreating ourselves with building a new Dining Room &amp; large bedroom over it; for we found our party, when we had cousins had quite outgrown our old room.— <hi rend="underline">Your</hi> Pear-trees have born very well this year for the first time; &amp; we had lots on the wall;<ref target="#foot.f11"/> &amp; pretty well off for Plums; but no other fruit succeeds with us. Louise Bonne &amp; Marie Louise have been splendid. Not only have we been nowhere; but we have hardly had any visitors, except Henslow for 2 or 3 days;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; he was, all what he always is,—than which I cannot give higher praise.— I am very glad your children are flourishing.</p>
<p>My dear Fox | Yours affectionately | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Emma desires her very kind remembrances.</p>
