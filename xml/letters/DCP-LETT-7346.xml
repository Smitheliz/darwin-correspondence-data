<p>I enclose cheque for 115£:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I expected of course to have to aid you as you were so much longer than usual at Cambridge, but the above is rather more than I expected; &amp; what is worse I do not see how you can hold out for this quarter with only £46<hi rend="superscript">.</hi>5<hi rend="superscript">.</hi>0.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But never, for God’s sake, conceal debts from me, &amp; tell me now, whether you owe any more: tell me this &amp; think deliberately when you acknowledge the cheque to Down, where we return on Thursday morning.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>As you have not kept accounts it is of course impossible for you know how you have overspent your income.— Let me urge you to make a point of conscience (&amp; then I know it will be done, i.e. if I can persuade you that it is a duty) to keep accounts.— You cannot be sure about paying your debts if you do not, nor can you tell how to economise &amp; spend your income to best advantage. I have never known a man who was too idle to attend to his affairs &amp; accounts, who did not get into difficulties; &amp; he who habitually is in money difficulties, very rarely keeps scrupulously honourable, &amp; God forbid that this sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. ever be your fate.— If you once got into habit of attending to your money, &amp; this implies keeping accounts, you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. feel it very little trouble. My father,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> who was the wisest man I ever knew, thought it the duty of every man, young &amp; old, to keep an account of his money; &amp; I very unwillingly obeyed him; for I was not always so bothersome an old fellow as I daresay I appear to you.—</p>
<p>We have been to Leith Hill &amp; came here yesterday &amp; have enjoyed ourselves; though mamma is not very well to day. This is a wonderfully curious &amp; pretty place.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
