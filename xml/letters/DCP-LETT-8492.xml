<p>I had hoped to have sent you a first remittance (of the money which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin so kindly advanced me) months ago.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It has been a great grief to me that it should have been so long due, and very pleased should I have been to have been able at this time to have remitted the full amount. When I wrote to you first on the above, I had in view, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Blechyndens duty, (for which I got very readily the Lieu<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Governors sanction)<ref target="#foot.f7"/> and also the Gov. Generals Gardens. It was Lord Mayo’s intention that I should look after them, but Lord Northbrook made them over to the Public Works Department, as he found out they had been many years ago.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Latterly they had been under the Private Secretary. I have been disappointed of both. I am thus sorry that I can only send you a bill for fifty pounds only. This is not half the amount which I had from M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin. I think he gave me money on three different occasions amounting in all if I mistake not to £120. I have thus to remit you a balance of £70. I shall be very pleased when I can do this.</p>
<p>You will have heard of Dr. Kings serious illness, and his leaving us for three months.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have just heard from him from Madras where he had recently arrived. He had suffered from sea sickness   This has I suspect thrown him back, though he writes very hopefully. I do hope the Nilgiris<ref target="#foot.f10"/> (where he goes) will put him all right again. But for Dr. Ewart he would have had to go home.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> He ultimately swayed the others, and they all agreed that he should try the Nilgiris for three months. I was just afraid that we might have M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Clarke back again:<ref target="#foot.f12"/> though since he lost Sir W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. Grey he does not appear to have much influence amongst the higher officials. For the three months I have to officiate, and though it is not likely to be of any pecuniary advantage to me for the present it will always be a step to a better appoint in the future.</p>
<p>I have a letter long overdue to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin as to worm-casts which I enclosed in a box to you.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> This is partly through my time having been so much occupied during Dr. Kings illness, and that I have myself been suffering from fever and ague. Just now I am ill with a fever very prevalent here—dengue—and which though not dangerous is a very tiring one.</p>
<p>I enclose the first bill of exchange in this letter and next week I shall send a second in case of any miscarriage. With very many thanks for the assistance you have given me, I remain gratefully obliged | Yours truly | John Scott</p>
