<p>It was a good job that I saw Bates, for the black-ballers had been with him; after some talk he declared that he would vote for R. Lankester, &amp; persuade as many as he could to follow same course.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Ramsay<ref target="#foot.f3"/> will do what he can, but I think this is little. Gould<ref target="#foot.f4"/> too ill to attend— Lowne writes that he will attend,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; do all that he can with others. I wrote yesterday to Jenner Weir.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Some People say council too much of a “Kew clique”—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> other says not enough Zoologists on council. I cannot but think it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be well to avoid in next council the former accusation, however false it may be.</p>
<p>F. Galton hears there will be severe struggle on the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I forgot to say that I saw Flower &amp; it required rather long talk, but he ended by saying he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. certainly come &amp; vote for Lankester.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Bates says he believes that Murie<ref target="#foot.f10"/> has been the head of the opposition.</p>
<p>I had got thus far when D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Murie called instead of answering my letter.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> He was most civil &amp; cordial &amp; expressed unbounded regret at opposing anyone supported by me; but I gather that he will oppose Lankester tooth &amp; nail. He declared most solemnly that he was not in the least opposed to L. personally &amp; that he acted solely because he did not think it was a case in which the Fees ought to be remitted.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I find that this is a <hi rend="underline">very</hi> general impression, &amp; I fear that the council has made a great mistake. Some of the opponents urge that L. afforded to enter Royal last year.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I stuck to my line of argument that whether or not Council was wrong, yet that it was cruel to black-ball L. He &amp; others have argued that they can oppose the Council in no other way. They declare that the Council does not fairly represent the Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. &amp; that old members are reelected in a circle.— I have no opinion whether there is any truth in this; but if I were on the Council, I would urge that several of the dissentients sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be put on Council. Between 30 &amp; 40 years ago there was just the same feeling in Geolog. Soc. &amp; this was cured by putting the complainers on the Council.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Please read all this latter part of my letter to Hooker; &amp; ask him whether he has read L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Derby’s speech at Edinburgh about Science, which seems to me very good.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. add that Murie declared most deliberately that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mivart knew nothing whatever about the opposition to Lankester.—<ref target="#foot.f16"/> Well it is a great misfortune, but the case must be decided by the ballot-box.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
