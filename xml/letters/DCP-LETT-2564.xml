<p>Dear Miller</p>
<p>Some months ago you were so kind as to say you would measure the thickness of the walls of the basal and side plates of the cell of Bee.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Could you find time to do so soon? Why I want it soon, is that I have lately heard from Murray that he sold at his sale far more copies than he has of the Origin of Species, and that I must immediately prepare a new Edition, which I am now correcting. By the way I hear from Murray that all the attacks heaped on my book do not seem to have at all injured the sale, which will make poor dear old Sedgwick groan.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If the basal plates and walls do differ considerably in thickness, as they certainly did in the one or two cells which I measured without particular care (as I never thought the point of any importance) will you tell me the bearing of the fact as simply as you can, for the chance of one so stupid as I am in geometry being able to understand.</p>
<p>Would the greater thickness of the basal plates and of the rims of the hexagons be a good adaptation to carry the vertical weight of the cells filled with honey and supporting clusters of living Bees?</p>
<p>Will you endeavour to screw out time and grant me this favour.</p>
<p>Believe me | Dear Miller | Yours sincerely | Ch Darwin</p>
<p>P.S | If the result of your measurement of the thickness of the walls turns out at all what I have asserted; would it not be worth while to write a little bit of a paper on the subject of your former note; and “pluck” the Bees if they deserve this degradation.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Many mathematicians seem to have thought the subject worthy of attention. When the cells are full of honey and hang vertically they have to support a great weight, can the thicker basal plates be a contrivance to give strength to the whole comb, with less consumption of wax, than if all the sides of the hexagons were thickened?</p>
<p>This crude notion formerly crossed my mind; but of course it is beyond me even to conjecture how the case would be.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>A mathematician M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wright has been writing on the geometry of Bees-cells in the U. States in consequence of my Book; but I can hardly understand his paper<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
