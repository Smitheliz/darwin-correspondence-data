<p>On my journey home, a scheme occurred to me, which I think is worth your thinking about.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Do you not think a little change would be the best thing for M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley, if she could be induced to try it?<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have been talking with my wife &amp; she joins heartily in asking whether M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley would not come here for a fortnight &amp; bring all the children &amp; nurse. But I must make it clear that this House is dreadfully dull &amp; melancholy. My wife lives upstairs with my girl &amp; she would see little of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley, except at meal times, &amp; my stomach is so habitually bad that I never spend the whole evening even with our nearest relations. If M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Huxley could be induced to come, she must look at this house, just as if it were a country inn, to which she went for a change of air. There is this one advantage, that she would have no trouble, such as she would have if she were to go to an Inn. Also we are near; so that she c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. start from the Victoria station for Beckenham, whither we could send our carriage. And Lastly you could probably come down &amp; spend the Sunday here. Now do think of this scheme. I know well that this house in its present state presents heavy disadvantages; but perhaps a little visit here might do M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley good &amp; give her strength.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>My dear Huxley | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have heard from Trübner that the Box from U. States did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> contain any M.S. Review from Wright of Boston.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It seems to have been forgotten by some accident.</p>

I first wrote that I was too ill to be out of my home, that I could not get downstairs till 1 o’clock. Her reply was, that that was the usual state of the family at Down, and I should just be following suit. What wonder that I had for her always the most grateful affection. </quote></note>
