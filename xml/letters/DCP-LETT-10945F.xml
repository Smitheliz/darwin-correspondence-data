                    <p rend="left">[…] I shall consider your dedication as a high &amp; most gratifying honour.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Your observation on the dorsal eyes of Onchidium are interesting &amp; surprising in the highest degree.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> That the same animal should be provided with eyes of two widely different types is remarkable enough; but that you should have discovered gradations in the scale of their development on the same individual is most wonderful &amp; shows us probably <hi rend="italic">by what steps they were developed</hi>. On two occasions I have found gradations on the same individual but in structures of comparatively small importance, namely in the tendrils of the vine &amp; in the ocelli on the feathers of the argus pheasant.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Even theses cases interested me much though they are quite trifling compared with your case.</p>
<p>There is much truth in what you say about photographs in comparison with published memoirs or books; but the generous sympathy which I have received from so many men in Germany &amp; Holland, some of them distinguished workers in science, has naturally given me much pleasure—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Allow me to repeat that your intended dedication will always be considered by me as a very high honour, &amp; I return you my most sincere thanks | Believe me, my dear Sir | Yours sincerely, | Charles Darwin</p>
