<p>I am much obliged for your letter and for your kindness in searching for the two vols<ref target="#foot.f1"/>   If you succeed, please to inform me, but do not send them off, as I am inquiring from some of my friends.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>If upon further reflection you are willing to take the risk under the terms proposed in your letter to bring out a new edit of the two volumes I shall be much pleased.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But then please to observe that I <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> undertake to correct the press. On two occasions M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray brought out new edits of my books without my looking at them,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> and assured me that under such circumstances the printers would guarantee a correct copy   I think it must somehow appear either by a short preface or on the title-page that the new edits are merely reprints. In case any woodblocks should be missing it is possible that I may have them &amp; would then search for them.</p>
<p>In case there should ever be a new edit of the Coral Reefs wanted which I suppose is very improbable I should like to correct a few trifling errata<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I remain | dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>
