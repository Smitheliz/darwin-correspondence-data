                    <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>

<p>If you could see my face at the present moment you would behold a vivid picture of Remorse! I am really ashamed beyond all <hi rend="underline">expression</hi> that I have allowed so long a time to elapse without acknowledging the copy of your great work which you were kind enough to send me, and without thanking you for the generous compliment which you paid me in that work.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> You over estimated the value of the trifling services which I was able to render to you and more than requited them, by the use you put them to. I value your good word more than an elaborate eulogium by most other men.</p>
<p>I devoured your book greedily and then I had’nt the decency to thank you for one of the choicest intellectual repasts that I ever enjoyed. But in this manner do I explain my apparently inexcusable negligence. When reading your book I said to myself: ‘How shall I best show M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin that I appreciate his kindness in sending me this book—and in approving of my observations? And the answer returned to that question was why by sending him matter which shall be corroborative and illustrative of his thesis. Adopting this view I at once jotted down some examples of hereditarily transmitted movements &amp;c.— and then came the hurry and worry of professional work and I read on but not pen in hand as I had hoped to do. I shall still however send you some notes and then I trust you will again receive me into favour.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Maudsley asked me to review the book but I could not at that time undertake to do so.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I propose however, with your approval, to write a paper, for the next volume of the West Riding Asylum Medical Reports—which will be published in July extending and illustrating your views on one or two points, especially with reference to the Insane.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>By this post I forward to you a few photographs of Lunatics taken here which, although not at all good may perhaps have some interest for you.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I shall be gratified if you will add them to your collection, and should you care to possess them I shall be happy to supply you with many more.</p>
<p>My health is better than it was, but I am not robust.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> My work is more arduous than ever but I shall consider it a relief and a recreation to make any additional observations that you may desire.</p>
<p>With profound respect | I am, | My dear Sir, | Yours very gratefully and faithfully | J. Crichton-Browne <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

DAR 53.1: A18 is a partial side view of a man’s head annotated ‘The Insane Ear’ in Crichton-Browne’s hand (see p. 100); with the exception of DAR 53.1: A17, all the photographs in this group are mounted on card with a stamp in red or black on the reverse that reads, ‘West Riding Asylum | Wakefield | Photographic Studio’. A24 may have been mounted with the stamp under the photograph.</note>
