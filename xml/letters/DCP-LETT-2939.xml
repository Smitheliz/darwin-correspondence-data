<p>A poser: carbonate of soda produces inflection rather than contraction in <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi>. Possible solution: glands at end of hairs absorb as well as secrete. Fascinated by currents in cells after inflection.</p>

<p>I thank you for two notes.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It was a capital thought your sending me the gum itself (so ingeniously bottled or quilled); I tried it on 3 leaves, &amp; it produced no effect; &amp; I tried thicker gum on 5 other leaves with no effect, &amp; I subsequently proved that these leaves were good ones.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If a leaf is feeble &amp; does not secrete copiously, the gum dries &amp; draws together all the hairs which it has touched; &amp; this, I imagine, must have been cause of the apparent inflection in your case. At last I have come to a puzzler, for I find Carb. of Soda causes inflection;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but I have sent to London for pure C. of soda, &amp; as that sold by Druggists is not pure. But I strongly suspect I have come across a poser. I am, however, trying my experiments in another fashion, which may throw light on subject.—   I find the glands at end of Hairs are absorbers as well as secreters. The change which takes place in the Hairs after inflection is very curious. The currents &amp; movements in the cells strike me in my ignorance as marvellous.—</p>
<p>You are very kind in your second note to say that I must not apologise for all the trouble which I have caused; but pray thank M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Croker for enquiring about the Dionæa.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Also please give my best thanks to Sir William for his wish to oblige me;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I shall be intensely curious to examine the leaves; if I cannot get a plant. If the Dionæa commonly catches only small fry, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not be surprised at a fat fly being too much for its digestion; at least I have found bits of raw meat <hi rend="underline">often</hi>, indeed I think generally, kill the leaf of the Drosera. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to hear whether Croker is pretty certain of this fact.—</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear that you are experimentising on the leaves in water. I have long thought that naturalists make far too few experiments.—</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Do you possess a copy of my “Origin of Species”; if you do not, I should much like to have the pleasure of sending you one.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
