                    <p>Your heartily sympathising interest concerning my well-being is of much greater importance to me than all my pretended misfortune. The case alluded to by Mr. Dodel is as follows:<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>In this moment the party of bigot obscurants is favoured by our emperor and tries every possible experiment in order to remove our liberal minister of schools Dr. Falk, which, indeed, under these circumstances, occupies a somewhat balancing position. Now some weeks ago this party in our “Abgeordnetenhaus” had chosen my person as a mark of attacks against the Minister.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Sheltered by their privilege as representants some members of this party covered me during three sessions with outrageous accusations, as having teached to my scholars blasphemies, atheism, nihilism, socialism etc; the only fact they could lean upon being that I had read (two years ago) to my scholars some passage out of Carus Sterne’s work “Werden und Vergehen”, in which the words are met with: “Im Anfang war der Kohlenstoff”. Without respecting the connexion of the text, these words by my bigot aggressors were taken as a derision of the words of the evangely “Im Anfang war das Wort” and hence all the above accusations were deduced. The commissioner of the government on the one side praised myself as an excellent teacher, but on the other side defended myself against the attacks of the obscurants only in a very undecided manner. At last, in the third session one of the liberal members of the “Abgeordnetenhaus” having procured to himself the work of Carus Sterne, read the text hitherto unknown and nevertheless so much discussed about, and now suddenly it became evident that the words “Im Anfang war der Kohlenstoff” in their connexion were quite harmless ones.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Thus the bigot obscurants had obtained no other effect than discredited themselves, and it was solely by the undecided behaviour of the government that some shadow of suspicion about the correctness of my teaching perhaps remained. But Carus Sterne (Dr. Ernst Krause, redacteur of the Kosmos), whose work had also been utterly calomniated, in order to be able of calomniating myself, has published two articles in one of our greater Journals in which he excellently defends his book and my person too. (I send you his articles.) I myself am just now about writing a justification of my method of teaching.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_7012.xml">Wilhelm I</ref> was emperor of Germany; <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5627.xml">Adalbert Falk</ref> was minister of culture; ‘this Party’ refers to the Ultramontanists, Catholics who wanted to integrate Church and State, with ultimate authority belonging to the former. ‘<hi rend="italic">Abgeordnetenhaus</hi>’: house of representatives (German); one of two houses of the Prussian <hi rend="italic">Landtag</hi> or legislative assembly. Müller was held up as an example of how the religious and moral attitude of schools had sunk under Falk’s leadership.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The phrases ‘Im Anfang war der Kohlenstoff’ and ‘Im Anfang war das Wort’ (In the beginning was carbon; In the beginning was the word (German)), appeared in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9418.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Sterne 1876</ref> (Genesis and decline), pp. 92–3, and may be translated in their wider context, as follows:
                <p rend="blockquote">A modern chemist, who wanted to translate the history of creation into his beloved chemical sign language, must not begin like Faust: In the beginning was the word, or the sense, or the power — ‘he can not possibly esteem power alone so highly’—and struck with a sudden light, would exclaim: In the beginning was carbon with its remarkable inner powers.</p>
                Sterne was making an allusion to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1904.xml">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s</ref> <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, which was interpreted as referring directly to the Bible and therefore as blasphemous. Müller’s critics had focused on this passage in 1877, when Müller was denounced in several conservative German newspapers as a corrupter of youth. Müller sued the newspapers, and one case reached the courts in January 1879, reawakening public interest. The affair was one strand in the nineteenth-century German Kulturkampf (the struggle surrounding the role of the Catholic Church in the emerging secular nation state). For more on the affair, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4316.xml">Kelly 1981</ref>, pp. 61–4, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10700.xml">Bölsche 1906</ref>, p. xii). Carus Sterne was a pseudonym of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2758.xml">Ernst Krause</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4"><hi rend="italic">Redacteur</hi>: editor (German).

[6], and 21 January 1879, p. [9]; no copies have been found in the Darwin Archive–CUL. Müller defended his approach to teaching in <hi rend="italic">Die Hypothese in der Schule und der naturgeschichtliche Unterricht an der Realschule zu Lippstadt. Ein Wort zur Abwehr und Rechtfertigung</hi> (Hypothesis in the classroom and natural history teaching at the Lippstadt secondary school. A word in defence and justification; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10585.xml">H. Müller 1879a</ref>).</note>
