<p>You have probably heard that Shrewsbury Schools are about to be removed to Kingsland<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I write this to you thinking that you may recollect the name of my grandfather as connected with the schools to call your attention to the following facts.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Owing to the very limited funds the Governing Body have no money at their disposal to form a cricket ground or to attend to any of the many necessities of school games. An effort is being made among the younger old Salopians to raise a fund to provide a cricket ground, boat house, fives and racquet courts and if possible a pavilion by subscriptions but what is done must depend very materially on the amount raised and a very large sum probably several thousands will be required to complete these objects. In addition to this difficulty the Governing Body are asking for large subscriptions for a Chapel from old Salopians which of course diminishes the funds available for the games. Several old Salopians at Shrewsbury have been working most energetically for this object and the boys themselves have been levelling the cricket ground under the superintendence of skilled workmen for whose wages and for other expenses the old Salopians who are masters at the school have made themselves responsible. I have been asked to collect subscriptions in London for the above objects and the Rev. G. T. Hall<ref target="#foot.f4"/> at the schools who is acting as central Treasurer of the fund will receive subscriptions or I shall forward to him any subscriptions received by me.</p>
                    <p>A circular will shortly be issued embodying what I have here stated, but I have ventured to appeal to you early in consequence of the urgency of the matter. I need hardly point out how necessary it is to provide adequately for the recreations of the schools on their removal if they are in any way to compete with other Public schools.</p>
                    <p>It was originally intended to appeal for one guinea only but representations were made that such a course would be injurious, and such limit has accordingly except as to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge been withdrawn. May I venture to ask you for 〈    〉 subscription? I shall be v〈ery〉 glad to give you any further information in my power, and will take the liberty of forwarding to you the circular which I have mentioned, when it is issued, which I expect will be in a few days. We shall be very glad of subscriptions of any amount whether large or small but of course we wish to 〈    〉 as large a sum as 〈pos〉sible.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Pray excuse my troubling you with this letter and believe me to be Dear Sir</p>
<p>Yours sincerely | J. W. Jeudwine</p>
<p rend="left">3 New Square | Lincoln’s Inn | London. W. C.</p>
<p>I may point out to you that what is now to be done must have been done whether the Schools had been removed or not. | J.W.J.</p>
