<p>I listened for the Postman’s knock with some anxiety this morning, &amp; when I received a letter &amp; saw Catherine’s hand writing, of course I was very glad, like an affectionate brother, though that was not the handwriting, I wished to see.— I hope tomorrow I shall be rewarded; for I have been a <hi rend="underline">good boy,</hi> as you told me to be when at Shrewsbury, &amp; have been working away right hard for these two last days, &amp; have cleared away some of the weeks accumulation.— I long to pay Maer a visit, so that I have a good stimulus to keep me to the collar, now that I have at last put myself to it: the tiresome printers, have not, however, sent me a sheet of the Appendix to my journal.— I have done nothing about houses, excepting taking another walk in out of the way places, for the chance of something good turning up.— I have thought over what I wrote to you about our plans, &amp; like most folks, when they come to an opinion, think it a very wise one.—</p>
<p>In Catherines letter, she tells me Susan is at Maer: I am glad of it, for I shall now have double letters from Maer.— I have asked Susan to come if possible, to London for a week in early January to buy a few pots &amp; pans &amp;c &amp;c.— do try &amp; persuade the good dear old soul to do so, for she will save us much trouble, &amp; will do it, I daresay, very well. In your last letter you say “poor old gentleman”, when you hear of my long walks, but I will have my revenge, &amp; when I see you puzzling over furniture, trying to get beautiful things for no money, I shall say poor dear old lady, you ought to have thought of this before:— I fear you will say I am most tedious, the way I go on prosing about houses: but a great dilemma has come across me to day, &amp; it is, supposing I should see a very nice house tomorrow, would it not be dreadfully extravagant to take it now two whole months, before the day of days? I think I had better not actually look <hi rend="underline">into</hi> houses, not until the latter end of the month, for would it not be intolerable to discover a good house, &amp; then not to take it for a month, but to be waiting in agony lest someone else should?— I think it will be best to go on acquiring enlarged philosophical ideas about houses, &amp; situations, &amp; then towards the end of the month astonish the House-agents by my skill &amp; sagacity.— By the way, I was amused the other day at Robert Mackintosh’s greatness of soul, when I told him I thought the house in Tavistock Square, at 150£ per annum was too dear; his contempt at such paltry economy was really quit〈e〉 edifying.— one would have supposed he had never 〈sp〉ent less than 3000 a year.—</p>
<p>One more piece of s〈c〉rattle, &amp; I have done, I have heard from Shrewsbury of a man-servant who promises very well for us, &amp; have accordingly written to tell them to make some more enquiries &amp; then secure him.— I mean to have him in London early in January, that he may learn his way about. If we succeed in getting a house early in January &amp; you succeed in getting a housekeeper, I should think it would be a good thing to enlarge her soul with a week’s residence in this instructive city.—</p>
<p>Powers of sentimentality forgive me for sending such a letter: it surely ought to have been written on foolscap paper, &amp; closed with a wafer.— I told you I should write to you, as if you really were my own dear dear wife, &amp; have not I kept my word most strictly?— My excuse must be, I have seen no one for these two days; &amp; what can a man have to say, who works all morning in describing hawks &amp; owls;<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; then rushes out, &amp; walks in a bewildered manner up one street &amp; down another, looking out for the word “To let”.— I called, however, to day, on the Lyells.— I cannot tell you how particularly pleasant &amp; cordial Lyell’s manner has been to me: I am sure he will be a steady &amp; sure friend to both of us. He told me he heard from his sister, (whom I know) in Scotland this morning, &amp; she says “So M<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Darwin is going to be married; I suppose he will be buried in the country &amp; lost to geology”.— She little knows, what a good strict wife, I am going to be married to, who will send me to my lessons, &amp; make me better, I trust, in every respect, as I am sure she will infinitely happier and happier, the longer I live to enjoy my good fortune.—</p>
<p>Lyell &amp; Madam gave me a very long &amp; <hi rend="underline">solemn</hi> lecture, on the <hi rend="underline">extreme</hi> importance, for our future comfort during our whole London lives, of choosing slowly &amp; deliberately our visiting acquaintance: every disagreeable or common place acquaintance, must separates us from our relations &amp; real friends, (that is without we give up our whole lives to visiting), for the evening we sacrifice, might have been spent with them. <hi rend="underline">or at the theatre</hi> Lyell said, we shall find the truth of his words, before we have lived a year in London.—</p>
<p>How provokingly small the paper is, my own very dear Emma | Good Night, C. D.</p>
<p>Saturday Morning. I was delighted to receive your letter: nothing in the world could be more fortunate than your being able to come to town. I had thought of asking you to do the very thing. I have not time to write by this days post, I will by tomorrow or rather that is Mondays. I want very much to know which day you will come.— You will have heard, that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hollands baby is dead.</p>
<p>Every your | C. D.</p>
