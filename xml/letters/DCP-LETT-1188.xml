<p>You could hardly have applied to a worse person than myself to speak to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Buckland,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> for I have a strong prejudice against him and I have no doubt he returns it with compound interest. But I have thought that he would at least believe my word and have accordingly just written him a long letter, telling him what you say and adding a good deal more from my personal knowledge of you and excellent opinion of your abilities. I have written very cautiously on my own part, so that I feel sure my recommendation can do you no harm, and I should be much pleased if it did you any good. I have told him that I have ventured to recommend you to call on him, and I think you had certainly better do so, whether he may or not choose to see you.— Under a coarse joking manner in my opinion he hides a <hi rend="underline">worldly vain</hi> disposition; but he is decidedly very good-natured.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I can only again say that I heartily hope that you may be successful. I assure you I have expressed strongly my opinion of your high merits.</p>
<p>Believe me | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
