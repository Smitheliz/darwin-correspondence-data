<p>I have been deeply gratified by your kindness in remembering me &amp; sending your congratulations on my son’s election as a Fellow of Trinity.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> This certainly is a very great honour to him &amp; a source of much pleasure to me. I often think of the Geological tour in N. Wales, when you allowed me to accompany you, &amp; which was so great a pleasure &amp; advantage to me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You, also, during my expedition in the Beagle sent me several encouraging messages, the actual words of some of which I still remember.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> With these recollections &amp; feelings you will believe how deeply I have been gratified by receiving your letter.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear that you suffer from so many serious complaints; but considering how often you were formerly unwell you seem to me a wonderful instance of prolonged vigour of mind &amp; body. As for myself I am always an invalid, &amp; fear that I shall never see Cambridge again, though from the many happy days spent there I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> much like to do so.</p>
<p>With the most sincere respect pray believe me | your obliged friend | Charles Darwin</p>
