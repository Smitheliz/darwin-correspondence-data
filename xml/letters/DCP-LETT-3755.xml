<p>It is a source of much pleasure to me to learn that anything I can say or do is a pleasure to you and I was therefore very glad to get your letter at that whirligig of an Association meeting the other day—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> We all missed you but I think it was as well you did not come—for though I am pretty tough, as you know, I found the pace rather killing— Nothing could exceed the hospitality &amp; kindness of the University people—and that, together with a great deal of speaking, on the top of a very bad cold which I continued to catch, just before going down—has somewhat used me up</p>
<p>Owen<ref target="#foot.f2"/> came down with the obvious intention of attacking me on all points— Each of his papers was an attack &amp; he went so far as to offer stupid &amp; unnecessary opposition to proposals of mine in my own Committee—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> However—he got himself sold at all points— Not a soul seconded him in the Committee &amp; how the mendacious audacity of the man was shewn up at the discussion—is printed in the ‘Times’—<ref target="#foot.f4"/>The Polypterous paper &amp; Aye-Aye paper fell flat—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The latter was meant to raise a discussion on your views—but it was all a stale hash and I only made some half sarcastic remarks which stopped any further attempt at discussion—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>All the people present who could judge saw that Owen was lying &amp; shuffling—: the other half saw he was getting the worst of it but regarded him I think, rather as an innocent old sheep, being worried by three particularly active young wolves—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> He rolled his eyes about &amp; smiled so sweetly every time the teeth set sharp into his weasand!<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>My wife &amp; belongings are at Felixtow— I was so alarmed about my wife that I came back rather hastily from Scotland—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I am glad to say however, that she is very much better— I think she had weakened herself by over-working &amp; the grief which September always opens afresh<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I trust you are getting better &amp; that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin &amp; the children are all well again<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I took my book to Scotland but did nothing   I shall ask leave to send you a bit or two as I get on<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>

<p>A “Society for the propagation of common honesty in all parts of the world” was established at Cambridge— I want you to belong to it, but I will say more about it by &amp; bye<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD’s letter has not been found. In 1862, the British Association for the Advancement of Science held its annual meeting in Cambridge from 1 to 8 October. CD may have written to thank Huxley for the praise he had accorded CD in his inaugural address as president of the sectional committee for ‘zoology and botany, including physiology’ (Section D), as reported in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 3 October 1862, p. 5. Speaking on the condition and prospects of biological science, Huxley had ‘passed a graceful encomium on the labours of Mr. Darwin, whose name was received with a burst of applause’, and had ‘emphatically affirmed that Mr. Darwin’s work was as perfect in its logical method as it was accurate in its scientific facts.’</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Huxley refers to the discussion of Owen’s paper, ‘On the zoological significance of the cerebral and pedial characters of man’ (R. Owen 1862c), which was read in Section D of the British Association meeting in Cambridge on 3 October 1862. The substance of the paper and the ensuing discussion were reported in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 4 October 1862, p. 7. Owen’s paper was a defence of his view, first enunciated in 1858, that certain anatomical characters of the human brain required that the species be classified in a sub-class separate from the anthropoid apes. Since its publication, Owen’s classification, and the cerebral anatomy on which it was based, had been repeatedly attacked, particularly by Huxley, who saw it as an opportunity to impugn both Owen’s scientific reputation and his honesty (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3156.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gross 1993</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6790.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Rupke 1994</ref>). In the discussion following the reading of Owen’s paper in Cambridge, Huxley had been Owen’s most vocal opponent, disputing both Owen’s ‘facts’ and his ‘reasoning’.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Owen read his paper, ‘On the characters of the Aye-aye, as a test of the Lamarckian and Darwinian hypotheses of the transmutation and origin of species’ (R. Owen 1862e), before Section D of the British Association for the Advancement of Science on 3 October 1862 (<hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 4 October 1862, p. 7). His argument was that the remarkable adaptation of parts of the Aye-aye, and their correlation, could not be explained by natural selection or the Lamarckian theory of evolution, but depended on a guiding intelligence. Owen had previously affirmed this view in a paper read before the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5302.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Zoological Society of London</ref> in January 1862 (R. Owen 1862a; see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3419.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. E. Gray, 29 January 1862</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">According to the report in <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 4 October 1862, p. 7, Owen’s paper on the human brain was criticised chiefly by Huxley, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4069.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Rolleston</ref>, and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1670.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Henry Flower</ref>, all of whom had previously attacked Owen’s views on this subject (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3156.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gross 1993</ref>). <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> reported that Rolleston had concluded by saying that: <quote type="quote"> if he had expressed himself with any unnecessary vehemence he was sorry for it, but he felt there were things less excusable than vehemence, and that the laws of ethics and love of truth were things higher and better than were the rules of etiquette or decorous reticence. </quote></note>
