<p>Many happy returns of the season to you and yours. I was very glad to hear a pretty good report of your health from your son who was here a short time since.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> We have been very busy since our summer trip, in moving from our old house, which I sold, to one more suitable for old people, being of two stories only instead of four. I built it six years since and let it till we wanted it for ourselves.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I have not heard of our old shipmates lately except Hammond—who had been very ill for a few days owing to a drain being foul but not found out in time.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I heard from King about a month since— he and his wife very well.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Poor M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Langton bears up very well under his heavy trial— his comfort seems to be taking care of the dear little children, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. L having gone to Cannes.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>My youngest brother, late Capt<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. of London. has just returned, having been dismissed his ship, because their Lordships think he did not show “<hi rend="underline">consideration</hi>” enough for a chaplain who had been insulting him for a year because he would not allow the morning service to Ritualistic or vestments with crosses to be worn, though he allowed a second service later in the day with all these kind of things the parson chose to carry on.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> As all the insults were proved at a Court of Inquiry—and written falsehoods—as well as taking liberties with black girls also against this precious parson they were obliged to dismiss him—and to please their Ritualistic friends I suppose dismissed Captain also—without any offence or misconduct of any kind ever being alleged against him. A thing unheard of before.</p>
<p>Then to make it worse they superseed the Captain immediately, but only <hi rend="underline">nominally</hi> dismiss the chaplain as he is still serving on the ship.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>My brother has applied for a Court Martial &amp; will insist on it—</p>
<p>My wife<ref target="#foot.f8"/> joins me in kind regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin.</p>
<p>Believe me | very sincerely yours | B. J. Sulivan</p>
