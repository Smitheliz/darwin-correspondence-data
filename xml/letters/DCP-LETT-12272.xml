<p>Asks CD to examine his idea that human and animal sociology are related, as each is based on the principle of mutual concession (derived from Schopenhauer’s law of compassion). If CD approves, he should write a note and forward it and GMA’s letter to <hi rend="italic">Macmillan’s Magazine</hi>.</p>

<p>Would you kindly examine the following idea by which human and animal sociology are brought under one head; and, if you think it deserving of your commendation, send this note with as many words as possible of yours, to Macmillan’s Magazine—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>How does the bee’s cell acquire its hexagonal shape? we know</p>
<p>1) That the bee’s original instinct is to build a circular cell</p>
                    <p>2) That the shape of the hexagonal cell is just such as if a number of circular cells in a liquid state had been squeezed 〈aga〉inst each other—similar in fact to the cells in the foam of soapwater blown from a pipe; that is to say to bubbles turned, by mutual squeezing from a globular into an angular shape.</p>
                    <p>Even in the case of the foam there is not exactly a bodily pressure, but merely a mutual repression of 〈ex〉pansive tendencies; and that also is impossible in the case of the bee. The only possible explanation therefore is, that an <hi rend="underline">intellectual</hi> repression takes place; that is to say each bee feeling in its own mind the reflection of the other bees’ instincts, leaves room for the exercise of those instincts; and thus the circular cell becomes hexagonal by <hi rend="underline">mutual concession</hi>.</p>
<p>If the bee were disposed to swerve to the right or left, the figure of the neighbouring bee, whose province would be infringed upon, rises in the bee’s mind; and in consequence an intellectual pain similar to that which our bee would feel if its own prov〈ince〉 were infringed upon; a reminder closely resembling that inwardly received by a man disposed to infringe upon another man’s rights. For all human rights spring, like the hexagonal shape of the bee’s cell, from mutual concessions by which individual propensities are checked.</p>
<p>Now all this illustrates the principle introduced from Indian Philosophy into modern thought by Schopenhauer, and made by him the basis of all moral and religious philosophy. The Indians call the above described feeling “<hi rend="underline">Thou art I</hi>” and Schopenhauer calls it the <hi rend="underline">law of compassion</hi>.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer spoilt what might have been a great boon by his abstruse language, his misanthropy and his fanatical atheism, and therefore not only failed to draw the necessary conclusions from his own premises but arrived at opinions diametrically opposite to them. Into these errors we need not follow him; and for our purpose it is quite sufficient to see that his “<hi rend="underline">Thou art I</hi>” principle belongs to animal as well as to human sociology.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>These two sociologies are nevertheless far from identical; as a further investigation of our principle in its application to the one and the other sociology shows; a fact at once obvious when we take the following things into account:</p>
                    <p>1) The human microcosm consists in the faculty to reproduce every individuality whether human or animal, animate or inanimate, bodily or intellectual; while we have no reason to suppose animals capable of reproducing, in their minds, any individuality not exactly exactly alike to their own.</p>
                    <p>2) The mutual reproduction of men’s individualities is principally, though not exclusively, affected by language, a faculty not possessed by animals, just because they lack its foundation, the human microcosm.</p>
                    <p>3) The human <hi rend="underline">Thou art I</hi> principle and, therefore human society, can be highly developed only by religion.</p>
<p>Repeating the above request I remain | Dear Sir | Respectfully Yrs | G. M. Asher. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
