<p>Putting you off was a great &amp; bitter disappointment,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. so have liked to have talked over many points &amp; Owen’s false letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But I had no choice, &amp; I much fear that Emma is right &amp; that I must knock off all work &amp; all of us go to Malvern for two months.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I get on with nothing.— Thank you much for your interesting note.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Keep Dana—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I have been of course, deeply interested by your Book:<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have hardly any remarks worth sending, but will scribble a little on what most interested me. But I will first get out what I hate saying, viz that I have been greatly disappointed that you have not given judgment &amp; spoken fairly out what you think about the derivation of Species.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have been contented if you had boldly said that species have not been separately created, &amp; had thrown as much doubt as you like on how far variation &amp; N. Selection suffices. I hope to Heaven I am wrong (&amp; from what you say about Whewell it seems so) but I cannot see how your Chapters can do more good than an extraordinarily able review.”<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I think the Parthenon is right that you will leave the Public in a fog.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> No doubt they may infer that as you give more space to myself, Wallace &amp; Hooker than to Lamarck, you think more of us.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> But I had always thought that your judgment would have been an epoch in the subject.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> All that is over with me; &amp; I will only think on the admirable skill with which you have selected the striking points &amp; explained them.— No praise can be too strong, in my opinion, on that inimitable chapter on language in comparison with species.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Now for a few trifling criticisms<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>p. 187. Sentence beginning “my friend M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Evans” not clear:<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>p. 229 sentence “but long after that period” seems to me awkward &amp; not clear.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>p. 231— “hence there will be passages”   It is not clear whether you refer to glaciers or floating ice-bergs, if the latter might they not have been overturned?<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>p. 257. “For Cap—Su<hi rend="doubleUnderline">ll</hi>ivan read Su<hi rend="doubleUnderline">l</hi>ivan<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>p. 264— I wonder you did not add a vivid sentence, which you could have done so well, at the end of Glen Roy, on our almost still seeing the glacier lakes.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>p. 278. the number of the p. itself at top is inverted—<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>I think the glacier chapters are almost the best in the book.<ref target="#foot.f20"/> The closing pages of Ch. XIV are magnificient, I can use no other term.<ref target="#foot.f21"/> I think this discussion has interested me almost more than the antiquity of man. The gloss of novelty was worn off the latter, yet I have been <hi rend="underline">deeply</hi>  struck by the effect of the agglomerated evidence.</p>
<p>p. 294   might not you have added preservation of striæ under lakes &amp; according to Smith of J. Hill under tidal fiords.<ref target="#foot.f22"/></p>
<p>p. 323   ought you not to have added a sentence or two on the glacial phenomena of S. America &amp; N. Zealand?<ref target="#foot.f23"/> Have you heard of Haast’s statem<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi> of pre-historic man in N. Zealand?<ref target="#foot.f24"/> I was disappointed that you did not discuss the supposed warmer period after glacial period in N. America—</p>
<p>How admirable are your remarks on Ramsay’s Theory!<ref target="#foot.f25"/></p>
<p>p. 367. I do not know whether Hooker will approve of your coupling his name with mine on mundane glacial period   He has often fought me strongly on it—<ref target="#foot.f26"/> I feel a conviction that no view throws so much light on Geograph. Distrib: Hooker even in his late papers on Fernando Po &amp; Cameroon M<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi> does not allude to the coldness of the Tropics.<ref target="#foot.f27"/> These latter cases seem to me to prove that Africa was then colder, &amp; this was the only quarter of the globe where full proof was wanting. I think I convinced Hooker that the general phenomena are not explicable on the assumption that one Tropical region remained hot as a refuge for Tropical productions.<ref target="#foot.f28"/></p>
<p>p. 370. 5 lines from bottom   Ought not “polished” to be added before “stone”? as it stands it is very puzzling.—<ref target="#foot.f29"/> </p>
<p>p. 374— W<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not S. Africa be a better case with its elephants rhinos. Lions, Hippopotamus &amp;c living in <hi rend="underline">swarms</hi> formerly with savage man<ref target="#foot.f30"/></p>
<p>p. 379. I cannot see the force of your argument. Has not the Australian remained a savage to the present day?<ref target="#foot.f31"/></p>
<p>Ch. XXI   I think it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have been advantageous to have enlarged a little more on Nat. Selec. explaining adaptations; at least this was the turning point with me.<ref target="#foot.f32"/></p>
<p>W<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> it not have been well to have given a few more striking instances of rudiments?<ref target="#foot.f33"/></p>
<p>How admirably you treat the imperfection of Geolog. record in many places.<ref target="#foot.f34"/></p>
<p>p. 417   It is of little consequence, but Hooker published his Essay a month after the Origin; see my Hist. Introduct. I asked him.<ref target="#foot.f35"/> </p>
<p>p. 421. Who is Sefström? neither Lubbock or I ever heard of him.<ref target="#foot.f36"/></p>
<p>p 446. 14 lines from bottom. A person might say that you thought that bats &amp; rodents were not placentals. you show afterwards that this would be a mistake<ref target="#foot.f37"/></p>
<p>p. 447. The fewness of individuals in Islands I believe, as explained in Origin, w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> account for the no great amount of transmutation therein.<ref target="#foot.f38"/></p>
<p>450. What a pity you give Owen’s name of “macrurus” instead of von Meyer’s proper name of Lithographicus.<ref target="#foot.f39"/></p>
<p>p. 469. Any one might argue from the middle paragraph that you were far from believing that man was descended from any animal.<ref target="#foot.f40"/></p>
<p>P. 497 Top of p. Compare mind of dog with its wild aboriginal.<ref target="#foot.f41"/></p>
<p>P. 500. I am surprized at what you say about man &amp; Miocene strata considering great gap between man &amp; other animals.—<ref target="#foot.f42"/></p>
<p>p. 505. Sentence at top of p. makes me groan.<ref target="#foot.f43"/></p>
<p>I suppose you could not lend me Owen’s paper on the Aye Aye? Is the part very expensive? I am sorely tempted to expose in Athenæum what rubbish Owen has written on the subject.<ref target="#foot.f44"/></p>
<p>I know you will forgive me for writing with perfect freedom; for you must know how deeply I respect you, as my old honoured guide &amp; master.— I heartily hope &amp; expect that your Book will have gigantic circulation &amp; may do in many ways as much good as it ought to do.—<ref target="#foot.f45"/></p>
<p>I am tired; so no more. I have written so briefly that you will have to guess my meaning. I fear my remarks are hardly worth sending— Farewell—with kindest remembrances to Lady Lyell | Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>
