<p>In the whirl of your public affairs, science may be forgotten, or if not forgotten you may have no inclination to write. But if so inclined I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very glad to have a little information on any cases of dimorphism, like that of Primula, &amp; to be allowed to quote you.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> To make sure that you may understand what I want to know: I give this beautiful diagram of the two forms of Primula.</p> 
                    <figure rend="blockCentred width45">
                        <graphic url="../images/dcp_lett_3255_1_2.jpg"/>
                    </figure>
<p>I think I have made out their good or meaning clearly. The pollen of A is fitted for stigma of B &amp; conversely. The individuals are divided into two sets or bodies, like the males &amp; females of Quadruped; but both in Primula are hermaphrodites: but I will not enter on details, as I will soon send a paper to Linn. Soc.<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I should be <hi rend="underline">eminently</hi> glad to know of other analogous cases. Are the two forms ever borne on same plant? Thyme is a different case: as the one form is simply female, stamens having aborted; these females, however, I find to be the most productive of seed.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Some of the species of Linum offer this case:</p> 
                    <figure rend="blockCentred width45">
                        <graphic url="../images/dcp_lett_3255_3_4.jpg"/>
                    </figure>
<p>I am rather too late to experiment fairly; but I am almost sure that pollen of A is <hi rend="underline">absolutely</hi> sterile on stigma of A: but good for stigma of B: whereas pollen of B is good for its own stigma B &amp; for stigma of A.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>This subject interests me much, so do help me if you can; for I have some <hi rend="underline">very faint</hi> hopes that it may throw some light on Hybridisation;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have sown seeds of Primulas raised in very scanty numbers from stigmas fertilised by what I call a homomorphous union; ie by pollen from plant of same form.—</p>
<p>If you have looked at Spiranthes let me hear:<ref target="#foot.f7"/> but if your Spiranthes are like S. speciosa figured by Bauer:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> they are very different from our S. autumnalis; which by the way at Torquay I had the good luck to see Bees fertilise: I have almost finished my long Orchis paper,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; then I must go back to my true work on Cocks &amp; Hens, fowls &amp; rabbits.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Eheu Eheu, what much better fun observing is than writing.</p>
<p>By the way I have just been amusing myself in looking at Dionæa in aid of my Drosera work. How curious it is to see a fly caught &amp; how beautiful are the adaptations compared with Drosera. But I must not run on about my hobby Horses.</p>
<p>Farewell | My dear Gray | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD referred only briefly to heterostyly in two <hi rend="italic">Linum</hi> species in the <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi> paper, stating that he intended to carry out further hybridisation experiments on the two forms (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 62–3). His paper on this topic, ‘On the existence of two forms, and on their reciprocal sexual relation, in several species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Linum</hi>’, was read to the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> in February 1863 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 93–105). In this paper, CD stated that he had put some pollen from the short-styled plants on the stigmas of long-styled plants and, although ‘it was late in the season, namely September 15th’, ultimately obtained ‘six fine capsules’, which he planted the following spring (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 94).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Sterility and hybridisation are discussed in the conclusion of the <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi> paper (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 61): <quote type="quote"> The simple fact of two individuals of the same undoubted species, when homomorphically united, being as sterile as are many distinct species when crossed, will surprise those who look at sterility as a special endowment to keep created species distinct. Hybridizers have shown that individual plants of the same species vary in their sexual powers, so far that one individual will unite more readily than another individual of the same species with a distinct species. Seeing that we thus have a groundwork of variability in sexual power, and seeing that sterility of a peculiar kind has been acquired by the species of <hi rend="italic">Primula</hi> to favour intercrossing, those who believe in the slow modification of specific forms will naturally ask themselves whether sterility may not have been slowly acquired for a distinct object, namely, to prevent two forms, whilst being fitted for distinct lines of life, becoming blended by marriage, and thus less well adapted for their new habits of life. </quote></note>
