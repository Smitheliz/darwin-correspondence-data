<p>A few days ago as I was about to write to you I found that I had mislaid your address and that I must proceed to town to obtain it,—no difficult matter for a person in good health but not a very easy affair for one circumstanced as I am, I assure you   I was much pleased when I received a copy of your latest work and though I have them all I hold it in the highest estimation as proving to me that I still live in your recollection.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have not simply perused your books but I have carefully studied them and from time to time yet I cannot arrive at any decided opinion   I find objections to your theory present themselves from time to time which I cannot overcome and I have more than once decided to write down what they were and send them privately to you. The state of my health has however overcome my resolves and here I am still working as far as is in my power</p>
<p>You are a most wonderful man producing works of such ability under such adverse circumstances   I think you must be either greatly favoured by the Devil or God almighty. I wish how I could discover how you manage   my energy is quite gone and though I have materials almost endless still I cannot work above a couple of hours in the course of a day<ref target="#foot.f2"/>   I am now suffering and writing with an effort, I have one great failing and which has always proved most disadvantageous to me the desire to apply to every kind of novelty which presents itself and in this predilection I find verified the old adage that a rolling stone never collects moss, I have one consolation that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Pusey<ref target="#foot.f3"/> appears in his proceeding very like me, you are blessed with a very opposite disposition which with your great talent and powerful imagination renders you the subject of universal admiration   I assure you I have not failed to heartily accord in all that has been said in your praise and I have always felt great pleasure in knowing that I could view you as an old friend.</p>
<p>Now that the weather we may hope will shortly admit of my leaving the house I hope you will let me know a couple of days before you inttend visiting visiting Down and I will endeavour to call at the British Museum &amp; get a shake of your hand<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Yours most faithfully | Andrew Smith</p>
<p>I am afraid the pen I have used will have so mangled what I have written that you will scarcely be able to read it</p>
