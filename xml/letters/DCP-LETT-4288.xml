                    <salute>My Dear Darwin,</salute>

<p>Your fine long letter of Aug. 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. reached me up in the country—in my native region—in the centre of the State of New York—rusticating, and enjoying ourselves mightily.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> We were among the people of a thriving region—a well-to-do set.— no <hi rend="underline">poverty</hi> near us for miles &amp; miles, i.e—no hardship, except any that a drunken laborer might bring on his family; and I longed to take you out with us in our drives that you might see a happy and comfortable country—more and more so every year,—and perhaps a larger ratio of the population refined to a reasonable degree in feeling and life than I know of in any other part of the world.</p>
<p>Well, I am at home again as well as possible, and as hearty as an ox,—thoroughly well, and all disagreeable feelings about my head quite forgotten. I hope it may keep so.</p>
<p>I hope to get other <hi rend="underline">Specularia</hi> seeds for you.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I will <hi rend="underline">consider</hi> about fantastic variation of pigeons.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I see afar trouble enough ahead quoad <hi rend="underline">design</hi> in nature but have managed to keep off the chilliness by giving the knotty questions a rather wide birth. If I rather avoid, I cannot ignore the difficulties—ahead. But if I adopt your view bodily〈,〉 can you promise me any less difficulties?</p>
<p>—If your <hi rend="underline">Lythrum</hi>-paper shall be at all equal in interest to that on <hi rend="underline">Linum</hi> it will be a gem.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>As to <hi rend="underline">tendrils</hi>, What are Hooker &amp; Oliver (the latter a Professor too) about, and where have they lived not to know anything of them?<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Every body must have seen, in <hi rend="underline">Cucurbitaceæ</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Passiflora</hi>, tendrils <hi rend="underline">reaching out straight</hi> for a certain time, and then, if they reach nothing, coiling up from the end.— Also the <hi rend="underline">sweeping of</hi> stems. But I think I never noticed that till it was pointed out in print. You ask me to tell you where anything is published on this subject. I had indicated it well enough in the little note of mine on the <hi rend="underline">visible coiling</hi>—which excited your interest. See the <hi rend="underline">first 3 sentences</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> And consult <hi rend="underline">Mohl</hi> (who is worth all Germany besides) <hi rend="underline">On the Vegetable Cell</hi>, transl. by Henfrey, and published by Van Voorst, 1852, pp. 156–158, also 151. &amp;c,—and be thankful to me for having instigated (in 1851) Van Voorst to get Henfrey to translate this little book.—tho you English pay no attention to it, when you have got it.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>No do not abandon this subject, for it will be fruitful in your hands.</p>
<p>You should go on and connect this with something <hi rend="underline">analogous</hi> in the spiral twist of the wood &amp; bark of Coniferous trees—and others— It is very marked in <hi rend="underline">Thuja occidentatis</hi>. The twist here is to the right (of the observer). But in noticing a hundred trunks or so, while up in the country, I found 4 or 5 which twisted in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Next week I will send you sheets containing abstract of Bates’ mimetic analogy, &amp; your Linum paper.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>As to Agassiz, you must not infer that I have any real ill-will toward him. I have long been an impartial and perhaps useful friend to him.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> But he is not a person to be satisfied long with any one who acts as well as thinks independently. So, a good while ago, he undertook to put me down, and has once or twice repeated the attempt. He has not yet succeeded. All the revenge I take is to worry and tease him upon occasion. But he has many excellent points and great (morphological) ability, and I am truly sorry he does not make a career at all up to his early promise.</p>
<p>Ever your cordial   A. Gray</p>
<p>P.S.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Three nos. of Boston newspaper, recently sent you, two by this mail (in which my good beau-père is again “<hi rend="underline">spiking</hi> the English”)<ref target="#foot.f12"/> please to forward to Reuben Harvey, Esq, Limerick, Ireland.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Parsons (the first) I think puts the case neater, and in much fewer words.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>You are quite out in supposing that hatred of England is increasing, or that there is the least desire to meddle with you, except in self defence<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>My own feelings were very sensitive at first, because I expected better things, and I then deferred much to British opinion. I now do neither, and nothing strikes me more than the smallness of mind and largeness of gullibility of the British people, as far as I can judge from their press, (weeklies, quarterlies, &amp; Times). But I do not suppose you will fight us because you dislike us. And so conversely. I suppose I do not see the papers which so abuse England, tho, I read influential &amp; respectable papers. But from what I do see, I think we receive far more abuse and misrepresentation, and unfair usage than we give.</p>
<p>As to the course of the war and policy of our country as to slavery, some day when you turn back to some early letter of mine you will see that I was a fairly good prophet.—that the South might have <hi rend="underline">delayed</hi> the abolition of slavery by giving up early in the conflict,—but that every month of continued resistance hastened and ensured the downfall of slavery<ref target="#foot.f16"/>   That is now <hi rend="underline">doomed</hi>, and sure near to rapid death, quick in some places—slower in others, but sure.—</p>
<p>Ill usage of <hi rend="underline">negroes</hi>—who make such good soldiers—will soon be unheard of—except with Irish. It will take some generations of American life to breed out the barbarism they bring to the country.</p>
<p>Good bye— Ever Yours | AG.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD’s interest in climbing plants had been stimulated by his reading of A. Gray 1858b (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4221.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 25 [June 1863]</ref> and nn. 2–3). The paper begins (A. Gray 1858b, p. 98): <quote type="quote"> As much as twenty years ago, Mohl suggested that the coiling of tendrils ‘resulted from an <hi rend="italic">irritability</hi> excited by contact.’ In 1850 he remarked that this view has had no particular approval to boast of, yet that nothing better has been put in its place. And in another paragraph of his admirable little treatise on the Vegetable Cell (contributed to Wagner’s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopedia of Physiology</hi>), he briefly says: ‘In my opinion, a dull irritability exists in the stems of twining plants and in tendrils.’ </quote> The references are to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5523.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Mohl 1827</ref>, pp. 63–72 and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5527.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Mohl 1853</ref>, pp. 303 and 307; see also Henfrey trans. 1852, pp. 151 and 156. There is an annotated copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5523.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Mohl 1827</ref> in the Darwin Library–CUL (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi></ref> 1: 590–4). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3354.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hugo von Mohl’s</ref> article on the vegetable cell (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5527.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Mohl 1853</ref>) was originally published in the fourth volume of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4918.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Rudolph Wagner’s</ref> <hi rend="italic">Handwörterbuch der Physiologie</hi> (R. Wagner ed. 1842–53).

Gray refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_43.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Louis Agassiz</ref>, his colleague at Harvard University, with whom he had a long-standing dispute concerning CD’s theory and other scientific and political issues (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dupree 1959</ref>, pp. 264–306 and 313–31).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">The postscript, which is written on a separate sheet of paper, has been assigned to this letter on the basis that both contain responses to the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4262.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 4 August [1863]</ref>. In addition, the postscript bears a London postmark of 14 September, which is consistent with its having been sent from the United States in the first few days of September.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12">Gray probably refers to five articles written by his father-in-law, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2995.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Greely Loring</ref>, for the <hi rend="italic">Boston Daily Advertiser</hi>, and published on 20, 22, 25, 27, and 29 August 1863.

            <note xml:id="foot.f13">The prefatory note to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4871.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Loring 1863</ref>, which presumably included the articles Gray refers to (see n. 12, above), explained that all the compiled articles ‘originated in an undertaking to reply to a letter from a highly respected correspondent in Ireland’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f14">The reference is apparently to Gray’s colleague at Harvard University, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3701.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Theophilus Parsons</ref>, who was an ardent exponent of the Union cause in the American Civil War (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1727.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DAB</hi></ref>); the newspaper article has not been identified.</note>
