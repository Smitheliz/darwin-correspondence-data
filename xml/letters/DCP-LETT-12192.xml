        <abstract>
            <p>CD regrets that he feels large parts of Krause’s essay [on Erasmus Darwin] must be omitted. Gives his criticisms and his plan for condensed publication of his own article, with only parts of EK’s. If EK is unwilling to change, CD will publish his article privately. It is manifest that EK can publish his essay in its extended form in Germany if he wishes to do so.</p>

                    <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
                    <p>I have at last read consecutively my notice (which I have greatly condensed &amp; altered in arrangement) and the translation of your article. I fear that you will be disappointed when I tell you that according to my judgment a large part of your article must be omitted.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> This has grieved me much; but it would be of no use whatever to publish a book which would not be read. It would be ridiculous to publish two biographies of the same man in the same volume: an English critic would say that your account of the life, though very well done, was merely a condensation of Miss Seward’s memoirs.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Secondly your history of the progress of evolution seems to me to be quite out of its proper place in a short life of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin; although I fully admit that it shows great research and has been to me personally very interesting. Thirdly the first part about the Botanic Garden appears to me too lengthy: an English critic would say that it was of no use to give the contents of each Canto, when any one could, if he cared, look at the book itself. Considering how long ago D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin lived, any life of him now ought to be very short. Therefore what I should wish to do would be to publish my preliminary notice condensed, with only parts of your essay presently to be indicated. But it is quite possible that you may object to my plan, and if you object I shall have no cause to complain, for I should never have thought of writing on the subject had it not been for your article in Kosmos.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If you object I shall give up publishing, but shall print my own notice for <hi rend="underline">private</hi> distribution among my friends.</p>
                    <p>I will now explain what I wish to do: after many doubts I think (as do friends whom I have consulted) that my Notice had better come first. I would then give the first 2 or 3 pages of your M.S as far as where you give your authorities   I would then omit the whole of your Life-part, as well as the historical sketch of evolution. So that after the two or three opening pages I would pass on to the general criticism on the Botanic Garden to be condensed. When you come to the transformation of species the whole of your article could be given with advantage as it now stands. The plan which I here propose has been formed after due deliberation, and with much regret on my side; but I hope that you will remember what I originally proposed was a translation of the article in Kosmos. If you assent to my plan, proof sheets shall be sent you both of my part and of your own. It is manifest that you can publish your essay in its extended form in Germany. I will explain in a preface (if you assent to my plan) about the article in Kosmos, your subsequent enlargement of it and your permission to me to condense it to dimensions fitted for the English public. Will you kindly let me hear your decision soon, because if you object to your article being cut down I must inform my publishers in London Paris &amp; America, that I have given up the intention of publishing.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am extremely sorry to have caused you so much trouble &amp; remain, my dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
