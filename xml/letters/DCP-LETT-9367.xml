<p>I am extremely sorry to hear of your late illness, as every fresh attack must shatter your health &amp; weaken your strength; but I am very glad to hear that you are now pretty well again. Of course I shall be glad to hear of a collected edition of my books, but I really can form no opinion whether it is adviseable in the way of sale.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I know, however, that some English think that collected works, printed uniformly, sell best, &amp; this has always rather surprised me.—</p>
<p>The correction of the Descent of Man has been a heavy job &amp; is not yet quite completed: it will, I am sorry to say cost you a good deal of trouble in the translation, but not so much as it has cost me, as I have had to reflect much what to alter &amp; to add.— I have also taken much pains over style &amp; this will not concern you.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> As soon as this is done I shall go on with my small book (the M.S. half-ready) on Drosera &amp; Dionæa, &amp; this will include a corrected edit. of my papers on Climbing plants.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> My next book, (if I live &amp; have strength to complete it) will be on the advantages of Crossing Plants, &amp; this will include all my papers on Dimorphic &amp; Trimorphic plants with new &amp; related matter.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> With respect to the few short miscellaneous papers which I have published, I doubt whether they are worth republishing, except perhaps two rather long papers in Transactions of Geological Soc. On the ice-action in the S. Hemisphere &amp; on the great earthquake in Chile.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I do not think I have any record of such fugitive things as mere letters to papers; but I have kept copies of most things, &amp; you can hereafter determine yourself what is worth republishing. Proofs have just begun to come in of my book on Coral Reefs.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I have given you the foregoing details, as I have thought they might be some sort of guide to you.—</p>
<p>I am much pleased to hear of the sale of my books in Germany— When you come to England, or when you leave Edinburgh, I hope that you will pay me a visit;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> but I never know long before hand, when I shall be at home, for I find that I cannot get on without frequent rests. I must have one almost immediately, as the correction of the Descent of Man has tired me much.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I hope that I have not wearied you with this long scrawl.—</p>
<p>My dear Sir | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
