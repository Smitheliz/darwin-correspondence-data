<p>Any suggestions, corrections, or notes that you may be pleased to make, will be highly prized.</p>
<p>The opinion as to the future existence of animals, which has been told by several men of high authority, from some of whose writings I have quoted, appears to me, if adopted, to afford considerable support to your grand theory, as removing a great barrier between the constitution &amp; nature of man &amp; those of animals.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>But the suggestion of course I merely offer with the greatest submission.</p>
<p>With respect to what I have wanted to throw out respecting Animals having no fear of Death, this notion I was led to adopt after much &amp; patient observation. For this purpose I have several times attended Abattoirs on the Continent, &amp; watched closely the actions of cattle of different kinds.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>When the work is completed, I shall venture to ask you to do me the honor of accepting a copy of it.</p>
<p>I have been extremely delighted with your work on Expression in Man &amp; Animals, which you were so obliging as to send me.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Every artist as well as every naturalist, should study it attentively.</p>
