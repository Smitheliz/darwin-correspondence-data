<p>From shere want of employment I write to tell you my plans about lectures<ref target="#foot.f1"/> which I have fixed much to my own satisfaction. Luckily I have none <hi rend="underline">very</hi> early, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chambers<ref target="#foot.f2"/> on Practice of Physick from nine to ten alternate days: as much time as I like in the dissecting rooms till one. From 1 to 2 demonstrations by Cæsar Hawkins<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; from 2 to 3 M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bell<ref target="#foot.f4"/> on Anatomy &amp;c. In the evening on alternate days M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brodie<ref target="#foot.f5"/> on Surgery This gives me two hours one day &amp; four the next which I think I shall be able to go through with.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to say that I have already given up my thoughts of graduating next spring, but it is by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hollands<ref target="#foot.f6"/> opinion who is just at present my oracle.</p>
<p>I find that John Bull &amp; the Age<ref target="#foot.f7"/> are published the same day &amp; hold precisely the same opinions only that y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Age is ten times the most scurrilous of the two &amp; I have therefore taken in that alone. Do you approve?</p>
<p>As soon as you get to Edinburgh if it does not prove too troublesome I’ll match the London climate against yours and see which has most drizzle. To make a fair estimate we’ll consider a London fog equivalent to a Scotch mist.</p>
<p>Liston<ref target="#foot.f8"/> has of course been very popular amongst you rustics. I was at the Hay-market on Tuesday &amp; heard several exclamations at the thinness of the house in consequence of his departure. I was reminded of you also by a s〈nu〉ffy old gentleman who in the most interesting part of the play unfortunately dropt all his snuff and was obliged to leave instantly.</p>
<p>Tell Hubbersty I delivered his parcel and also ask Price if he knows Fred. H— —’s address as I should be glad to have it and tell him to write to me if he is a Christian I have sold my insects for two thirds &amp; am to have some of Smiths Botany<ref target="#foot.f9"/> in exchange— I yesterday saw a cryptogamic work but instead of engravings the actual dried plants. They were as dear and very much inferiour to engravings in my humble opinion</p>
<p>Good Bye. | E. D.</p>
