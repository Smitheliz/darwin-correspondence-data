<p>Richard has read H Sp. &amp; thinks it sticking—but is not prepared off hand to give you an opinion as to his theory of origin of music—but he made some remarks that seem to me to fit in beautifully with your theory of expression being contrast—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> There are a certain set of notes called the common chord   When a bell is sounded these notes are also heard. I think he said they are sung with less effort &amp; I’m sure he called them the normal notes— now all calm simple &amp; dignified melodies are chiefly made out of the notes of the common chord.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> When you wish to express passion, despair—anything violent you go off the common chord &amp; this I take it he thinks makes the distinction of expression not anything so simple as going up or going down. But as you know he thinks it so easy to get into a mess, that you had better keep out of it, so I’m only writing this down for fun. Mind you the <hi rend="underline">theory</hi> is mine— the theory being, that as these common chord notes are from physical laws produced with greater care &amp; as they are familiar to us in nature—i.e. in bell &amp; I suppose any ringing sound—we express our normal states of mind by means of these notes—but when we wish to show any violent &amp; therefore less frequent state of mind, from the principle of contrast we use the others. R is going to meditate &amp; as soon as he can will send you some sort of answer &amp; H. Sp. shall go home tomorrow—but he wants to read it again</p>
<p>yours dear F HEL.</p>
