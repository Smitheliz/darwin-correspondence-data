<p>Your affectionate &amp; pleasant letter has interested, pleased &amp; grieved me.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I know that your lungs have often troubled you; but I greatly fear that this last attack has been more serious &amp; has left mischief behind. If the sea-air suits you, it seems a thousand pities that you should not make everything bend to it &amp; stay some time there. Your life is a precious one. Four days is nothing for the sea-air. When I read of you &amp; your dog I exclaimed to Emma, “how like Fox”, but I did not know of Erasmus’ saying.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I suppose you have given up all idea of Cambridge;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have begun to turn tail &amp; have resolved to go home on Oct 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>.; but if I can screw my courage up, I may go there on Saturday or Monday; but it will depend on how my stomach is. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to see the old place once again, where I have spent so many happy hours; but I am not sure whether it will not be more melancholy than pleasant; for I know I shall feel knocked up &amp; unable to ramble about &amp; see the old haunts. What pleasant hours we have spent together at our alternate breakfast &amp; teas.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> There were no fears &amp; anxious looking forward in those days. And poor dear Henslow is gone.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> About two years ago I stumbled at Down on a Panagæus crux major: how it brought back to my mind Cambridge days!</p>
<p>You did me a great service in making me an entomologist: I really hardly know anything in this life that I have more enjoyed that our beetle-hunting expeditions;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Prince Albert told Lyell,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> that he looked back with more pleasure to collecting insects, than he had ever found in stag-shooting. I am <hi rend="underline">much</hi> pleased &amp; somewhat surprised at your liking my orchid-book:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> the Botanists praise it beyond its deserts,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> but hardly anyone, not a Botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it. The subject interested me much, &amp; was written almost by accident; for it was half written as a mere paper &amp; then I found it too long, &amp; thought I would risk publishing it separately.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> What you say about it, is very pleasant; for at one time I agreed with Lyell that I was an ass to publish it.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I have lately been making some curious observations on the “dimorphic” fertilisation of other plants<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; likewise on their sensibility; &amp; upon my life I am coming to the conclusion, that they must have something closely analogous to diffused nerve-matter.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> But as you most truly say what a mystery life is; &amp; a mystery one feels the more, the more one knows.— As soon as I get home, if we all can but keep well, I must return to variation under domestication.<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>I do not wonder that you found the jelly-fishes puzzles to dissect; it would take weeks to get even a glimmering of their structure,—mere organised water.—</p>
<p>I did not know that you were doubly a grandfather.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I will send your messages to my sister.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> Perhaps Erasmus, who has never stirred out of London all this summer, will come here for our last week.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> He is very far from strong. All Darwins ought to be exterminated.</p>
<p>Farewell my dear old friend; I do most truly hope that your health may improve &amp; your lungs recover. Farewell | Yours affectionately | Charles Darwin</p>
