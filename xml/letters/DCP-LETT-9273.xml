<p>The Bishop of Falklands, who has seen so much of Fuegians, is coming to us next week, &amp; I will get all the information I can on the point you mention.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I know that two of the four lads that were a year in England, died soon after. One from lung complaint before reaching home— the other I think the following year from some internal complaint which I now forget.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but I think those settled near the station in Beagle channel &amp; leading a more settled life with fewer privations than before have remained healthy.</p>
<p>I suppose you have seen in this month’s magazine the account of Fuegia. but in case you have not I will mention that she retained only a few words of English, the names of “Baygle”, FitzRoy &amp; one or two others—but they hope she may return and pass the rest of her life at the station.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>When the Patagonian chief with son and daughter came to Keppel Island on a visit, the daughter soon died there, but that would hardly I think apply to your question.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am anxious that something should be done for that fine Eastern tribe, even the knowledge—I suppose—that white men have been kind to their neighbours appears to have changed their conduct. Near the place where Brisbane had to barricade and defend his crew against the attacks of the Natives while building the boat a large English iron ship was wrecked.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The natives treated the crew kindly and accompanied them by land to Good Success Bay where a vessel picked them up. That fine country, and grass land, south of Sebastian Bay would enable those Natives to keep cattle &amp; perhaps sheep, &amp; vastly improve their condition, and help to bring them under instruction.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>We have been been badly beat in our election, we returned a liberal member last time by 49 votes. Now the same Tory Candidate has got in by 371. through the “<hi rend="underline">Un</hi>holy Alliance” of clergy of all sections, on account of Education question, with nearly every publican, on the drink question; more than 50 public houses swimming with beer; only two remaining “liberal” with no beer. It is really come to this that “Parsons &amp; publicans”—or “Church &amp; Beer” is the cry that gives a Tory majority; or, as put forth as the principles of one Candidate (not here) “Church and State and free trade in liquor”— It is no injustice to call this the “Unholy Alliance”—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The Evangelical church party that says it wants reform to check Ritualism—with the exception of a very few of us—joined with Ritualists in returning a candidate pledged not to do anything <hi rend="underline">to</hi> check Ritualism.</p>
