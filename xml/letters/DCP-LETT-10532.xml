<p>I have quite given up marine theory &amp; accepted glacier-lakes,—not that I have seen the place since the birth of the latter theory, &amp; there seems to me some little difficulty about the degree to which the solid rocks have eroded at one point as if by a current. Nothing makes me gnash my teeth so much as the thought of that confounded paper of mine; but I have often endeavoured to utilise it by making it a lesson never in science to infer that one explanation is right because no other one seems possible.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>The present M..H is I believe certainly the same with D.M.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>In Haste, as we are just going to the Hawkshaws</p>

The ‘roads’ are three terraces that run parallel to one another along the sides of Glen Roy in Lochaber, Scotland. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2540.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Thomas Francis Jamieson</ref> believed that during a great Ice Age ice trapped a series of lakes in the glen and that the roads represented the shorelines of three of these former lakes.
