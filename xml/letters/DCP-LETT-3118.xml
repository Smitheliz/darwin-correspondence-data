<p>Many thanks for Scotch Fawn Rabbit received yesterday &amp; examined to day: I have been very glad to see it. How shall I return it? Can you find out <hi rend="underline">two</hi> points for me,—was it <hi rend="underline">wild</hi> &amp; was it (as I suppose) a single odd individual?—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>The Angora has just been examined: before making skeleton, for several reasons (great size large ears &amp;c) I suspected that it had been crossed with a large Fancy rabbit; &amp; now I think this still more strongly.— Could you get me a pure <hi rend="underline">albino</hi> rabbit? I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be very glad of another specimen.</p>
<p>Also please do not forget a half-lop, with one ear <hi rend="underline">erect</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">smaller</hi> than the other.—</p>
<p>I have got (but not yet read) the Field to day &amp; see your curious Cock, which I have quoted in my M.S.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have now done external characters &amp; shall commence on skeletons.</p>
<p>I plainly see that I shall consume much of your valuable time.— I now enclose a string of questions: some few easy to answer but mostly troublesome &amp; requiring special examination of several Fowls.—</p>
<p>You will see several apply to Shangais; also some to Polands   these will be easy to you.— My M.S. will, also, be a much longer job for you than I had anticipated.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have kept list of my Queries, which may shorten your answers.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Could you visit any one who keeps several Shangais &amp; Malays? All my queries are founded on what I have seen or heard; but it would take too much space to give my reasons for asking.—</p>
<p>Your assistance will be invaluable to me.—</p>
<p>My Dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | I have just opened your Box with Skulls. What a magnificent collection!<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I suppose that I have a score more, so that I shall have good materials. I notice that some as Bantams, are not clean enough.— I will assume that I may boil them &amp; clean them, though of course there is always some risk in this, in relation to the articulated bones at the base. But the loss would not be irremediable &amp; I will take care. I must confess that some of my own became disarticulated, but this to me was no injury.—</p>
<p>How did you saw so neatly the skull of Poland?</p>

<p>(19) Though the cock which conquers, naturally gets first choice of wives, yet from analogy with other Birds, &amp; from one account, I imagine the Hen has to be won or charmed to grant her favours.— Can you throw any light on this point, which interests me much.?— There can hardly be a doubt that the beauty of male Bird is to charm the female. Now it has occurred to me to ask you to observe, whether Hens yield to your Hen-tailed Game, as readily as to other cocks. He would be victor, &amp; so have enormous advantage, but would his want of beauty at all interfere with his amatory success, <hi rend="underline">supposing any other &amp; gorgeous cock were present</hi>.— I formerly thought of clipping and mutilating the feathers of a cock &amp; observing, but I could not spare time to observe.</p>
<p>Do you know anyone who has kept many Hen-tailed Games &amp; other Game-cocks, such a man might have observed on this point.—</p>
