<p>I wish to thank you for your kind and encouraging letter of Jan. 28, which was the more gratifying to me because quite unexpected.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>The origin of heterostylism is a subject that I should much like to study if I were so situated as to be able to carry out the necessary experiments. While studying <hi rend="underline">Oxalis violacea</hi> I had planned a series of crossing experiments on the variable <hi rend="underline">O. stricta</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I see no reason why one with the proper facilities could not by the aid of selection and skillful crossing produce long, mid, and short styled forms in time, in a manner analogous to that in which I fancy the three forms have become fixed in nature. The difference in so minute a morphological character as the size of the pollen, and in such a physiological character as the sterility of illegitimate unions would, I suppose, be beyond the power or endurance of most men.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If three such forms could be formed they ought to retain variability enough to allow of the production from them of forms like those of <hi rend="underline">O. violacea</hi> and in a manner analogous to that in which I think the latter have been produced naturally.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am moving from place to place a great deal, and it may be a long time before I settle where I can have the necessary time and facilities for such work, though if the opportunity ever comes I shall do what I can. If the forms indicated could be produced by artificial selection I think one might reasonably infer that natural selection might have worked in a similar way, though more slowly; in which case the value of crossing would be so important a factor as to explain the sterility of illegitimate unions, or any other physiological peculiarities.</p>
<p>I was very much interested in learning of the third form of Fritz Müller’s Pontederia.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Once more thanking you for your kind letter, I am | Very respectfully yours, | Wm. Trelease.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD’s letter has not been found, but see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13618.xml">letter from William Trelease, 14 January 1882</ref> and n. 1.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">In his study of <hi rend="italic">Oxalis violacea</hi> (violet wood-sorrel), Trelease found only two stylar forms, both of which were characterised by two sets of stamens of different lengths; he concluded that the dimorphism was derived from an earlier trimorphic state (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11524.xml">Trelease 1882</ref>, p. 18). <hi rend="italic">Oxalis stricta </hi> (yellow wood-sorrel) has both heterostylous and homostylous forms. Both species are native to North America.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD referred to crosses made using pollen of the same form of flower in dimorphic or trimorphic plant species as illegitimate, and those fertilised by pollen of a different form as legitimate (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7749.xml">‘Three forms of <hi rend="italic">Lythrum salicaria</hi>’</ref>, p. 186).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Trelease had compared the case of <hi rend="italic">Oxalis violacea</hi> with that of a species of <hi rend="italic">Pontederia</hi> (pickerel-weed) described by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3070.xml">Fritz Müller</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5678.xml">F. Müller 1871</ref>). Müller had at first found only two forms but had recently discovered a third; he described it in a now missing letter to CD of 2 December 1881 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13599.xml">letter to Fritz Müller, 4 January 1882</ref> and n. 4; see also<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10372.xml"> F.
