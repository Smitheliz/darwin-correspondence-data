<p>I was very glad the other day to receive your letter. Whoever told you I was wrath at you—a married man—not having written before was the grandfather of all liars.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I much suspect it must have been that arch sinner old Herbert, whose imagination, as well know, was ever powerful at invention.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>You could not have written to a worse man than myself for news; for I live out of nearly all society &amp; see none of our old friends, although I shall ever treasure up recollections of them.— I scarcely ever see even the best of good fellows, old Herbert, as I have my hands so full of work, that I am obliged to economise even minutes. Of course you have heard of J. Cameron marriage, &amp; at his conversion into the best of country parsons!<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I should much like to hear some tidings of Frederic Watkins;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> there never was a man, who made his conceit so loveable. In the midst of this great smoky city I very often catch myself thinking of my country walks at Cambridge with you, and with Watkins and Venables by moonlight.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am the more full of Cambridge ideas, just at this present day, as on Thursday I am going to pay Henslow a visit for a short time.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have been plagued with headachs of late &amp; am going to give myself a holiday.—</p>
<p>You ask me about my doings and my plans, which, by the way, you did not set me a very good example in performing by not telling me more what you yourself are about.— I should have liked to have known what branch of the fine arts or of literature is the hobby horse.— I know your feelings about science; they are something like those of my brothers, who, when I was telling him some wonderful <hi rend="underline">facts</hi> (as poor Lowe<ref target="#foot.f7"/> would have said) in geology, exclaimed, “Oh be quiet, I don’t care a damn for the whole Kingdom of Nature”.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Now for myself,—I am turned a complete scribbler,—I have written a volume of travels, which has been printed some months since but its publication is delayed owing to Capt. FitzRoy not being ready.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I am editor to a government work of the Zoology of the voyage, which will run on for about three years.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I have got half through a book on geology which will be followed by another, &amp; perhaps by a third!.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>So you will say God help the Public, and in truth in these writing days they need the prayers of all good men.— I often laugh to think that I of all men, should turn a writer of books.— Lastly I am Secretary to the Geologi〈cal〉 Society, which however is not much more 〈than〉 a sinecure.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> Of the future I know nothing I never look further ahead than two or three Chapters—for my life is now measured by volume, chapters &amp; sheets &amp; has little to do with the sun— As for a wife, that most interesting specimen in the whole series of vertebrate animals, Providence only know whether I shall ever capture one or be able to feed her if caught. All such considerations are hidden far in futurity, but at the end of a distant view, I sometimes see a cottage &amp; some white object like a petticoat, which always drives granite &amp; trap out of my head in the most unphilosophical manner.—</p>
<p>Many thanks for your very kind invitation to pay you a visit after the Newcastle meeting; but I shall not go there:<ref target="#foot.f13"/> when one gets only a months holidays in the year, one cant give it up to flatter &amp; be flattered, which seems the grand object of the British Association. You see I sneer at science to flatter you, therefore am I a worthy brother in the cause.—</p>
<p>I saw a short time since one of the Miss Hollands, who told me some news about you.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Good bye | My dear Whitley. | Your sincere friend | Chas. Darwin</p>
