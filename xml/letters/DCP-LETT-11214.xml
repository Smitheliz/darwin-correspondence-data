<p>A few weeks ago I wrote to you from Whitehaven &amp; related a story about elephants getting drunk.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Yesterday I happened to fall in with the book in wh: I read the story originally— I have copied out the passage, &amp; enclose it— The title of the book is</p>
<p>“<hi rend="underline">The Large Game</hi>, and Natural History of South &amp; South East Africa from the Journals of the Hon: W. H. Drummond.</p>
<p>Edinbro’ Edmonston &amp; Douglas 1875—”<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>In the Preface the writer says his experiences extended over 5 years ending in 1872 “during which time to all intents &amp; purposes I lived amongst the natives &amp; the game”<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>“About Natural History as a Science I know little or nothing— I have been careful to exclude everything but what has come within my personal knowledge—”<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>If this be true, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Drummond has himself seen the elephants in a state of intoxication, but the wording of the passage itself is a little hazy—</p>
<p>I suppose the fruit of the “umganu tree” contains alcohol when ripe or when decaying?<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I must apologize for troubling you with this story but it may be interesting to you, if it is to be relied on; &amp; if not to be relied on, it is well that the mistake or inaccuracy should be made clear—</p>
<p>Yours faithfully | W M Moorsom <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

<p>“Even in Zululand there is but one spot where they (elephants) still exist. They frequent the country from the Pongolo northward, during the summer season, retiring to their fastnesses in the interior at the approach of winter— The general time of their arrival is simultaneous with the ripening of the fruit of the umganu tree, of which they are passionately fond &amp; doubtless come in search of— This fruit is capable of being made into a strong intoxicating drink &amp; the elephants after eating it become quite tipsy, staggering about, playing huge antics, screaming so as to be heard miles off &amp; not seldom having tremendous fights.—</p>
<p>Native hunters fear to approach them when in this state, but on the principle that it is safer to quarrel with a drunken man than a sober one, I consider that so long as you possess sufficient nerve not to become flustered by their trumpeting or by the exhibitions of strength displayed upon the trees &amp; upon one another, you have far more chance at such a time of killing several as they are not so likely to take to flight at the first shot &amp; perhaps make their next halt 30 miles off.”</p>

He attributed their state to the consumption of the fruit of the Southern African umganu or marula tree (<hi rend="italic">Sclerocarya birrea</hi>). The fruit can be used to produce an alcoholic liqueur, but it is thought unlikely that the fermented fruit could make elephants drunk (Morris <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> 2006).</note>
