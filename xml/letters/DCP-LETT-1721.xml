        <abstract>
            <p>Discusses how best to simulate the light at a particular point on the earth’s surface using coloured glass; considers sunlight as composed of three "principles", varying in proportion according to latitude, which affect germination, lignification, and floriation.</p>

                    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
<p>many apologies are due from me, to you, for my apparent neglect— The fact, is, that shortly after seeing you I had to leave Town—and institute some enquiries connected with the production of Coal and Iron—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> This completely engaged my attention—and you were forgotten.— Pardon this I pray you.—</p>
<p>As I understood you, your object is, by the use of absorbent media to produce conditions—as it relates to the Solar radiations, similar to those which prevail in the countries, to which the plants under experiment are indigenous.<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> <ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>It is found that the three principles—or phenomena—of the Sunbeam Light, Heat and Actinism, vary according to some fixed law—not yet well defined—as we proceed from the poles towards the Equator<ref target="#foot.f3"/> To confine our attention to the Northern Hemisphere— The sunshine of Norway may be represented by  5A+5L+5H That of Italy to 3A+6L+6H—and as we advance nearer the Line the conditions will be well represented by 1A+7L+7H. I believe I have pretty clearly proved, that, the Chemical principle <hi rend="underline">Actinism</hi>—is active in accelerating Germination and those operations in the growing plant which are strictly Chemical—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Light</hi> acts by stimulating the vital forces of the plant—and thus accelerates the formation of wood.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I distinguish this <hi rend="underline">Living</hi> Chemistry—effecting the decomposition of Carbonic Acid—broadly from that process—which may take place in dead matter—producing Gum &amp;c <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Heat</hi> evidently operates by its ordinary Calorific force—producing effects due merely to exaltation of temperature—and combined, as it were, with some Chemical force—in Herschel’s <hi rend="underline">Parathermic rays</hi> <ref target="#foot.f6"/>—Heat produces the full developement of the Flower—carrying on indeed all the processes of reproduction. In the Geographical distribution of Plants, I think I perceive relations between the plant and the Sunshine which are explainable upon this view.</p>
<p>Now—we best imitate the conditions of a Norwegian Sky by a pale Blue Glass— Those of Southern Europe by a light Yellow one and those of Tropical Asia by a red glass. I enclose a few small pieces which may guide you in your Selection. After all, you will find it important, to try a few preliminary experiments—and determine from those the colours of the Media—under which your experiments shall be made. <anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>In any way it will afford me much pleasure to aid you— It is not probable that I shall ever be able to resume my investigations on these matters—and it would rejoice me much to find so able an observer as yourself—fairly working over this fertile field of research—</p>
