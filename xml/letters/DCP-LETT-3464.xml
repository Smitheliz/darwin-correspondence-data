                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I cannot tell you how much pleasure your long letter gave me—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I shall have much real enjoyment in trying the experiment upon Hollyhocks.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I shall also try the Larkspurs if possible, I have seeds of several kinds— I had also promised myself that I would try Beaton’s long and short stamened experiment on Pelargoniums—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I always like to prove these kinds of things for myself.</p>
<p>Mr. Black from the Herbarium at Kew was stopping at Shanklin for his health last week, so taking advantage of a leisure day I ran down to see him.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Walking along the cliff near the landslip we saw what we took to be a cluster of wild carrots. I took up a few roots, would you like to have one or two? The celery and beet, too, grow wild here— would they be of any service to co〈mpare〉 with the cultivated vars.</p>
<p>〈    〉 〈flo〉wer find the two forms of Linum<ref target="#foot.f6"/> 〈    〉 but then we never raised it from seed, 〈    〉 〈possi〉bly all I observed might have originated 〈from〉 〈c〉uttings from one individual. I must try if I can get seed of it.</p>
<p>We have still a few bits of marshy ground left undrained near here—some in-land towards the downs and some near the shore with brackish water. Pray let me know what plants growing in such places are likely to be dimorphous.</p>
<p>I do not know for certain whether Mormodes &amp;c eject their pollen-masses to a distance;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> it is better to keep silence than to state anything upon which there is a doubt in one’s mind. To be candid I must admit that I have less practical acquaintance with Orchids than, perhaps, with any family of plants.</p>
<p>Do not fear that I shall take less interest in any experiment you suggest than in any thing I might myself originate. It has 〈alw〉ays been my opinion that persons situated 〈as I〉 am should be satisfied with observing 〈and rec〉ording little facts—leaving the Master-minds to show what is their practical use and bearing; and at the same time to suggest what sort of facts are most worthy of being sought for, and where most likely to be found. There is yet so much to be learned in the way of experiment that I have often thought it would be only right for the Government, or better still one of the great scientific societies, to furnish the means for carrying them out in a systematic manner. A little bit of ground, a director, and one or two earnest enquirers after truth, would be all that would be required. There is too much to be done at Kew, the men are too busy to be able to follow out an experiment with the necessary patience and constant attention. At least that was my case while there.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear that you are unwell— as for myself I am by degrees regaining strength and hope as the sprin〈g〉 advances I shall be myself again. C〈lose〉 confinement in the hot-houses at Ke〈w tried〉 me severely; had I taken more out-of-doors exercise perhaps I should not have felt it so much, but I was too anxious about my plants and even on a Sunday I was afraid to lose sight of them. In the hands of a careless man so much damage may be done in so short a time.</p>
