                    <placeName>New Haven—</placeName>
                    <date>Ap. 27. 1857.</date>
                    <salute>My dear Sir:—</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
<p>I had intended to have replied to your last letter by the last mail,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> and commenced my sheet. But a heavy cold in my head compelled me to lay it aside for the time. Your former letter also remains unanswered.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I assure you I take pleasure in contributing in any way I can to your labors, and wish I could do more than is now possible. The world needs a much more thorough search before the principles that flow from the Geog. Distribution of Species will be satisfactorily known.—</p>
<p>On the point on which you enquire, I can only say we need facts.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> We know almost nothing of the species of the Antarctic. Fuegia is the most Southern point—&amp; this is in latitude 50 to 56<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> as you know. The South Shetlands have furnished a gigantic Idotæa (called by Dr Eights Glyptonotus Antarcticus)<ref target="#foot.f4"/> —and the Arctic has analogous large species, possibly—I cannot say certainly,—the same subgenus. This exhausts our Antarctic Catalogue, excepting a few Oceanic Amphipods, and the Serolis an Antarctic type.</p>
<p>With regard to the Fuegian species, There are the genera <hi rend="underline">Serolis</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Halicarcinus</hi> (Brachyman) peculiar Southern types, unrepresented, as far as now known, at the north. Halicarcinus has a representative genus, (Hymenicus) at New Zealand (Bay of Ids. lat 35<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> <hi rend="superscript">o</hi>) and another (Hymenosoma) at Cape of Good Hope; so that the subfamily (<hi rend="underline">Hymenicinæ</hi>, as I call it) is cold temperate rather than Polar.</p>
<p>Another Characteristic Fuegian genus is <hi rend="underline">Lithodes</hi>— But this has species in the cold waters of the North Pacific &amp; North Atlantic, and one species extends as far South as Puget’s Sound on the Columbia river. <hi rend="underline">Eurypodius</hi> occurs from Cape Horn to Valparaiso,—being a cold temperate genus; and although unknown to the North, there is the closely related genus <hi rend="underline">Oregonia</hi>, found in Puget’s Sound.—</p>
<p>In the Northern Seas, the genera Hippolyte &amp; Crangon abound in species, while we know thus far of but one Hippolyte from the colder Southern latitudes (Hip., ignobilis of Dr Kinahan, Jour. Roy. Dublin Soc. Oct. 1856),<ref target="#foot.f5"/> and no Crangon. More investigation will probably bring some to light; yet these will still stand, we may presume, as northern genera. Hippolyte however has tropical as well as cold water species. The Crustacea genera of the cold temperate waters have fewer species and are more numerous, especially among the Maioids, or triangular Crabs, and the Amphipods, than those of the tropics. The cold-water species of Crustacea are more apt to be spinous Species.— I do not know of any species of the cold temperate South, identical with those of the cold temperate north.</p>
<p>You have no doubt observed what I have written, on p. 1579 of my Report, on the Crustacea of the colder zones.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It is my impression that the species of the regions South of Valparaiso (cold temperate) differ more in genera from those north of San Francisco, that those of the warm temperate South from those of the warm temp. north.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> But without more observations, it would be difficult to prove this by tables for comparison. The Galapagos afforded Dr Bell a great variety of Maioids,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> and they would counterbalance any diversity among the maioids of more extratropical regions. The Maioids, you remember are prominently a cold water group, and the cold southern waters that sweep over or around the Galapagos account for the abundance there of these Crustacea.</p>
<p>The paper of Dr Kinahan, to which I alluded, is not quite satisfactory in some respects. In making a comparison between Dublin Bay &amp; Port Philip Australia, he is not careful to mention only representative genera or species. He says (p. 133) that <hi rend="underline">Ozius</hi> <hi rend="underline">serratifrons</hi> of Port Philip is replaced by <hi rend="underline">Carcinus mænas</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Pilumnus hirtellus</hi> of Dublin Bay. So, <hi rend="underline">Cyclograpsus 8-dentatus</hi> is spoken of as representing a <hi rend="underline">Portunus</hi> in Dublin Bay. It is true that in all cases, the species of a region are those that replace the species of another region: and a Catalogue of the two, exhibits the contrast. But these genera are not representatives in any proper sense. His other comparative statements on the same page are of this kind.</p>
<p>I have just learned that Prof. Agassiz &amp; a naturalist of Boston have a collector now in the Pacific, who is to collect every thing at the Islands, commencing with the Sandwich Isds.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I wish some person could spend a few months between valparaiso and the Antarctic in as diligent search, with dredges &amp;c. It would bring much to light. The U.S. North Pacific expedition that returned home last year had an excellent Naturalist on board by the name of Wm. Stimpson, who is now at the Smithsonian Institution Washington City, studying and describing his specimens collected between the East Indies and Behrings Straits &amp; along the American Coast down to San Francisco. He is an <hi rend="underline">Invertebrate</hi> man in his pursuits and you will gather some idea of his Collections from the fact that he has 900 species of Crustacea Here is a very large addition to the Cold-water Fauna. He is now upon the Crustacea, but has not yet any results to bring out, as his genera species are not named.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>The Purbeck discovery is a grand one.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> If you take hold of geology by its deeper fundamental principles of progress, you find all such facts only illustrations of those principles. But if we look only to the more superficial conclusions such as those relating to the range of special groups,—which in fact Can hardly be called principles,—we find our notions often upset. I have just received a copy of Lyell’s Supplement, and believe I have to thank you for it.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>If my letter does not satisfy you, and you think I can aid you farther, I shall expect other enquiries. I always value your letters, and shall ever remain | with warm esteem | Sincerely yours | James D. Dana <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> C. Darwin, Esq.—</p>
