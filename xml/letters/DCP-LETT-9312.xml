<p>I was present on Thursday evening last at The Westerham Amateurs &amp; Gardeners Society (of which I am a member)<ref target="#foot.f1"/>   I was much delighted to hear the Librarian announce the presentation by yourself of that wonderfull work “Origin of Species” also “The Voyage of the Beagle”<ref target="#foot.f2"/> ’tis a great honour to our Society and very kind of you. The “Origin” was once lent to me, and I experienced such an amount of wonder and pleasure that ever since I have wanted to tender you a tribute of thanks and gratitude for your incessant labours and wondrous observation—and which you have so fearlessly and courageously given to the world</p>
<p>I have spent many hours (chiefly at night and early morning, being occupied with a small business during the day)<ref target="#foot.f3"/> endeavouring to grasp the idea of Selection in its varied forms, I found the study difficult, it requires such close and thoughtfull reading—but that which I could comprehend made difficulties a delight, and work a pleasure, through your kindness to us I shall now have an opportunity that has not offered before. A Gentleman in the neighbourhood has presented me with “Fertilisation of Orchids”<ref target="#foot.f4"/> a family of Plants that I have for some time paid a little attention to— I am reading it with great pleasure, it is full of wonders and interest.</p>
<p>I send you by this post a flower of Cyclamen Persicum, a dimorphism that sometimes occurs in Persicum— I grow C. Persicum &amp; C. Coum   I have noticed it several times in Persicum but never in Coum. Would the severe Hybridisation that Persicum has been put to render any explanation?</p>
<p>I thought the Flower might amuse you.</p>
<p>The circumstance of presenting us with the Books—I thought offered an opportunity to thank you and to offer you very humbly my love and gratitude that I feel for your stupendous work, your most keen and laborious observation, and acute thought.</p>
<p>I am a stranger to you (except in spirit) and I have felt very diffident in addressing you, please to pardon me for trespassing on your time, and forgive my presumption</p>
<p>With much respect and gratitude I am Sir | Your humble Servant | Wm Withers. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
<p rend="left">To Chas Darwin Esq<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>.</p>
<p>P.S. I believe the Secretary will forward you the thanks of the Society which was most cordially voted— my few lines are distinct from that.</p>
