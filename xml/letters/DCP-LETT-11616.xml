                    <p>You have done me the greatest service which one man can do another, viz saved me from perhaps making a fool of myself; for I thought of sending a note or short paper on Thalia to Linn. Soc.— But now after reading Delpino’s admirable account of Maranta (I will hereafter look to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Nicholsons, for I have ceased to keep copies of Gardeners’ Chronicle) I am afraid to publish until examining more flowers &amp; all mine are withered; so I must wait till next year, for Thalia-flowers could not be sent by post.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Reading Delpino &amp; examining the beautiful supply of flowers of Maranta &amp; Calathea received this morning quite fresh (pray thank M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lynch)<ref target="#foot.f3"/> shows me that I must be very cautious, though I still believe that sensitiveness has here been added to Thalia. I have wasted a good deal of time, but have seldom enjoyed anything more than making out the action of every detail of structure. I shall not want any more flowers of Thalia or maranta, for as I said in the case of Thalia it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be necessary to have the plant on the spot.</p>
                    <p>There are many other interesting things in your letters; how very odd about the water in variegated leaves.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>I have carefully tried seedlings of Quercus pannonica with glass filament in front of vertical glass &amp; can see no signs of any conspicuous movement in the leaves.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be the most unreasonable man in the whole universe, if I had dreamed of your getting me a young Pinus in a pot: I have sent my gardener to one large nursery-garden near here, but he did not succeed, but I shall try elsewhere.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>Good Heavens what a bother it must be looking over many examination papers, if they are at all like the ones sent!<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>I rejoice to hear at last a good account of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Dyer.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
                    <p>I do not doubt that you underrate greatly your Geograph-Distrib: Lecture.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I think one always does so at first, &amp; then afterwards one can see the merits of one’s own work.</p>
<p>With very many thanks | Farewell | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. Since the above was written I have worked again at the maranta flowers &amp; the liberation of the pistil is certainly, as Delpino says, purely mechanical. To my surprise 4 more Thalia flowers have opened, &amp; I still think that here we have irritability; but I do not see yet how I can decide.—</p> 
                    <p>My Arachis hypogea plant is dying &amp; I have extreme wish to observe flower-peduncle (this, I know is not right name) burying the pod.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> If you can aid me in this pray do. I so much wish to observe &amp; compare all sorts of movements. But alas I want rest, &amp; on Aug 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> my wife is going to take me for 17 days holidays: oh Lord how I wish that they were over.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
                    <p>I have not succeeded in getting any stems which are <hi rend="underline">negatively</hi> heliotropic; but I am now observing the tendrils of <hi rend="underline">Bignonia capreolata</hi> from Kew, &amp; these are finely negatively heliotropic. I think that you told me once that some roots are positively or negatively heliotropic: can you aid me with such.?<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Heaven forgive me for being so troublesome.</p>
<p>When I began I had no intention to write so unconsciably long a letter</p>
