<p>I have been very bad for fortnight &amp; could not read your M.S. before today &amp; yesterday.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is, in my opinion excellent—style perfect—description first-rate (I quite enjoyed rambling in forests) &amp; good dashes of original reflexions. I must write very briefly.— Remember that large sale of a Book depends much on chance,—on whether public mind occupied—other books coming out &amp;c &amp;c., but I feel assured that your Book will be a permanently good one, &amp; that your friends will always feel a satisfaction at its publication.— I will write when you like to Murray.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Could you add a notion by simile to kind of mysterious sounds heard in forest? but be vague &amp; very brief in any simile.—for description as it now stands is grand.— Did the native look round &amp; shrink or hide when he trembled &amp; heard sound?—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> This is capital.—</p>
<p>Matador very good—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Better than very good.— at p. 9. ought you not to enlarge one sentence to show why the diversity of classes of Lianas interested you? Is it because as to showing that many Families have thus become modified—something in same way as Marsupials, Edentata, Carnivora, Rodentata, &amp; Quadrumana have here in another manner become “<hi rend="underline">climbers</hi>”.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>How are moths &amp; sphinxes in Tropics.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Did you sugar? Is the little Heron insectivorous?<ref target="#foot.f8"/> State somewhere for me, whether any of the Mammals &amp; Birds <hi rend="underline">often</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">long</hi> kept in confinement in native home, breed?<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I like much discussion on Burmeister.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I like all.— <hi rend="underline">I am very weak</hi> &amp; tired.— Do not think you have anything to thank me for— it has been pleasure.— Go on as you have begun &amp; you will surely succeed.—</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Hooker is much interested by what I told him about your conclusion of colours. of Butterflies &amp; Tropics.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD was reading the manuscript of the second chapter of Bates’s book <hi rend="italic">The naturalist on the River Amazons</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>; see letters from H. W. Bates, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3377.xml" resp="#automat">6 January 1862</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3381.xml" resp="#automat">11 January 1862</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD had offered to write to his publisher, John Murray, on Bates’s behalf (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3266.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to H. W. Bates, 25 September [1861]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">In the published version of the passage to which CD refers (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 72–3), Bates compared a sound he sometimes heard in the Brazilian forest with ‘the clang of an iron bar against a hard, hollow tree’. He described the mythical beliefs invoked by the native inhabitants of the forest to account for such sounds, and recounted the reaction to them of a native youth in his service: ‘He would crouch down behind me, and beg of me to turn back’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">In his second chapter, Bates described the Sipó Matador, or ‘Murderer Liana’, a parasitic vine that destroys its host tree as it grows, thus bringing about its own demise (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 53–5).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">In the published account (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 49), Bates included the sentence: ‘The number and variety of climbing trees in the Amazon forests are interesting, taken in connection with the fact of the very general tendency of the animals, also, to become climbers.’ CD repeated the analogy in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1457.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Climbing plants</hi></ref>, stating (p. 205): ‘America, which so abounds with arboreal animals, as Mr. Bates remarks, likewise abounds … with climbing plants’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Bates described the moths found at Pará in his third chapter (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 104–5).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 82.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">In a later chapter (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 191–4), Bates described the absence among Brazilian aborigines of a ‘notion of domesticating animals for use’, and discussed the possible influence on human culture of the ‘presence or absence of domesticable animals in a country’. He noted that while there was ‘no lack in the Amazonian forests of tameable animals’, the animals were ‘useless from not breeding in confinement’. In a section of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> entitled ‘Sterility from changed conditions of life’, CD discussed the failure of many animals to breed in captivity, even in their native country. Citing the above, he stated: ‘Mr. Bates … strongly insists on similar cases’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 2: 150, 153, 156; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 99, 2: 113).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Bates had asked CD to comment on his treatment of remarks made by Karl Hermann Konrad Burmeister on the nature of tropical forests (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3377.xml" resp="#automat">letter from H. W. Bates, 6 January 1862</ref> and n. 10).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">In his book Bates challenged the widely held view that the brilliant colouring of many birds and insects in the tropics was due to the climate (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, 1: 21). See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3377.xml" resp="#automat">letter from H. W. Bates, 6 January 1862</ref> and nn. 5 and 6. No correspondence between CD and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref> on this point has been found.</note>
