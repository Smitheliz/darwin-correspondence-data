<p>I arrived last Monday, having left my wife at Hitcham—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> all were well &amp; cheerful there—when I left— Old Henslow was very much cut up, though being wondrous stolid he did not show it much &amp; he, in common with all the family, occupied themselves throughout industriously. Poor Mrs. H went off as peacefully as possible,—without a struggle, having had no pain for the last 12 hours.— She was a very gentle lady, who I had become very deeply attached to of late years. She inherited the calm self-possession of the Jenyns to the full;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> had long known that any severe attack would certainly carry her off, &amp; had led that kind of life which regarded death as going out of one room into another—happy soul!</p>
<p>Henslow was most sincerely pleased with the letters of his friends on the occasion, &amp; I need not say with your’s as much as any— all spoke lovingly of her, as you did. too, &amp; the old gentleman was always repeating <hi rend="underline">that</hi>.<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/></p>
<p>I took down the most difficult genus of Indian plants I could think of to work at.—viz <hi rend="underline">Impatiens</hi> of which there are just 100 Indian species! I have made the first rough draft of a monograph of them.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; was interested at the result as bearing on one of your problems, The genus is an extremely local one, there being both very few extra-Indian species, &amp; the Indian species being extremely local! &amp; you will be glad to know that they do not run into marked varieties at all, nor the species badly into one another. though somewhat.</p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>I have still some of your questions to send you answers to &amp; others I cannot answer I am sorry to find.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Have you read Livingstone? he says that the proximity of wild bitter cucumbers to cultivated ditto, makes the fruit of the latter bitter too!<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
