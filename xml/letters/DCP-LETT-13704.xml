<p>Has sent last week’s <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> wth J. S. Newberry’s paper ["Hypothetical high tides", <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> 25 (1882): 357–8]. CD thinks Newberry is right. This week’s issue has a letter against Newberry by Charles Callaway ["Letters to the editor: hypothetical high tides", <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> 25 (1882): 385].</p>  
<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury has launched a series by scientists in the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Review</hi> on what is known and what is theoretical in science. [The series appears to have begun with an article by Robert S. Ball, "The boundaries of astronomy", 41 (1882): 923–41]. CD was asked to participate, but refused.</p>

<p>I sent last week’s Nature to you thinking that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to see D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Newberrys paper, &amp; I cannot but think that he is right.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> In todays Nature there is a letter by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Callaway &amp; a 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> letter (who has done good work on Pre Cambrian formations) against Newberry; but it seems to me that he quite underrates the effect of gigantic tides rushing over low land. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Callaway like other geologists seems to read very carelessly, as he brings forward as his own new view the greater force of the old wind-currents.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It is wonderful what interest your work has excited. The Archbishop of Canterbury &amp; a lot of other such men have persuaded a number of scientific, more or less religious, men to write a series of articles in the Contemporary R<hi rend="superscript">w</hi>. on what is absolutely known &amp; what is theoretical in Science (they applied to me &amp; I refused) &amp; I see it announced that Ball will write on the evolution of the earth, Plants &amp;c.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>We have had a very nice visit from Ida &amp; Horace of 8 days &amp; William &amp; Sara were here for 2 days, but I was unfortunately bad during those days.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Ida was very sweet &amp; is a first-rate mother.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Horace is full of ideas about new things to make &amp; today Stokes wrote for his address to arrange a meeting with him at the Standard Office. Horace is going to various places in London to see calculating machines &amp; to ascertain what kind of results are most wanted.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>You will see the newspapers even in Jamaica, so it is no use telling you anything about public events; but Parliament seems to me going to the dogs as quickly as it can, &amp; I almost wish that Gladstone would resign.— I would not, however on any account say this to the Litchfields.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I hope very much before long to receive a letter from you, telling us that you are moderately well.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3509.xml">John Strong Newberry</ref>’s article ‘Hypothetical high tides’ was published in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, 16 February 1882, pp. 357–8. In it, Newberry considered what effect tidal forces would have had if they were once so great as George’s theory of the moon’s origin predicted. Newberry concluded that the geological record showed no evidence of such extreme tides. For George’s recent work on the the viscous state of the earth and tides, see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11410.xml">G. H. Darwin 1880</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11304.xml">G. H. Darwin 1881a</ref>. George had recently written an article in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> qualifying his earlier estimates of ancient tides (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13604.xml">letter from J. W. Judd, 8 January 1882</ref> and n. 1). In a letter from Emma Darwin to G. H. Darwin, 20 February 1882 (DAR 210.3: 40), Emma added a message from CD, ‘Newbury the author of the first article in Nature is trustworthy man, &amp; what he says about the nature of the most ancient sediments quite agrees with my impression’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Two letters countering Newberry’s conclusions were published in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, 23 February 1882, p. 385. The first, from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_793.xml">Charles Callaway</ref>, distinguished different types of tides and their varying effects, while the second, from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_9505.xml">Abraham Hale</ref>, pointed out that in more confined waters, such as the Mediterranean, tides were hardly perceptible.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4651.xml">Archibald Campbell Tait</ref> was the archbishop of Canterbury. In November 1881, a conference had been held at the archbishop’s residence, Lambeth Palace, and a committee was set up to promote the expression of religious views among men of science. One of the aims was to present a series of articles ‘to consider how far the theories in each science without any reference to Christianity rest on fully proved &amp; verified laws &amp; how far on hypotheses’ (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 29, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12789.xml">letter from W. R. Browne, [20–2] November [1881]</ref>). The announcement regarding <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_262.xml">Robert Stawell Ball</ref>’s forthcoming article has not been identified, but his article ‘Boundaries of astronomy’, about the ‘line which divides the truths which have been established in astronomy from those parts … hypothetical’, appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Review</hi>, June 1882  (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11723.xml">Ball 1882</ref>, p. 923).

Further articles appeared later (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11725.xml">Condor 1882</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11726.xml">Romanes 1882b</ref>). </note>
