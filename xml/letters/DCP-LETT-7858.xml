<p>Very many thanks. As soon as I read your letter I determined not to print the paper, notwithstanding my eldest daughter, who is a very good critic, thought it so interesting as to be worth reprinting.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Then my wife came in, &amp; said “I do not much care much about these things &amp; shall therefore be a good judge whether it is very dull”. So I will leave my decision open for a day or two. Your letter has been, &amp; will be, of use to me in other ways: thus I had quite forgotten that you had taken up case of Giraffe in your first memoir, &amp; I must look to this.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I feel very doubtful how far I shall succeed in answering Mivart,— it is so difficult to answer objections to doubtful points &amp; make the discussion readable— I shall make only a selection. The worst of it is, that I cannot possibly hunt through all my references for isolated points,— it would take me 3 weeks of intolerably hard work.— I wish I had your power of arguing clearly. At present I feel sick of everything, &amp; if I could occupy my time &amp; forget my daily discomforts or rather miseries, I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. never publish another word.— But I shall cheer up I daresay soon, having only just got over a bad attack. Farewell God knows why I bother you about myself.—</p>
<p>I can say nothing more about missing links than what I have said. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. rely much on pre-Silurian times; but then comes Sir W. Thompson like an odious spectre.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Farewell.— yours most sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>I was grieved to see in Daily News that the madman about the flat earth, has been threatening your life.— What an odious trouble this must have been to you.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>P.S. There is a most cutting Review of me in the Quarterly: I have only read a few pages. The skill &amp; style make me think of Mivart.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I shall soon be viewed as the most despicable of men.</p>
<p>This Q. Review tempts me to republish Ch. Wright, even if not read by anyone, just to show that some one will say a word against Mivart, &amp; that his (ie Mivarts remarks) ought not to be swallowed without some reflection.—</p>
<p>P.S I have now finished the Review: there can be no doubt it is by Mivart &amp; wonderfully clever.—</p>
<p>I quite agree with what you say that Mivart fully intends to be honourable; but he seems to me to have the mind of a most able lawyer retained to plead against us &amp; especially against me.— God knows whether my strength &amp; spirit will last out to write a chapter versus Mivart &amp; others;<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I do so hate controversy &amp; feel I shall do it so badly.—</p>
