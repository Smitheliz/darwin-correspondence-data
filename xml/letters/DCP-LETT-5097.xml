<p>I thank you sincerely for your two letters of Mar. 6 &amp; Ap. 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Your account of the Orchis with affinities toward Cephalanthera, Vanilla, &amp; Glossodia is extremely curious.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I am much surprized at the course of the vessels; but D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Crüger partly convinced me (as well as some observations which I have made on some other plants) that vessels often fail to give true homologies: at present I feel quite in the dark on the subject.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> As I am not likely to take up Orchids again, I did not like to retain your really beautiful drawings as they might be of use to yourself.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I am very much obliged for all the facts which you give me in your former letter on the changes in the flora &amp; fauna in your ditches &amp; especially on the sea coast.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> If ever I have strength to publish my larger work these facts will come in very useful.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The only analogous facts which I have met with refer to frequent changes in the Fuci growing on the same part on our shores.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>That is a singular fact of which you tell me about the male Orchestia externally like a female.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I have rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> your little pamphlet about poor old Gray’s absurd blunders.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Such men do much harm in Nat. History; but he has done wonderfully well in accumulating materials for the Brit. Museum.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> You must have read carefully my book on the Lepadidæ to have picked out Gray’s method of classifying Scalpellum<ref target="#foot.f11"/>   As you attend to plants, will you be so kind as to observe whether Oxalis with you exhibits different forms; for D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hildebrand of Bonn writes to me that the C of Good Hope species are trimorphic like Lythrum, as indeed I was aware as I have been experimenting on some for the last two years.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I suspect that aquatic &amp; marsh-plants are apt to be dimorphic so if you see any with a pistil much longer or shorter than the stamens pray look at the flowers of 3 or 4 other plants.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I have almost finished correcting the new Ed. of the Origin<ref target="#foot.f14"/> &amp; I am pleased to hear that my labour will be so much the more advantageous as a 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> German Ed. is immediately to be printed revised by Prof. Leonhard.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> As you feel interested on the subject, I may mention that I have lately read two pamphlets in our favour, by good men, one by Oscar Schmidt &amp; the other by Carl Nägeli.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I think Rutimeyer, for whom I feel much respect is also with us; by the way he quoted in one of his last works your account of the metamorphoses of the “Garneelen”.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>With sincere thanks for all your kindness pray believe me | yours very truly | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I will keep safely your note on the curious Orchis &amp; can return it to you if you sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> desire it<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Müller’s account of the orchid was contained in his letter of 3 April 1866 (see n. 1, above; see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5173.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Fritz Müller, 2 August 1866</ref>). He also discussed the orchid in letters to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4240.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Max Johann Sigismund Schultze</ref>, 2 June 1866, and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3069.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hermann Müller</ref>, 1 July 1866; the letters are reproduced in Möller ed. 1915–21, 2: 83–4, 86–9. Müller described the orchid as similar to <hi rend="italic">Cephalanthera</hi> in form and foliage but with flowers closely resembling <hi rend="italic">Vanilla.</hi> He thought the flower was noteworthy in that the two stamens of the outer whorl were not merged with the labellum as CD had described (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, p. 294), but were clearly present in rudimentary form, though infertile (see Möller ed. 1915–21, 2: 84, 87). Müller did not mention <hi rend="italic">Glossodia</hi> in the letters to Schultze and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3069.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hermann Müller</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1100.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hermann Crüger</ref> had argued that the ‘production and multiplication of vascular cords and their distribution’ was related to ‘physiologic activity’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1676.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Crüger 1864</ref>, p. 132), and cast doubt on CD’s claim in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, p. 290, that tracing the spiral vessels of orchids could help determine the homologies of the parts relative to other flowers. CD added a reference to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1676.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Crüger 1864</ref> to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6011.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 235, while maintaining his former claim.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">The ‘larger work’ was presumably the ‘second work’ referred to in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 4, in which CD planned to ‘discuss the variability of organic beings in a state of nature’. This work was never written.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7"><hi rend="italic">Fucus</hi> is a genus of brown algae, formerly in the kingdom Plantae but now in the kingdom Chromista. In the nineteenth century the term was also used more generally to refer to seaweed and kelp; species are known to occur in all three intertidal zones. CD had written about the geographical range of <hi rend="italic">F. giganteus</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Macrocystis pyrifera</hi>, giant kelp) in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4250.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Journal of researches</hi></ref>, p. 304. In his ‘big book’ on species (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi></ref>, p. 284), CD quoted <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2161.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Henry Harvey</ref> on environmentally induced changes in <hi rend="italic">F. vesiculosus</hi> (bladder-wrack).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">The information on the external similarity of the male and female forms of this amphipod must have been contained either in the missing portion of Müller’s <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5027A.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter of 6 March 1866</ref> or in his missing letter of 3 April 1866 (see n. 1, above). Müller had earlier discussed dimorphism in males within the genus (see F. Müller 1864c, pp. 16–17).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Müller’s paper (F. Müller 1864b) was a critique of the generic diagnosis of a type of sea-pen (Pennatulacea) in the family Renilla (now Renillidae), given by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1959.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Edward Gray</ref>. Gray had proposed that the species <hi rend="italic">Renilla edwardsii</hi> should be put into a new genus, which he called <hi rend="italic">Herklotsia</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3081.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. E. Gray 1860</ref>). Müller argued that Gray’s diagnosis was severely flawed, partly because of the disparity between live and preserved specimens of the organism, but also because of Gray’s use of inaccurate terminology (see F. Müller 1864b, p. 353). <hi rend="italic">Herklotsia</hi> is now considered to be an invalid genus, and is placed in synonymy with <hi rend="italic">Renilla</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8391.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Williams 1995</ref>, p. 101). Müller’s paper is not in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Gray was keeper of the zoological collections at the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8646.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">British Museum</ref>. He had facilitated CD’s classificatory work on barnacles by arranging access to the museum’s specimens, providing CD with his own collection, and advising him on procuring other collections (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Appendix II).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">Müller had prefaced his paper with a quotation from <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4837.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1851)</ref>, p. 216, in which CD claimed that the ‘inordinate multiplication of genera’ destroyed ‘the main advantages of classification’. The statement was made in the context of a critique of Gray’s adoption of generic names for four species that CD included in a single genus, <hi rend="italic">Scalpellum.</hi></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2283.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Friedrich Hildebrand</ref> had written a paper on trimorphism in <hi rend="italic">Oxalis</hi> that he had promised to send to CD when it was published (Hildebrand 1866c).
