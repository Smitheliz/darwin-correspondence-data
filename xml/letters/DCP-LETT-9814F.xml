<p>I am afraid from your pamphlet that there is much reckless cruelty; but I do not at all know how far the operations to which you refer in the London Hospitals are performed on animals rendered insensible.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> That any experiment should be tried without the use of anaesthetics, when they can be used, is atrocious.</p>
<p>I would gladly sign the Report (1870) of the British Assoc. but I could not sign the paper which you sent me before;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> as, judging from other sciences, I believe that Physiology will ultimately lead to incalculable benefits, and it can progress only by experiments on living animals. Any stringent law would stop all progress in this country which I should deeply regret.</p>
<p>I admit in the fullest way that acquiescense in one form of cruelty is no reason for not earnestly trying to stop another form; but I cannot but be struck by the injustice with which physiologists are spoken of, considering that those who shoot birds for mere pleasure, cause by wounding them manifold more suffering than do the physiologists (besides the indirect suffering of traps);<ref target="#foot.f4"/> yet the sportsmen are not blamed, while physiologists are spoken of as “demons let loose from hell”.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I earnestly wish that some good may arise from the present movement, and believe me | Very sincerely yours | Ch. Darwin.</p>
