<p>In reply to yours, received this morning, I beg to say that on referring to my vast collection of notes I find the following entry.</p>
<p>“Ascensio an Island of the Caroline group in 11 North Lat in the S. Seas, lately discovered by H.M. Sloop Raven. A gentleman who went to reside on this spot, found a place called Tainen covered with extensive ruins of an Antique town; but settled so low that it is only accessible in boats; the water coming to the steps of the houses. the stones are laid artificially, but without cement; some being 20 feet long.”— “the walls have doors &amp; windows. the present inhabitants are different in habits &amp; manners from the other natives 〈    〉 South Sea Islands: the social system is 〈    〉 <hi rend="italic">[</hi>more<hi rend="italic">]</hi> advanced; 〈    〉 on a par with the men &amp; their customs approximate 〈    〉 Europeans 〈    〉. Lotzky who communicated 〈    〉 to society March 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1839 had 〈    〉 letter from 〈    〉 stating that the 〈    〉 had since visited 〈    〉 &amp; a survey.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> he stat〈ed〉 〈    〉 since 〈    〉 monuments 〈    〉 I have not noted whence I extracted the above but 〈    〉 may have been from the 〈    〉 intelligence very similar to the above has likewise reached me from New Holland, where I 〈    〉 &amp; other correspondents. As a mere fabrication I could not accept it, although 〈    〉 what I have expressed on the nature of 〈    〉 of the materials brought forward in the consideration of the population of America, you will perceive that I had left the absolute authenticity open as regards perhaps several of 〈    〉</p>
<p>I shall now be exceedingly glad to receive from you a few lines in order to have your opinion whether the above Tainen &amp; your Pouynipète or Seneavine are the same. If I understand it rightly, they must be distinct for Ascension cannot well be the same; it has been long <hi rend="italic">[</hi>known<hi rend="italic">]</hi>. I may remark that the <hi rend="italic">[</hi>Capped<hi rend="italic">]</hi> parallelitha<ref target="#foot.f2"/> of Tinian seem to belong to the same people; and it is a question whether the pillar Idols of Easter Island &amp; the stone sculptures of Pitcairns may not likewise be referred to them.</p>
<p>Now let me add a few words respecting yourself: It gave me very sincere pleasure to hear from you, as in some measure it was an evidence of your health 〈    〉 in that condition at least which I call “working order” for that is my <hi rend="italic">[</hi>opinion<hi rend="italic">]</hi> of my own, when I can get to my table to write or draw as if I were strong. Sometimes I have wished you were resident in this place. the usual mildness of the climate being favourable 〈    〉 upper part of the town is in a sufficient 〈    〉 I own it would be a sacrifice for you 〈    〉 kindred <hi rend="italic">[</hi>minds<hi rend="italic">]</hi>. 〈    〉 three persons of extensive information to be 〈    〉 there is no public library richly stored. I find that the classes of books that I want in my several pursuits are all, or with rare exceptions missing 〈    〉 I have to purchase them myself unless the private library of a very kind hearted friend help me on.</p>
<p>My eldest daughter<ref target="#foot.f3"/> who had the pleasure of seeing you in town about a twelve month ago, desires to be kindly remembered.</p>
<p>I am | My dear Sir | Most sincerely yours | Charles Ham<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Smith Charles Darwin Esq | &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c</p>
<p>P.S. would you have the goodness to favour me with the title of the little work wherein you have spoken of the coral formations of the Caroline Islands?</p>
