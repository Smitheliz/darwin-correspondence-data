<p>Please read enclosed &amp; if you think Lindley would like (that being my object) it, post it; but if not, or too trifling, I <hi rend="doubleUnderline">beg</hi> you to tear it up.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Many thanks for naming the Festuca; I daresay some of my grasses are wrongly named; &amp; though I doubt whether I shall ever profit from my work, it has been a <hi rend="underline">very great</hi> amusement, &amp; since writing I have found 3 noble new kinds.—</p>
<p>What a wonderful fact you tell me about S. Australia: how utterly inexplicable.— Henslow used in old Cambridge days urge the importance of preoccupation: what can this mean, in annuals or biennials but an abundance of seed? I have a great mind to sow some untouched land with seeds of the kinds <hi rend="underline">already</hi> growing there &amp; see whether this by itself will increase their numbers.— Your splendid Thistle fact will of course, I hope, appear in detail in Indian Flora.— What a sentence that was in your note, about my Festuca agreeing <hi rend="underline">as ill</hi> with F. pratensis, as plants generally do with their descriptions. How this shows the variation of species!—</p>
<p>I have begun to sow seeds to break their constitutions (<hi rend="doubleUnderline">if I can</hi>) &amp; have been reading Hunts Book on light,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; he is going to write to me with suggestions &amp; tell me where I can get coloured glass. Therefore it is really impant to me if you will let me hear soon what Daubeny has to say against him;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> after reading Lawson’s letter<ref target="#foot.f4"/> the evidence seems first rate on blue glass accelerating germination. How do you like green glass of Hot-house?—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>One more request (do not hate me) will you read (&amp; carefully return) the list sent me by H. C. Watson<ref target="#foot.f6"/> (who has been <hi rend="underline">most</hi> kind, &amp; whom I am going to visit!) &amp; tell me whether you think Lawson or any seedsman would be at all likely to be able to supply me with any of of those <hi rend="underline">not</hi> scored with red. (Those scored with red Henslow through his children is going to get me &amp; no others grow wild about here.). Have you not at Kew a British Garden: could you spare me any which I could not buy; ie if you think the experiment deserving of so much public (now you are a public servant) encouragement: when I have tried these, I shall do no more salting.—</p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to talk over the list of seeds<ref target="#foot.f7"/> (by the way you did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> send me the seeds themselves, except of Saxifraga, &amp; you wrongly accused Kew, when you said in an old note that my bad germinating seeds were due to Kew)<ref target="#foot.f8"/> which you sent me to try in salt-water. Most truly did my wife say the other day “what a pleasure it would be to you, if you did but live within reach of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker.”</p>
<p>I have lately been at work, compiling from all works on Hybridism; &amp; most interesting work (though I know you despise it) I have found it; the difficulty has wonderfully enhanced my respect for Carpenter et id genus omne.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I have just broken ground myself in attempting to hybridise;<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I want seed of the wild Dianthus caryophyllus; can you aid me in this?</p>
<p>Ever yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Let us have one line to say whether a little girl or boy is added to the world.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
