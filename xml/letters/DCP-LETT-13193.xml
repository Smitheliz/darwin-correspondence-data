                    <p>I have worked this morning at Ch. VI. &amp; have taken almost all your very good corrections &amp; omissions.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have not ventured to alter that clumsy sentence about “half of two-thirds &amp;c”, because this was written by George, &amp; he might swear that I had spoiled the mathematical accuracy of the statement. Tomorrow I shall do the short Ch. VII. in which the corrections seem heavy.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Thank Heaven all the heavy work is done. I am extremely glad that you approve on the whole of the little book, for I have felt awfully doubtful.—</p>
<p>I can have no doubt that you ought to publish about the false circumnutation due to light, not only as a caution about the necessary rate of a klinostat (&amp; this is very important) but as showing in how short a time light acts most efficiently on the mould.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> By Jove will it not be very difficult writing in German? I rather regret its appearing in German, but now do be a good boy &amp; send a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">full</hi> abstract to Nature.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>How <hi rend="doubleUnderline">very</hi> nicely Elfing takes the affair &amp; how friendly he feels towards you.— I suppose that he is too poor to pay you a visit at Down.— His discovery about a Galvanic stream causing movement is very remarkable.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Suggest to him to excite the extreme tip of the radicle <hi rend="underline">alone</hi>; &amp; this could be done if the rest of the radicle was kept in very moist air, &amp; then he could observe whether the upper part of radicle became curved. Why on earth does he use <hi rend="underline">zinc</hi> plates, instead of platina? Would it not be worth while to tell him that I <hi rend="doubleUnderline">suspected</hi> that zinc-plates in peat &amp; moss killed Drosera. If the tips are really sensitive to Galvanism,—it is a new &amp; fine case.— I will not mention it to a soul.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I am rather sorry to hear about Tieghem, for the book seems to me a very good one—(though he evidently despises me!)<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Our house here is an excellent one &amp; most comfortable in every way, with plenty of rooms &amp; large ones.— I have just been trespassing at near end of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Marshalls park &amp; found it perfectly charming.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I do so wish you were here.—</p>
<p>Henrietta, Bessy &amp; Leonard have just started in Steamer up Lake to meet Litchfield, who will be here at 4 P.M.— Bernard very jolly, but has become fearfully sensitive; he walked with us into M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Marshalls Park, carrying all the way the Soldiers received this morning, which made his little eyes sparkle like diamonds.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>When I began this note, I intended to write only single page &amp; this will account for all the scraps.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I have just had an awful invitation from Paget to lunch with him on Augt 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> to meet the Prince of Wales.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
                    <p>Good Bye—dear old Backy wish that you were here. | Your affectionate Father, | C. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1224.xml">George Howard Darwin</ref> often assisted CD with mathematical aspects of his work. In <hi rend="italic">Earthworms</hi>, p. 266, a sentence reads, ‘Now if the two-thirds which is below the hole be divided into two equal parts, the upper half of this two-thirds exactly counterbalances the one-third which is above the hole, so that as far as regards the one-third above and the upper half of the two-thirds below, there is no flow of earth down the hill-side.’ Chapter 7 was the conclusion; it was nine pages long in the published version.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">See <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13192F.xml">letter from Francis Darwin, [before 4 June 1881]</ref> and n. 8. Francis was preparing a paper on his experiments on circumnutation of the mould <hi rend="italic">Phycomyces nitens</hi>; he had observed what he described as a clearly circular movement of the sporangium in response to the rotation of the klinostat. The movement was very regular, unlike typical circumnutation, and stopped when the speed of rotation of the klinostat was reduced (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11409.xml">F. Darwin 1881b</ref>, pp. 477–8). </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Francis’s paper appeared in <hi rend="italic">Botanische Zeitung</hi>, 29 July 1881; no English abstract was published in <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Francis had enclosed a letter from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1485.xml">Fredrik Elfving</ref> to him with his letter to CD of <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13192F.xml">[before 4 June 1881]</ref>; Elfving’s letter has not been found, but he evidently discussed the fact that <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_9180.xml">Julius Wortmann</ref> decided to publish his observations on circumnutation in a sporangium earlier than he originally planned so as to publish before Elfving (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13166F.xml">letter from Francis Darwin, 19 [May 1881]</ref> and nn. 3 and 4). Elfving published his observation of an autochemotropic (avoidance) response in <hi rend="italic">Phycomyces nitens</hi> in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11407.xml">Elfving 1881</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Elfving was studying the tropic effects of galvanic currents on roots. In his paper, ‘Ueber eine Wirkung des galvanischen Stromes auf wachsende Wurzeln’ (On an effect of galvanic current on growing roots; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11427.xml">Elfving 1882</ref>, p. 259), Elfving noted that for electrodes he used zinc or platina (an alloy of platinum) or occasionally carbon. He further noted that the eventual death of the root happened regardless of the nature of the electrode, and therefore concluded it was not due to the toxic effect of zinc. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4097.xml"><hi rend="italic">Insectivorous plants</hi></ref>, p. 273, CD had noted that most metal salts were highly poisonous and caused rapid and strong inflection in tentacles of <hi rend="italic">Drosera</hi> (sundew), but that zinc chloride did not cause inflection and was not poisonous; however, CD did not discuss root absorption of substances.</note> 
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">In his letter of <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13192F.xml">[before 4 June 1881]</ref>, Francis had mentioned that both <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1268.xml">Anton de Bary</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4513.xml">Ernst Stahl</ref> had a low opinion of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4755.xml">Philippe van Tieghem</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Traité de botanique</hi> (Treatise on botany; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11346.xml">Tieghem 1884</ref>).</note>
