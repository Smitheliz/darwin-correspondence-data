<p>I am in due receipt of your’s of the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. in<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> and am glad to find your stay delayed a little longer than you anticipated in Montevideo— You would receive f<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Rosa all your goods &amp; chattels &amp; also the announcement of our reconstruction here so that now we are all quiet</p>
<p>I could not send you either the shot or powder both being prohibited by the law here and under present circumstances it was impossible to obtain per- mission— The Chart some of your Officers saw at Bahia Blanca was the original or a Copy of the one given by Cap<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Fitz Roy to the Government &amp; borrowed by me for the use of the Captain of the Dolores— it is not published and I believe the Government do not intend publishing it: On your receiving your goods you will I think say that I fore told your wishes as they are packed as you require them I hope you will not lose any part of them I gave them in particular charge of the Captain and Owner who was also on board—</p>
<p>As the schooner “Dolores” had sailed for Bahia Blanca previous to your leaving it was impossible for me to obtain any further Information about the fish caught off Cape Corrientes than what Stewart the Owner has this day said to me viz that he had a number of fish on board some taken at New Bay, some in Belgrano bay and off Cape Corrientes on some Bank or other &amp; he was not aware of other particulars &amp; indeed had he been I do not expect he would have told me as he proposes sending the Schooner to fish there— Your information respecting the River Chupat<ref target="#foot.f1"/> will be very interesting &amp; should there be Neu- trias please get me the correct Latitude and Longitude &amp; any other “por memores”—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> As you have been pleased to express yourself in so kind a manner for my poor services towards you during your staying here allow me to assure you that independently of your private worth which I consider intrinsic I do not consider I have done more than what any Englishman should do for the promotion of any scientific end which may tend to the aggrandisement of his Country &amp; I shall be truly happy at any future period I can by any means in my power serve you or promote your views in a scientific way— pray write me when you arrive in Chili &amp; also in England at some future period I may perhaps procure for you some specimen that may be interesting— M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. L and family are well &amp; unite with me in good Wishes. Should you go to Mercedes; you have my Letter to Keen which will answer every purpose— You would have been amused to see the ragged Reg<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi> 7000 strong they say that alarmed the town a day or two— | I am D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sir | Yours truly | Edward Lumb</p>
<p>We have an American 18 gun Ship from Valparaiso homeward bound here; she arrived yesterday—</p>
