                    <p>You must not apologize for giving trouble, for I can only assure you that it is both a pride &amp; a pleasure to assist your work—and if I descanted a little on what had to be done to the view of Elston, it was only to prepare you for a very different looking drawing, which you might imagine almost a different <hi rend="underline">place</hi>, only that I shall do it by rule.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have two pretty views of Elston as it is now, and they are some assistance as they show the real proportions, wh’ are not trustworthy in the old drawing—</p>
                    <p>Sir Brook Boothby lived at Ashbourne Hall, &amp; he &amp; his wife were “Cat &amp; Dog”, &amp; only kept together by their one little daughter—6 years old, and a perfect beauty. It died of brain-fever—and, after the funeral, Sir B and Lady Boothby drove off in different directions, and never met again. The sonnets he composed on the child’s death are most hopeless and melancholy—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The epitaph on the monument says “<hi rend="underline">The unfortunate Parents ventured their all on this frail bark, and the wreck was total</hi>”</p>
                    <p>He had a beautiful recumbent figure done by Banks<ref target="#foot.f4"/> the sculptor wh’. is in Ashbourne Church, and of wh’. this gives some little idea, I have often sketched it.</p>

                    <p rend="left">It is represented with bandages round the head. I believe there were faults on both sides, as regards the conjugal differences. Sir B B was <hi rend="underline">elegantly literary</hi> and a dilettante and he was so extravagant as to spend three fortunes and to die poor after all.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Believe me | yours very affect<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>— | V. H. Darwin</p>
<p>May I ask you to observe that my address is altered. A man came yesterday and put new numbers on all the doors in the street. I am glad to have done with Park Villas, for, I assure you there was neither Park nor Villa to be seen!.</p>
