<p>Thanks HTS for <hi rend="italic">Entomologist’s Weekly Intelligencer</hi> [no. 2, 12 Apr 1856]. Agrees with his remarks [in "Why did Mr Westwood get the Royal Medal?"], but explains that a change in rules for awarding the Royal Medal has been made. Earlier it had to be given for publications in <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</hi>, which explains small number of entomologist recipients.</p>

                <div type="transcription">
                    <p>I am much obliged to you for so courteously sending me a copy of “Entomologist Weekly Intelligencer”.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I do not suppose that I ought to mention anything which passed on the Council. But I may say that I individually have nothing to object to in your remarks.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I can see, however, that apparently you are not aware of a most important change made 3 years ago, with consent of the Queen, in the distribution of the Royal Medals; before that time it was compulsory in the Council to give it to men for publications in the Transactions, &amp; this will explain, if you take the trouble to look at the names, the cause of many of the awards.— It was, I think, an <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi> bad rule. Hence I think you will perceive why, <hi rend="doubleUnderline">except to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Newport,</hi> no medal was given to an Entomologist.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Since the rule was changed, the 3 recipients have been myself, (when I was not on council) D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hooker, &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Westwood.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> As I have been a recipient, of course I can say nothing whether or no the awards have been well, or atrociously ill made; but this I can say that the Council take great trouble in deciding, &amp; a most difficult &amp; disagreeable task it is to perform.—</p>
<p>Pray believe me | Dear Sir | Yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Stainton was the founder and editor of the <hi rend="italic">Entomologist’s Weekly Intelligencer</hi>. He had previously corresponded with CD about another entomological publication of his, the <hi rend="italic">Entomologists’ Annual</hi> (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 5, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1767.xml" resp="#automat">letter to H. T. Stainton, 20 October [1855]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The second number of the <hi rend="italic">Entomologist’s Weekly Intelligencer</hi> (12 April 1856) opened with an unsigned editorial, clearly written by Stainton, entitled ‘Why did Mr. Westwood get the Royal Medal?’. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5077.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Obadiah Westwood</ref> had been awarded the medal in 1855 (see n. 5, below). Stainton thought the award was long overdue and complained that Westwood’s most famous contribution to science had been published many years previously (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8305.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Westwood 1839–40</ref>). He concluded that the recent recognition of Westwood’s merits was because entomology was now ‘more prominent than formerly’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7402.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">[Stainton] 1856</ref>, p. 9–10).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3516.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George Newport</ref> was awarded the Royal Medal in 1851, not for his entomological work but for his physiological investigations in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5845.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Newport 1851</ref>, which had been published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</hi>. None of Westwood’s papers had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">It had been CD who had nominated Westwood for the Royal Medal in 1855 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 5, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1659.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to T. H. Huxley, 31 March [1855]</ref>). In his nomination text, CD had cited Westwood’s ‘Introduction’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8305.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Westwood 1839–40</ref>) and his ‘various Monographs and Papers on Entomology’ (Royal Society council minutes). However, since <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8305.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Westwood 1839–40</ref> had been published more than ten years previously, under the new rules it had to be excluded from the citation.</note>
