                    <p>I have left instructions for the plants to be returned to Kew &amp; I hope not much the worse for their residence here.— I have kept one of the 2 plants of Bignonia capreolata, as I believe these are not very precious.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The date will be put outside this note when the plants are despatched. I have failed with the aerial roots: I have no doubt that they are apheliotropic, but they move so slowly that sources of error creep in.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Very many thanks for yours &amp; for Sir Joseph’s long letters about Ball’s article, which interested me greatly. It is a pity that the substances of these letters were not given as a review, but I daresay that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. dislike reviewing his article severely.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>

                    <p>P.S. I find <hi rend="underline">Anthaerium Violaceum</hi> is just beginning to make numberless aerial roots, so will keep this plant, for chance of success on our return home.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>This is not one of the more precious plants, as I gather from your letter.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>

Some plants had been sent to him on 16 December 1878 and 17 June 1879, but the last record of a plant of <hi rend="italic">Bignonia capreolata</hi> (crossvine) being sent was on 16 May 1878; there is an undated record of the return of the plants sent on 17 June 1879 (<hi rend="italic">Outwards book</hi>, Archives, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, pp. 459, 486, and 503; <hi rend="italic">Inwards book</hi>, p. 164).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The plants sent on 17 June 1879 from Kew had been requested so that CD could study tropic movements in their aerial roots (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12086.xml">letter to W. T. Thiselton-Dyer, 5 June 1879</ref> and n. 2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Thiselton-Dyer’s observations on  <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_261.xml">John Ball</ref>’s paper on the origin of alpine flora (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10815.xml">Ball 1879</ref>) are now missing; see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12114.xml">letter to W.

            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Thiselton-Dyer probably sent a letter with the plants that were sent on 17 June 1879 in which he mentioned which of them were more valuable, but that letter has not been found (see letters to W.
