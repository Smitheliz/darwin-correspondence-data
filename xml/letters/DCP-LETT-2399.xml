<p>I should have acknowledged your letter of the 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> November by last packet had the mail not been more than ordinarily late, leaving only a day for acknowledgments.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I shall not fail to attend to all your requests relative to the naturalized hive and the indigenous Bee,—their honey and their honey comb— A friend who has a fine apiary will put up for me the specimens of the broodless cells you require.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Our Melipona I think on examination will be found to be different from that of Mexico.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Living <anchor xml:id="ann.a1" type="annotationStart"/>specimens were sent to Sir William Jardine by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Edward Chitty, now of the King’s Bench Walk Temple.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Through him you will probably obtain some specific intelligence relating to those native bees.<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> The honey cells are sacklets, the honey dark coloured, and the wax nearly as deep in tint as obsidian. We have a log in the Museum of our Society of Arts containing a living hive at work, and if I do not possess myself of what you desire early, I shall be able from this stock to get for you Specimens</p>
<p>We have the Xylocopa teredo of Lansdowne Guilding.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I shall see if I can procure these. They are rather scarce, but come occasionally under the notice of the Logwood cutters.</p>
<p>I shall enquire generally what are our variety of Social and Solitary Apidæ and let you know. Westwood I see gives us the Apis grossa, but I have never seen it.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> We have a rose-leaf-cutter bee, lining its nest with circular cuttings from the Rose as the Megachile, but in what respect it is specifically distinguished I do not know. All this ignorance serves to render your enquiry very interesting, and therefore a labour of pleasure.</p>
<p>With much respect, I remain | My dear Sir, | Very faithfully your obe<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> Srvt | Richard Hill <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> Charles Darwin Esq<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> FRS.</p>
