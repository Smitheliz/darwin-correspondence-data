<p>I have found out that Haughton is the identical one &amp; indivisible with our Nat. &amp; prejudiced reviewer of the Origin.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> He is certainly a man of large capacity, &amp; that is his special quality— he has taken to the Medical classes lately &amp; turned his attention to poisons,—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> My own impression as regards his strychnine case<ref target="#foot.f3"/> is that it is only a deduction from D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Andersons discovery, some 8 years ago, that one Narcotic &amp;c counteracts another, I do not know where Andersons paper was published, but can enquire &amp; let you know—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Haughton is as I am given to understand a man without any faculties of imagination or discovery.—but a plodder &amp; applies with many horse power brains. He will grapple any subject on a moments notice, &amp; the only thing to be deplored is that some of his friends would not put him up to a wrinkle or two on Theology, &amp; let him get his steam up— wouldn’t he just break things!—</p>
<p>I send the Maize book by Carrier today, &amp; it will go on from Nag’s head tomorrow by your Carrier.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I have a little yesterday from our West Africa collector, he has been across Du Chaillus country &amp; says his accounts are <hi rend="underline">all false.</hi> <ref target="#foot.f6"/> That impudent liar Burton (another Geogr. Soc. protegee) has in a public despatch) filched away all poor Mann’s credit for the ascent of the Cameroons, calls it his Expedition, planned &amp; carried out by him, &amp; calls Mann his volunteer associate.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I never read any thing so gross in my life— Poor Mann had set his heart on this thing for 2 years, had failed the first time, &amp; was actually leaving F. Po. for the ascent when Burton arrived at F. Po as Consul, did leave &amp; had ascended the Mt. several weeks before Burton following him was at its foot; having prepared the way &amp; provided guides &amp; every thing— I am quite disgusted, but hardly know how to act, I dislike &amp; despise the Geogr. Soc. way of going so much that I do not like to bring the matter forward there, &amp; as to having a quarrel with Burton, we all know what it is to touch pitch.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I have some more matters (in your letter) to write about, but they are not at hand here (B. House) where I am examining.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

In the paper, Thomas Anderson, professor of chemistry at the university of Glasgow, and an expert on the chemistry of narcotics, stated (p. 569): <quote type="quote"> The question may be raised as to how far the action of the strychnia may have been affected by the habitual use of opium … In this case, it is just possible that intoxication [with opium] may have prevented the immediate access of symptoms [of strychnine poisoning], exactly as it is known to do in the case of poisoning by opium. </quote></note>

In his account of Mann’s ascent of the Cameroon mountains (J. D. Hooker 1863c, p. 174), Hooker stated: <quote type="quote"> Some of the physical characters of the group have been described in a memorandum transmitted to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by Consul Burton, who accompanied Mr. Mann on his second visit to this group.
