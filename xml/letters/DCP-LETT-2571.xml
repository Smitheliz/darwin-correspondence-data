<p>Had I not been much engaged lately, I should have thanked you earlier for your very kind letter of the 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am quite <hi rend="underline">delighted</hi> that we agree to some extent in our conclusions with respect to the mutability of species.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I shall anxiously read your Cours, if published.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Pray permit me to be boastful about my book, but for a reason which you will presently see. Sir C. Lyell, who has been our chief maintainer of the immutability of species, has become an entire convert; as is Hooker, our best &amp; most philosophical Botanist; as is Carpenter, an excellent physiologist, &amp; as is Huxley; &amp; I could name several other names. These naturalists intend proclaiming their full acceptance of my views. The whole of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Edit (1250 copies) was sold on first day; &amp; my publisher is now printing 3000 more copies.— Madame Belloc having heard of my work from her English friends, wished to translate it into French; but on reading it, she finds it too scientific.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Now this has put it into my head, what an immense advantage it would be, if it were translated. It would then be known to the world. I wish for this far more, (if I know myself) for the sake of the subject, than for my own reputation. Judging from English sale, I think it would answer to a publisher or translator; especially if any distinguished naturalists would look over the proof-sheets, &amp; perhaps append a few notes of refutation or confirmation, &amp; allow his name to appear on title-page.—</p>
<p>I know that you are immersed in original researches, &amp; believe me that I do not presume to think of you; but it has occurred to me that perhaps your kindness &amp; interest in subject would induce you to mention my book to any publisher or translator or eminent naturalist, who might be willing to act as Editor. My publisher has secured the right of translation, which I believe lasts for 2 or 3 months. I would of course send copy of the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> &amp; corrected Edition to any translator. Will you have the extreme kindness to consider this subject; &amp; if in your power confer on me this great &amp; lasting obligation.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I beg you not to waste your valuable time in answering this note, unless you have anything to communicate.</p>
<p>With the highest respect &amp; with my best thanks, I beg leave to remain Dear Sir | Yours faithfully &amp; obliged | Charles Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Quatrefages de Bréau, a disciple of <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3335.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Henri Milne-Edwards</ref>, held a view of transformism based on the developmental processes of organisms (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_205.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Appel 1987</ref>, pp. 234 and 236). Nevertheless, he found it impossible to accept CD’s views. Copies of some of Quatrefages de Bréau’s books, including those in which he developed his ideas of the distinctness of man from the animal world and the single origin of the human races (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6465.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Quatrefages de Bréau 1861</ref> and 1862), are in the Darwin Library--CUL.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Quatrefages de Bréau was appointed professor of the natural history of man at the Muséum d'histoire naturelle in 1855 and delivered his first course of lectures on anthropological subjects in 1856.
