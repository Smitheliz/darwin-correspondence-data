<p>I am very grateful for the very kind answer You gave to my letter;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> in order to occupy as little as possible of your valuable time, I shall be very short and precise in my answer.</p>
<p>I certainly determine on a translation of Your new work, but in reference to woodcuts I could make them as well here, by the artists of the Academy, the more so as I presume that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray will be a little tickled, as an editor, to give to somebody else stereotypes of a work which he has not already finished himself, but if in some short lines, which I expect in answer, you shall give me the permission to apply to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Murray, I shall do so, and if his charches for stereotypes are not much higher than the woodcuts made here, I shall certainly be very glad to receive them beforehand.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> All I shall ask You, dear Sir, is to inform M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Murray, that you have had already the kindness to stipulate with me and accept my propositions, so that, in the very improbable case he should receive a similar proposition, not to accept it, or at least to inform me and give me a little preference.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> For my part, I have made similar conditions, in absence of a litterary treaty, with some continental writers, as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ch. Vogt, Rosmässler, Billroth<ref target="#foot.f5"/> and other, for receiving early printed sheets of some of their works, and shall be very happy to have the same advantage, over other editors who do not like to honour the right of litterary property, also in English books.</p>
<p>It was very foolish to ask You for a special Introduction, not Knowing the public you speak to You shall certainly be at a loss to say something.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Your former book, the “Origin of Species” is translated and printed some three years ago, but I understand that the translation is made not from the original but from the German translation of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Bronn, the late Prof. at Heidelberg, and with his remarks.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Truebner informed me of the conditions You would accept, but I think it shall be better to inform me about it directly, so that I could make a remittance on some London house, for the first half of the first volume.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Dear Sir | Yours faithfully | W. Kowalewsky</p>
