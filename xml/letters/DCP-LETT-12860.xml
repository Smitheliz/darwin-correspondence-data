            <p>Huxley has persuaded JDH that the Wallace memorial may not be hopeless; JDH still has misgivings about Wallace’s spiritualism but will follow CD’s and Huxley’s decision.</p>

                    <p>Huxley spoke to me yesterday about the pension for Wallace, which you proposed to me not very long ago, &amp; which we both thought at the time would be a hopeless attempt under the circumstance of his Spiritualism, &amp; the fact that he had obtained £500 by the bet on the Sphericity of the Globe.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>H. tells me that the bet tells all the other way, for that he believes he gave the money to a charity: &amp; if this be so, which I have no reason to doubt, though he certainly has the credit if the contrary—there remains only the Spiritualism: which should not I think be an objection to urging his claim,—though I am doubtful as to whether it should not be mentioned privately to the Minister. I am writing to Huxley to this effect. ie. asking his opinion.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I need not add that if you &amp; he decide I will follow &amp; do my best.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD had sent <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2486.xml">Thomas Henry Huxley</ref> a draft memorial and a list of potential signatories in support of a civil-list pension for <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4935.xml">Alfred Russel Wallace</ref>; see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12815.xml">letter from T. H. Huxley, 14 November 1880</ref>. For Hooker’s and CD’s previous opinions on Wallace’s chances of a pension, see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 27, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12362.xml">letter from J. D. Hooker, 18 December 1879</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12365.xml">letter to A. B. Buckley, 19 December 1879</ref>. Wallace had denied that natural selection could account for the development of human intelligence and looked to spiritualist explanations; for his interest in spiritualism from the mid-1860s, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4461.xml">Kottler 1974</ref> and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2503.xml">Fichman 2004</ref>, pp. 139–210. In 1870, Wallace, a qualified surveyor, had accepted <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5835.xml">John Hampden’s</ref> challenge to scientific men to prove the convexity of a stretch of inland water, offering £500 if the proof was accepted by an intelligent referee. Wallace’s proof was accepted by the referee, who gave him the £500, but Hampden refused to accept the result and subjected Wallace to a twenty-year campaign of abuse. Although Wallace mostly won the many court battles that resulted, the legal costs were so great that he lost out financially.
