<p rend="left">expression of Emotions in animals” the other day &amp; how certain ideas produce mechanical actions in animals, such as a cat shaking her feet if she was near water though her feet were dry— We were carrying one of our dogs across the river at home sometime ago, directly he got suspended over the water he went through the whole pantomime of swimming though removed considerably above the water.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>The swimming stopped as soon as he was over dry land. I think this as good an instance of the sort as could well be found— I do not know whether you have heard that Balfour<ref target="#foot.f3"/> has not been very well— He &amp; Spencer Lyttelton are <hi rend="italic">[several lines excised]</hi> the religious feelings <hi rend="italic">[half a line excised]</hi> university. The university ought to be the body to elucidate difficulties, &amp; settle disputes, if religious disputes can be settled at all. I believe the Bill will pass but it is uncertain yet. If it does not I suppose parliament will be dissolved.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I read the book the review of which you saw—Joshua Davidson. I do not think you would care for it.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Some people consider it very profane, but I think it is simply very tiresome &amp; like an enormous tract. Religious enthusiasm seems to be at a high pitch in London</p>

This letter was probably enclosed with George’s letter to Emma of [early March 1873] (DAR 210.2: 27). George wrote, ‘I send an anecdote for Father wh. Elliot sent me &amp; I’ve no doubt he might use it if he liked’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Elliot may refer either to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_258.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Maitland Balfour</ref> or to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5878.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Arthur James Balfour</ref>, both of whom, together with George Darwin, had been his contemporaries at Trinity College, Cambridge.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The third Irish bill, ‘a bill to reform Irish universities by broadening the basis of Roman Catholic attendance’, was defeated in a vote in Parliament on 11 March 1873, forcing the resignation of the prime minister, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1883.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Ewart Gladstone</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5933.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3060.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">George William Spencer Lyttelton</ref> was Gladstone’s assistant principal private secretary.</note>

(<hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Circular</hi> 1872, p. 805). The book’s central character, Joshua Davidson, was a reincarnation of Jesus, who had returned to Victorian England as a communist; it was written as an attack on the Anglican Church. An annotation probably in George Darwin’s hand reads, ‘It is written I believe by the same author as Jinx’s Baby’: <hi rend="italic">Ginx’s baby: his birth and other misfortunes</hi> had been published by the same company in 1870 but was written by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5999.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Edward Jenkins</ref>.</note>
