<p>My conscience smote me much on receiving your letter.— The reason I did not write sooner, was that I kept on hoping that I might have come in propriâ personâ.— I am at present mad about Geology &amp; I daresay I shall put a plan which I am now hatching, into execution sometime in August, viz of riding through Wales &amp; staying a few days at Barmouth on my road.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Even if I was to come there, I should not be of much assistance to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D. B. or indeed M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. D B to me, as I much suspect his pronunciation.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I get on very slowly with Spanish. the number of words is quite terrifying &amp; the number of meanings to each word is still more discouraging.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I must contrive to pay you a visit, &amp; as for Lowe, the number of facts he must have picked up, must be worth any thing.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I heard a Coachman the other day call a broken-winded, spavined horse, a “faggot of misery”. I thought to myself, the man must be a friend of Lowes. I heard from Watkins yesterday<ref target="#foot.f6"/> he says, he finds them so devilish familiar at home, that he is obliged to take a little tour in order to protect himself.— He intends seeing Grey &amp; Cavendish at Tremadock, &amp; most likely Barmouth.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I should like much to meet him there With Lowes assistance, we might have a good deal of instructing conversation.—</p>
<p>You do not deserve even so long a letter, as I have written. You do not even mention how you like Barmouth, whom you have there, what you do &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c.— I think I shall most certainly see you in August<ref target="#foot.f8"/> till then, believe me dear Whitley | yours Chas Darwin.—</p>
