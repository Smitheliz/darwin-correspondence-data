<p>I am very greatly obliged for your kindness in sending me copies of the <hi rend="underline">Bonatea</hi> paper. They reached me yesterday morning. I am very glad that the Linnean Society has at length published the paper, and do not doubt that I owe its having done so to your recommendation.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Fitch has copied my sketches with his usual accuracy.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The only thing that does not clearly appear in the lithograph is the aspect of the caudicles of pollinia <hi rend="underline">in situ</hi> in figures A &amp; B. The caudicles are rather conspicuous in nature, owing to their bright-yellow colour, and the line of their inverting membrane is rather marked, immediately within the reverted edge of the horns of rostellum, as shown in Fig. C.</p>
<p>I rejoice to observe that the address on the cover of the packet is in your own writing, as it leads me to think that your health must be better again.</p>
<p>I have done nothing in Orchid observation lately, or I should have written to you.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Yesterday, I looked through a series of drawings of Natal Orchids made by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Sanderson for D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Harvey.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> They are very characteristic, but in most cases lack the careful detail so essential for studying the mode of fertilisation.</p>
<p>I regret to see D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lindley’s death announced in the English newspapers: botanical Science in England can ill spare such an able and devoted leader.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Since I last wrote to you, I have paid a hurried visit to Mauritius. I was of course greatly interested in the Island and its productions; &amp; I was fortunate in finding such friendly &amp; hospitable naturalists as Sir Henry Barkly and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Newton there.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> My time was too short to do much, and was principally devoted to the collection of Lepidoptera. I think I have pretty clearly established that the Butterflies (at least) of Mauritius are all but one natives of Africa or Madagascar, &amp; mostly of both Island &amp; Continent. I am preparing a short paper on the subject.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I was longing to visit Madagascar when in so close proximity to it, but could not arrange to do so.</p>
<p>I suppose you have heard of the very curious Raptorial Bird sent to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gurney by Andersson.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have not seen it (there was but a single specimen), but it appears to combine the different characters of most of the chief groups of Raptores with the wide gape of a Goatsucker. Its flying by twilight &amp; feeding on <hi rend="underline">bats</hi> are also remarkable facts.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Andersson says that he only saw this solitary specimen during all his travels.</p>
<p>Sir H. Barkly &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Newton have both written to me about the great <hi rend="underline">Dodo</hi> discovery in Mauritius: there seems to be no doubt about the remains being really those of <hi rend="underline">Didus ineptus</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>With kind regards | Believe me yours very truly | Roland Trimen</p>

CD had been introduced to Andersson by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1797.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Galton</ref>, who had organised an expedition with Andersson to Lake Ngami, South Africa, in 1850 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2159.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DSAB</hi></ref>).

The specimen, later identified as <hi rend="italic">Macheiramphus alcinus</hi> (bat hawk), had been shot by a servant of Andersson’s. The bird’s stomach contained a bat, and on this basis the bird was believed to be nocturnal or semi-nocturnal in habit. The specimen was deposited in the Norwich Museum, of which Gurney was a leading patron (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3222.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gurney 1865</ref>, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5514.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Modern English biography</hi></ref>).</note>
