<p>I am indeed pleased with the last Edition of the Journal, which you have so kindly sent me; both outside &amp; inside are engaging. How doubly interesting you have made it to the common reader! I was so taken with the account of the poor Fuegians that I sat up I cannot say how long, till you bade farewell to Woollya &amp; I went to bed quite melancholy at the fate of poor Fuegia Basket, doubtless too truly told in the cruel footnote at p. 229.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>You have puzzled me beyond measure with one of your plants, it is a beautiful pea-flower from Cape Tres Montes, the only<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> one of the kind from there; (another handsome pea-flower <hi rend="underline">Lathyrus pubescens</hi>, is from Chonos Archip.) this is nothing more nor less than <hi rend="underline">Lathyrus maritimus</hi>, a rare English plant found on all the N.W. coast of Europe, from the Channell to Archangel, Iceland, Shetlands Greenland &amp; always littoral, in Asia it nowhere appears on <hi rend="underline">this</hi> side the Okhotsk M<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi>., i.e. at Kamschatka, it being replaced throughout Siberia &amp; Russia (barring Archangel) by a similar but very distinct species. In America it commences at Oregon, runs up to Kotzebues sound inhabits the shores of all the great lakes &amp; banks of the great rivers across the continent &amp; on the E. coast is found from Labrador to N. York: behold its range! now what on earth brought it to Cape Tres-Montes of all places the only one South of 40<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> N.?. It is not a pot-herb, &amp; the idea of its introduction by man is almost untenable. Our Chilian collections are so extensive, that I am sure it is nowhere in S. Am. but Tres Montes. Your specimens are good: <anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>read me this riddle. Its Geog. distrib. in the North cost me many hours hunting &amp; comparing specimens as it has brethren apt to be mistaken for it in the N., but nothing like it in South.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The “Anne Pink” cannot have brought it?, as Cook did the coral to Endeavour River (have you heard of that?)<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Are you sure that it is established “that plants propagated by buds, all partake of a common duration of life.—? v. p 203 of Journal.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>An now for species. To begin, I do think it a most fair &amp; most profitable subject for discussion, I have no formed opinion of my own on the subject, I argue for immutability, till I see cause to take a fixed post.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> A knowledge of Botany <hi rend="underline">alone</hi> will never clear up the question &amp; alas I can bring nothing else to bear upon it, my Geology is nil: &amp; thus you see I am ever ready to make it subservient to Botany instead of Botany to it, as must be the true relation. Do not think I<anchor xml:id="ann.a4" type="annotationEnd"/> <anchor xml:id="ann.a5" type="annotationStart"/>meant to insinuate that you could not be a judge from not having worked out species, for your having collected with judgement is working out species: what I meant I still maintain, that to be able to handle the subject at all, one must have handled hundreds of species with a view to distinguishing them &amp; that over a great part,—or brought from a great many parts,—of the globe. These elements your toils have fulfilled &amp; well, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Gerard is neither a specific naturalist, nor a collector, nor a traveller, what the —— is he then? nothing but a distorter of facts; or what is as bad; a compiler without judgement. His work always has its value though, as a collection of <hi rend="underline">instances</hi> which you will make better use of I doubt not.</p>
<p>I am sure your Geology is most moderate, &amp; I would safely subscribe to the Patagonian plains being once under water &amp; to the “Strait of Darwin” up by the river S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Cruz. Your evidence to my unskilled eyes at any rate is positive, Forbes’ is theory, but untill I<anchor xml:id="ann.a6" type="annotationEnd"/> <ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a1" type="annotationStart"/>I am happy to think that this letter won’t cost you much thinking.</p>
