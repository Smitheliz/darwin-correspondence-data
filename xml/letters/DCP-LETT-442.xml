<p>I do believe there are few pieces of intelligence that could have delighted me more than that which your letter of day contains, and you may be assured of the warmest congratulations of both M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henslow and myself— That your fit of <hi rend="underline">insanity </hi> may long continue is my sincere wish, but pray don’t let me hear a word of the <hi rend="underline">calamities</hi> of domestic life, all such matters ought now to appear to you en couleur de rose, and if it is your Intention in future to resign <hi rend="underline">all such</hi> cares to your fair Lady, it strikes me you do not intend to trouble <hi rend="underline">yourself</hi> about them henceforward, <hi rend="underline">under such circumstances</hi> I do not doubt you will prove a most <hi rend="underline">dutiful</hi> husband, joking apart, I cannot help observing, what you are not to take as a compliment, because they tell me I never paid but two in my life, that I think Miss Wedgewood a very fortunate being; and that she has every reason to look forward to as great a share of matrimonial happiness as falls to the lot of most people. I am glad to hear it is your intention to reside in town, I feel that we have not quite lost sight of you, had you told me you were going to take up your abode in Shropshire, why then—I wonder if I should have read your letter with the disinterested satisfaction I ought to have done— Now I am on the subject of <hi rend="underline">Selfishness!, </hi> I must just say, that I do hope this event will not put a stop to the visit M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henslow has held out hopes of, of your coming to us at Christmas. I am sure you must require a great deal of information on household matters, so pray come, and talk it all over—</p>
<p>Believe me | Very Sincerely Yrs | H Henslow</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Henslow returned from Hitcham yesterday—</p>
