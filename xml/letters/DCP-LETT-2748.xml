<p>Will you forgive me for troubling you with a question, which I presume it is extremely unlikely that you can answer; but I imagine you would be more likely to answer it than anyone.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am anxious to ascertain what little I can of the history of some of our most strongly marked breeds of domestic animals; &amp; it has occurred to me as possible that archæologists may know when our gigantic dray or waggon Horses were first recorded or noticed. There might be old drawings of heavy carts with horses not so heavy as our present ones or some such evidence, that <hi rend="underline">heavy</hi> cart-horses did not exist at a given date.— I have read that the old knights in armour rode very powerful horses, but I presume they were not waggon-horses.</p>
<p>Do you know anyone, whom you meet at the archæological Societies, who could throw any light on this point, if it has never occurred to you?<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Would it be of any use to put a question in Notes &amp; Queries?—though that is a periodical I have no means of seeing.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> If you cannot aid me, do not trouble yourself by answering this; as I write it on the bare chance of your being able to give me some information.</p>
<p>It is a very long time since we met.— Eheu Eheu, the old Crux Major days are long past.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I sincerely hope that you are well in health.</p>
<p>Believe me Dear Way | Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
