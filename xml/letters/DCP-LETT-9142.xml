<p>Will you thank M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Balfour for his letter which I was extremely glad to receive, as I had heard nothing of Dohrn’s affairs.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have had a long interview with Huxley, and he thinks that nothing can be done without first communicating with D.,—More especially as he might object that a subscription might shake the credit of the concern   As Huxley has already discussed the subject with D. he will write again, and communicate the result to us. I am strongly of opinion that a letter from me expressing a high opinion of the value of the Z. Station would be a very insufficient means for obtaining subscriptions, and might appear highly presumptious on my part.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Therefore I think that it would be almost necessary to get the signatures of a few well-known good men, whether or not they would subscribe.— Accordingly I have drawn up a rough draft of a circular, not binding those who sign it to subscribe. Huxley approves of this, and says he would sign it; and this I think is a great gain. He has taken a copy and will forward it to Dohrn for his approval.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> There is another advantage in the plan of a circular, namely that the insufferable disagreeableness of begging for subscriptions will be avoided; though of course a personal application with the circular would always give it much greater weight.</p>
<p>It could be sent to persons, and they could be asked for their names, if they did not wish to subscribe. My rough draft will no doubt require much modification. From ill health and overwork I cannot offer to do more than to suggest some names, if the plan of the circular is carried out. You will think that the sum that I am willing to subscribe, viz £50, is very small, but after reflecting what I have had to subscribe this year, I do not think that I ought to give more. As you are not a naturalist your subscription strikes me as very liberal. The list of members of the Royal, Linnean, and Ray Socs<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> would be useful for suggesting names. Would it be worth while to send a circular, if this plan adopted, to the <hi rend="underline">Duke of Devonshire</hi> and the <hi rend="underline">Marquis Salisbury</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> But I will hereafter think of some names.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>PS. | Please to shew this letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Balfour and Forster<ref target="#foot.f7"/> and any one else</p>
