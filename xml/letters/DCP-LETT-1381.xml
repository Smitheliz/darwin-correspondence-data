                <div type="transcription">
<p>I thank you very sincerely for your very kind remembrance of me &amp; my cirripedial pursuits; I have no doubt in due time I shall receive the curious unattached cirripede from off Borneo.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>With respect to Bell,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> allow me to assure you that when I asked him for pamphlet for you, he expressed the most lively pleasure in being able to send to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, anything you required. On the other hand, he is overwhelmed with professional work &amp; with his Secretaryship of the Royal Soc: moreover he is apt to be a dilatory correspondent, as I have found him on several occasion, but at the same time, I really believe a more goodnatured, kind-hearted man does not exist.— Upon the whole I doubt whether he <hi rend="underline">could</hi> enter into a long correspondence with any person, but I feel pretty sure he would be more interesting in writing to you than to almost any other Naturalist in the world.— I have given my opinion with the utmost frankness as far as my judgment goes.—</p>
<p>I thank you particularly for calling my attention to the union of the prehensile antennæ of the larvæ of Cirripedes, in relation to a similar structure in other Crustacea.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have attended particularly to this attachment of the antennæ, but I can consider it only as it were an accident due to the attachment of both antennæ &amp; the immediately surrounding parts, to the supporting surface.— I doubt how far this attachment can be called organic (though I have put by specimens in order to examine further into this point); the cementing stuff generally presents no trace of structure, though sometimes in its early stages it consists of a mass of cells. Would it be asking too great a favour to beg you to send me one or more specimens (if not very rare) of any crustacea thus attached <hi rend="underline">&amp; still adherent</hi> to a fish, or other body?<ref target="#foot.f4"/> How is the exuviation managed in the Lernææ with the united prehensile legs? I feel the greatest interest on this point; for I have found such wonderfully diverse forms in the class Cirripedia, that I have been driven to one character, namely their means of attachment, by a cement (<hi rend="italic">[reverse question mark]</hi>.tissue?) which first comes out of the prehensile antennæ of the larvæ, &amp; subsequently through special apertures, (varying remarkably in the different families, &amp; even genera) formed usually at each fresh exuviation. But the strangest point is that this cement is conveyed by a duct leading from a gland, which is nothing but <hi rend="underline">a modified part or continuation of one of the ovarian</hi> <hi rend="underline">branches</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I do <hi rend="doubleUnderline">not</hi> expect you to believe me, though I feel pretty sure of my accuracy; perhaps you will be so kind as not to mention this fact as I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to publish myself this one little point. Hence it is that I am anxious to know how any parasitic crustacea are attached, or how the limbs are attached to each other; from what I had read, I had thought it was exclusively effected by claws to the fish.—</p>
<p>Pray forgive the length of this letter, &amp; accept my sincere thanks for all your kindness | Believe me | Your’s very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
