<p>Your letter has filled me with consternation.— I never knew anything so stupid as my making such a mistake.— I have lost your letter, but I have no doubt you are right.— If I merely trusted to recollection, I should yet think it was 7’12.— But after the little swindling affair with your brother, I will not trust my own self: It is too bad of me to give you so much unnecessary trouble, but perhaps you can find out the prices of the principal things such as paper &amp; binding books, &amp; that will be sufficient to know which of the sums it is.— I can easily through my brother contrive to pay you.— I am very much obliged for your directions about consingment.— I believe most of the things will first go to Falmouth (where I must get an agent), &amp; then to Cambridge.— I will tell my Father that you will send him a note with an account of what you pay for me.—and I do not think you will find him as careless as I am.— I hope to be able to assist the Philosoph. Society when I come back.—but from all I hear, I suppose I shall be in honor bound to give largely to British Museum.— Every thing here goes on very prosperously. My beau ideal of a Captain is determined to make me as comf〈ort〉able as he possibly can.— But the corner of the cabin, which is my private property, is most wofully small.— I have just room to turn round &amp; that is all.— My friend the Doctor<ref target="#foot.f1"/> is an ass, but we jog on very amicably: at present he is in great tribulation, whether his cabin shall be painted French Grey or a dead white— I hear little excepting this subject from him.— The gun-room officers are a fine set of fellows, but rather rough, &amp; their conversation is oftentimes so full of slang &amp; sea phrases that it is as unintelligible as Hebrew to me.— Our Cabins are fitted most luxuriously with nothing except Mahogany: in short, every thing is going on as well possible. I only wish they were a little faster.— I am afraid we shall not bonâ fide sail till 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of next Month.— I want your advice de Mathematicis. After looking at my 11 books of Euclid, &amp; first part of Algebra (including binomial theorem?) I may then begin Trigonometry after which must I begin Spherical? are there any important parts in the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> &amp; 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> <hi rend="underline">parts</hi> of Woods Algebra.— It is almost a shame to ask you, but I should be much obliged if you would write to me pretty soon.— You must be very busy; for if Mess<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Askew<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; Darnell<ref target="#foot.f3"/> have not got some fresh Brains in the vacation, they will give you some trouble:—</p>
<p>What an important Epoch 1831 will be in my life. taking one degree, &amp; starting for Patagonia are each in their respective way memorable events.— And you have been most instrumental in getting them both.— Remember me most kindly to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Henslow.—Leonard Jenyns &amp; all other friends.— I often think of your good advice of taking all uncomfortable moments as matters of course, &amp; not to be compared with all the lasting &amp; solid advantages:— Indeed I never can do better than when I think of you &amp; your advice</p>
<p>Ever yours my dear Henslow | Most affectionately | Chas. Darwin</p>
<p>You give me your brother direction <hi rend="underline">12</hi> Clements Inn. Is that right?</p>
