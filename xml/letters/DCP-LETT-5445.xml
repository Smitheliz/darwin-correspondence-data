<p>It is a long time since I have written, but I cannot boast that I have refrained from charity towards you, but from having lots of work. I am so much obliged to you for telling me about the palm seeds. I have got a whole string of cases equally, or perhaps more curious, but yours is infinitely the most valuable from having been observed by first rate judges.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The subject is of paramount importance for my beloved Pangenesis.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Now c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> you obtain permission for me from Naudin to insert some such paragraph as the enclosed.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> My book will not appear till next Nov. but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have to insert the passage in the proof sheet in about a month’s time. Help me if you can. Are they seeds or nuts? Correct the word if they are not seeds.</p>
<p>It is great news about the presidentship; I am very sorry for it, tho’ you seem to keep up your spirits.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> You ask what I have been doing; nothing but blackening proofs with corrections.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I do not believe any man in England naturally writes so vile a style as I do. The only fact which I have lately ascertained, &amp; about which I dont know whether you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> care, is that a great excess of, or very little pollen produced not the least difference in the average number, weight, or period of germination in the seeds of Ipomœa.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I remember saying the contrary to you &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Smith<ref target="#foot.f8"/> at Kew. But the result is now clear from a great series of trials. On the other hand seeds from this plant, fertilised by pollen from the same flower, weigh less, produce dwarfer plants, but indisputably <hi rend="underline">germinate quicker</hi> than seeds produced by a cross between two distinct plants.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>In your paper on Insular Floras (p. 9) there is what I must think an error, which I before pointed out to you; viz you say that the plants which are wholly distinct from those of nearest continent are often <hi rend="underline">very</hi> <hi rend="underline">common</hi>, instead of very rare.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Etty,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> who has read your paper with great interest, was confounded by this sentence. By the way I have stumbled on two old notes, one that 22 species of European birds occasionally arrive as <hi rend="underline">chance</hi> wanderer, to the Azores, &amp; secondly the trunks of American trees have been known to be washed on shores of Canary isl<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, by gulf stream, which returns southward from the Azores.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>What poor papers those of A. Murray are in G. Chronicle: what conclusions he dreams from a single Carabus &amp; that a widely ranging genus!<ref target="#foot.f13"/> He seems to me conceited: you &amp; I are fair game geologically, but he refers to Lyell, as if his opinion on a geological point was worth no more than his own.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> I have just bought, but not read a sentence of, Murray’s big book, second-hand for 30<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>, <hi rend="doubleUnderline">new</hi>, so I do not envy the publishers.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> It is clear to me that the man cannot reason.—</p>
<p>I have had a very nice letter from Scott at Calcutta:<ref target="#foot.f16"/> he has been making some good observations on the acclimatisation of seeds from plants of same species, grown in different countries; &amp; likewise on how far European plants will stand the climate of Calcutta; he says he is astonished how well some flourish, &amp; he maintains, if the land were unoccupied, several could easily cross, spreading by seed, the Tropics from N. to South; so he knows how to please me, but I have told him to be cautious, else he will have Dragons down on him.—<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>I was going to have asked you what sort of a man Benj. Clarke was (I bought his book out of kindness) but I see A. Gray calls him “that ass”. He is now going to publish analogous views on Animals, &amp; I have subscribed.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> He tells me that no single person has or can object to his views on plants; I suspected that perhaps no one noticed them.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> He tells me a wonderful story of the effects of an inherited mutilation from cutting off the upper half of the ears of wheat for only 3 generations, which I cannot believe; &amp; I have told him no one would believe it, unless he repeat &amp; rerepeats his experiment.—<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
