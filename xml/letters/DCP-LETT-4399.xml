            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Hooker may refer to regulations regarding associate members that resulted from new bye-laws established in 1861; these limited associates to twenty-five in number and to ‘such persons as usually reside in the British Dominions’ (1861 Charter and Byelaws of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> of London, Chapter 5, Section 2, Library of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref>). Hooker may also refer to a resolution that he had submitted as a vice-president of the Council of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> regarding election of associates; this was adopted by the Council on 6 March 1862 and required associates living in or near London to attend a certain number of meetings, while those living at a greater distance were required to make one scientific communication each year. If these conditions were not met, after three years the associate was to withdraw (‘Resolution of Council regarding election of Associates’, 6 March 1862, Library of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref>, and Gage and Stearn 1988, pp. 59, 61; see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4405.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 9 February [1864]</ref>and n. 8). The associateship was an honour that was restricted to those who were not financially able to offer their candidacy and whose work as naturalists was expected to benefit the Society (Gage and Stearn 1988, p. 198).</note>
