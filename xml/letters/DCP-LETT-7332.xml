                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>This most horrid war put me entirely out of my regular work and in fact out of order. The very day when your letter (Aug 18.) reached Leipzig I was on the outset to France, not being able to spare one minute to answer it.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I took three railway-carriages full of hospital materials with me to distribute amongst the hospitals round Metz and up to Sedan.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Then I conducted three hundred wounded to Saxony and did not stop here but a few hours to return again to Douzy with new things.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The impressions I got there were so woeful and melancholy that I really wanted some time to get them over and to force myself to the daily work. Pray don’t be angry, that I left your kind letter unanswered for such a length of time; but in fact I could not write.</p>
<p>When I returned the second time I found a letter of the publisher asking me to begin the translation as soon as possible.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I perfectly agree with him, that the war will not interfere the least with the success of your new book in a german form. People are anxious to find a safe refuge in science, they begin to get tired of the constant excitements brought about by telegrams and shocking war-tales. The results of your work will become a permanent part of the scientific conscience and not be looked over and forgotten as the infallibility will be. The worst of it could only be that it might sell at a less quick rate. But this is a matter of the publisher’s. And as he insists on bringing the book out as soon as possible (—and he hopes to be able to bring the first volume at the same time with the original—) I cannot but submit to his judgement.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>You would therefore oblige me and the publisher exceedingly if you would be so kind as to <hi rend="underline">send me the corrected sheets as soon as possible</hi> in the same way as you kindly sent me the sheets of the “Variation under Domestication.”<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>The success of the German armies are indeed wonderful. But after all I may ask if the struggle for superiority between the Romanic and Teutonic race, both taken in the widest sense, could not be fought out in some other form more appropriate to the high standing of their respective culture and civilisation. It is a most dreaful ‘struggle for existence’ and the only philosophical comfort is that whatever happens, <hi rend="underline">must</hi> have happened, for without being a necessary consequence of natural conditions it could not happen   But for a sensible mind this “nil admirari” is a very hard thing!<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I hope with all my heart that we will soon have peace.</p>
<p>Scientific work is just like oil smoothing down the rolling waves of political and national excitement. I trust you will kindly help me to steady my thoughts again.</p>
<p>Believe me | My dear Sir | Yours very sincerely. | J. Victor Carus</p>
