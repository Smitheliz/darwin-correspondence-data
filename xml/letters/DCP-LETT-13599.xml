<p>I must write a few lines to thank you for your letter of Dec. 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, though I have nothing particular to say.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Your appreciation of Balfour’s book has pleased me excessively, for though I could not properly judge of it, yet it seemed to me one of the most remarkable books which has been published for some considerable time.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He is quite a young man &amp; if he keeps his health, will do splendid work. He is the younger brother of a Scotch man A. Balfour M.P. of immense fortune &amp; nephew to a very grand gentleman, the Marquis of Salisbury.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> He has a fair fortune of his own, so that he can give up his whole time to Biology. He is very modest &amp; very pleasant, &amp; often visits here, &amp; we like him very much.</p>
<p>Your Pontederia case is very curious: when writing the Origin, of Species what a fine <hi rend="underline">instance</hi> it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have been of one species beating out another, &amp; under the apparent disadvantage of the mid-styled form alone having been introduced.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>As you speak of the seedlings varying I suppose that you feel sure that a suspicion which crossed my mind, of hybrid origin is groundless.— It is also very odd about the seeding &amp; the appearance of the long-styled form. I never saw such oddly-coloured petals which arrived quite brightly coloured.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Your Janira seems a very curious &amp; interesting case; &amp; with what exquisite clearness, you have drawn all its exterior organs.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>I have been working at the effects of Carbonate of Ammonia on roots, the chief result being that with certain plants the cells of the roots, though not differing from one another at all in appearance in fresh thin slices, yet are found to differ <hi rend="underline">greatly</hi> in the nature of their contents, if immersed for some hours in a weak solution of C. of Ammonia.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>My dear Sir | yours ever sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>I remember once suggesting to you to write ‘a Journal of a naturalist in Brazil’ or some such title, &amp; give in it a resume of your endless &amp; most interesting observations; I wish that my suggestion would bear fruit.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>P.S— I have just had to look to Bentham &amp; Hookers Genera, &amp; this has reminded me that I do not at all know whether I have completed your set. If you care to have any parts not sent, I beg you to let me hear.— Hooker tells me that they have nearly completed the Monocotyledons, &amp; that the Palms, Grasses &amp; Orchideæ were fearfully hard work. The Palms took 2 years.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

In his now missing letter of 2 December 1881, Müller had evidently discussed a species of <hi rend="italic">Pontederia</hi> (pickerel-weed) in which only one form had been introduced to an area (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13593.xml">letter from Fritz Müller, 1 January 1882</ref> and n. 4). The species was probably <hi rend="italic">P. crassipes</hi> (a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Eichhornia crassipes</hi>, common water hyacinth); Müller later discussed it in a short paper, ‘Einige Eigenthümlichkeiten der <hi rend="italic">Eichhornia crassipes</hi>’ (Some characteristics of <hi rend="italic">Eichhornia crassipes</hi>; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10372.xml">F.

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">Müller had probably sent seeds of crosses between long- and mid-styled plants of <hi rend="italic">Pontederia crassipes</hi> with his letter of 2 December 1881 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13593.xml">letter from Fritz Müller, 1 January 1882</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Müller’s description of a species he identified as belonging to the isopod genus <hi rend="italic">Janira</hi> was evidently in his now missing letter of 2 December 1881.

Müller 1892</ref>). <hi rend="italic">Janira</hi> was a genus with only marine species, but Müller’s species was found in fresh water and was notable for its distinctive antennae. </note>

CD repeated the suggestion in a letter of <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10384.xml">[9 February 1876]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 24).</note>

The Orchideae (a synonym of Orchidaceae, orchids) was a large section completed by Bentham in August 1880, after which he worked on the Cyperaceae (sedges), finished in October 1880; the Gramineae (a synonym of Poaceae, grasses) formed the last section, which Bentham finished in late 1881 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7421.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Stearn 1956</ref>, p. 130; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11438.xml">Bentham 1881</ref>). Hooker was working on palms (Palmae, a synonym of Arecaceae); see Bentham and Hooker 1862–83, 3 (2): 870–948.
