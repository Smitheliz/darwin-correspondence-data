            <p>Will leave Cambridge shortly after division; plans to return for next term. With so many friends, Henslow among the foremost, it will be pleasant.</p>

<p>I should have answered your last letter earlier, as indeed was necessary to redeem my character.— I waited till I could hear from Baker; but the rogue has not yet been to my rooms; although I wrote to him.— I shall be very glad to be of any use in paying your bills &amp; will make enquiries as you may direct me. NB. I owe you at present <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>1"4"6.— I paid Markham Bennet for Porterage, which makes a shilling or two difference from my last account to you.— I do not quite understand your last letter is Orridge &amp; Aikens account a different affair? &amp; now for giving you a scolding. I should like to know what you mean by such expressions as “begetting a horror of my handwriting” &amp;c, is it a very refined species of irony? does it mean, if your very agreeable letters (I am forced to flatter in order to excuse myself) are horrible, that mine must be à fortiori, most intolerably horrible?— To use your own expression, no more humbug. I am always very gld to receive your letter &amp; you know it, &amp; in Johnsons language “there is an end of it.”—</p>
<p>I shall leave Cambridge a little time after division, my duty draws me away; my inclination would keep me all the next terms, &amp; <hi rend="underline">if</hi> I possibly can, most certainly I shall stay up the greater part of next term.— I have so many friends up here (Henslow amongst the foremost) that it would make any place pleasant.— (NB you always spell Henslow with an e).—</p>
<p>Is there any hope of your coming up next term, if there is we will most cer- tainly meet.— I will 〈wr〉ite again, when I have settled your affairs 〈h〉ere.— You ask after Eras 〈    〉 we never correspond excepting on business.— He is in London, &amp; now you know as much as I do.—</p>
<p>I could not write a long letter even to Charlotte Wedgwood or Fanny Owen, so must excuse this short one.— &amp; Believe me dear old Fox | Your most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Simpson’s direction is Feversham Kent.— do write to him, he will be so glad to hear from you.</p>
