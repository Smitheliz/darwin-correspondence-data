<p>I am very much obliged to you for your interesting letter of Jan 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I was aware that the cells of Bees varied a little in dimensions, but did not in the least know to what a degree the variability extended.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Your statements make the proposition of some, I think, French savant that the size of the cell sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be the standard of all measurements, quite ludicrous.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> This variability of size agrees well with the view which we both I think take of all instincts.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Your case of the 2 cells separated by a flat bottom appears to me particularly interesting.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>As so much has been written of late about Bees cells, I cannot but think that your facts w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be well worth publishing in a separate paper: should you intend doing so, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be grateful for a copy.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I had not heard of the fossil tadpole-nests,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> nor of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Puttnam’s paper on the cells of humble bees; I wish he had sent me a copy of it.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>With respect to your remark that the hexagonal cell always results from the co-operation of several bees, you must remember the comb began by the solitary female wasp.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> F. Smith of the Brit. Museum has lately adduced in Proc. of Ent. Soc. of London several cases of hexagonal combs made by single insects, &amp; others with hexagonal cells at the extreme circumference;<ref target="#foot.f10"/> But in the specimens which I have seen, the hexagons were not very perfect at the circumference. I am glad that you have been attending a little to this subject; I formerly found it very interesting but I have not looked over my notes for several years.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I may add that Prof. Miller carefully measured for me the thickness of the cell-walls &amp; found great variability in their thickness.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> With my best thanks for your kindness in writing</p>
<p>I remain dear Sir yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>

In successive editions of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, CD modified his account of the cell-making instinct of the hive-bee to incorporate evidence of variability in the structure of cells (see Peckham ed. 1959, pp. 52, 54, 402–12).

On pendulums and their limitations as standards of measurement, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5088.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">McGreevy 1995</ref>, 1: 140–2.

CD had argued in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 224–7, that the regular shape of the individual cell of the hive-bee, with its pyramidal base, is due to the way that the cells are aggregated to form the comb.</note>
