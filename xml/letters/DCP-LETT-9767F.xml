<p>Is writing confidentially not to justify the passage referred to [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">9759</hi>], which he much regrets, but to state facts. He never intended any personal hostility to [George] Darwin and seeks advice about how to make reparation.</p>

<p>I thank you for your consideration in selecting the channel through which to convey the message I have received.</p>
<p>I do not write to justify the passage referred to (the writing of which has since caused me more pain and regret than anything I have before written) but for two reasons:</p>
<p>First because I think, on account of past matters to which I have too lately referred to repeat myself now, that a reply is due from me to you.</p>
<p>Secondly to make a certain statement of facts which I ask your patience to consider and leave the result in your hands.</p>
<p>Extracts and notes for the article referred to were written out by me long ago and taken with me abroad for use of the opportunity offered. Amongst them were notes on Mr. Darwin’s article which I read before I left England and did not take with me any more than the other works referred to or reviewed.</p>
<p>When I wrote out, at Dresden, my MS. for the Quarterly, I unhappily trusted to my notes which I believed at the time to be fully justified, though I now think they were <hi rend="underline">not</hi> and that the impression left on my mind by Mr. Darwin’s paper was more vivid than a careful consideration of his words warranted.</p>
<p>Of course I need not say that I <hi rend="underline">never</hi> <hi rend="underline">dreamed</hi> of implying anything whatever <hi rend="underline">against</hi> <hi rend="underline">Mr. Darwin</hi> <hi rend="underline">personally</hi> as it is most certain that persons of the higest character may advocate principles without in the slightest degree realizing their consequences, from which, in fact they would be the first to shrink with horror.</p>
<p>After my return to England I made enquiry as to the article and found it was just going to press, the opportunity was offered me of looking over it which I stupidly declined to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>I had not read it for months and of the particular passages (including the one referred to) I had no distinct recollection.</p>
<p>When I read it as published I was startled and vexed fearing it might give rise to misconstruction— I regretted it, as I still regret it all the more because the article not appearing as <hi rend="underline">mine</hi> I was precluded from that <hi rend="underline">sort</hi> of apology and reparation which I have, especially <hi rend="underline">since October</hi>, felt to be due to Mr. Darwin. For when I read <hi rend="underline">his</hi> letter in August I certainly felt that he had erred and misunderstood me (in saying that I had written what was ‘<hi rend="underline">absolutely</hi>’ ‘false’) as much as <hi rend="underline">I</hi> had misread <hi rend="underline">him</hi>.</p>
<p>I have however long determined that apology and reparation should be made to Mr. Darwin <hi rend="underline">in</hi> <hi rend="underline">my</hi> <hi rend="underline">own</hi> <hi rend="underline">name</hi>, as a simple act of justice at the very first opportunity and if you can suggest to me a mode in which it can be performed I shall be grateful but if you decline I shall none the less seize the first opportunity to perform it.</p>
<p>In brief, I have, through the warmth of feeling engendered by a controversy I deem <hi rend="underline">most</hi> <hi rend="underline">important</hi>, committed a fault I bitterly regret.</p>
<p>I frankly acknowledge having done so and am anxious as far as I can to repair it. I do not know what more I <hi rend="underline">can</hi> do, but whatever the result, I have at least the satisfaction of knowing that what I wrote was at least free from every atom of <hi rend="underline">personal hostility</hi> and that whatever your decision as to the future I cannot be deprived of those pleasant memories of the past which will never allow me to be other than</p>
<p>Yours truly and gratefully | S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> George Mivart</p>
