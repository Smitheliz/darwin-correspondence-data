<p>I am much obliged for your note.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have read your work, but the subject is so abstruse, &amp; as my health is weak, I am not sure that I have mastered your views.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I can however see that your work exhibits much talent. It has delighted me to find that you are not shocked at the belief that man is a modified and wonderfully improved descendant of some lower animal-form.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> This belief, considering the date of the publication &amp; that your country is France, is a surprising &amp; very gratifying fact. Throughout Europe, with the exception of France, the great principle of evolution seems to me to be now fixed on a sure basis; though very many yet demur to man being included in the same category.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I still fear that we differ much in our views on the origin of the moral sense, but I shall be pleased to find that I am mistaken.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Pray believe me dear Sir. | Yours very faithfully | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The recipient is conjectured from the content of the letter. The year is established by the address. CD stayed at 9 Devonshire Street from 16 February until 21 March 1872 (see ‘Journal’ (Appendix II)).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">No letter from Roujou has been found. His paper on analogies between the human type and that of very ancient mammals (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6750.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Roujou 1872</ref>) was presented at a meeting of the Société d’anthropologie on 18 January 1872 (the date is given in the running head of the paper). CD’s annotated copy of the article is in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL. An inscription on the front reads, ‘A Monsieur Darwin | hommage de profond respect et d’admiration pour ses travaux’ (To Mr Darwin, a token of profound respect and admiration for his works).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Arguing from morphological comparison of humans and more ancient mammals, Roujou suggested that the first lemurs appeared well before the secondary period and the first monkeys before the tertiary, and that early humans appeared at the beginning of the tertiary period (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6750.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Roujou 1872</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Roujou argued that the only logical explanation of human origins was the transformist one, and further that all vertebrates developed from a single original type (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6750.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Roujou 1872</ref>, pp. 50–2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD had recently failed to be elected to the zoological section of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_15.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Académie des sciences</ref> for the second time (see letter from Armand de Quatrefrages, 12 January 1872 and n. 2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Roujou had argued that the calculated self-interest of individuals produced a kind of morality among certain animals, but he had not further elaborated his views on the origin of the moral sense (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6750.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Roujou 1872</ref>, p. 121). In contrast, CD held that moral sense was not acquired by each individual but was innate and arose from social instincts, and further, that any social animal would inevitably acquire a moral sense if its intelligence were as developed as that of humans (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 1: 71).</note>
