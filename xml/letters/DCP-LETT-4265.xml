                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>Your kind note of 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> May has duly come to hand as also the Journal of Researches &amp; the Paper on Linum for which I beg to tender my best thanks.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Although my time has been of late much taken up with matters of business, I have at last sight of the researches you recommended me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The experiment on Ficus is in progress &amp; I shall report later on it.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> With Melastomas I am not much more advanced but your supposition that insects visit them for nectar also is apparently correct.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The pollen-seekers are however by far the earliest risers &amp; I think the act of fecundation is performed by them. All Melastomaceae I am acquainted with, or which I have noticed lately, are abundantly visited by insects, so much so that in the forest you often “hear” them in flower before you see them. I am unable to detect any dimorphism, but in the genus Spennera &amp; Nepsera one can distinguish varieties, as in many Species of the arborescent Melastomaceae.</p>
<p>I have found lately a new instance of a plant which to all appearance cannot fertilize itself &amp; which is abundantly provided with a substance attracting insects. This is Narantea, a remarkable Marcgraviacea, &amp; very beautiful creeper, native of our woods. As we cultivate it here in the Garden I have it constantly under observation while it flowers.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The whole anthers, which separate from the filament, with the included pollen, or perhaps the pollen alone form a viscid extremely sticking mass, soluble with difficulty in water. The stigma reaches maturity only after the anthers. But the pitchers into which the Bracteae of this flower are converted contain a large quantity of syrup, clear as crystal, often 5–6 drops. This is only secreted when the flowers open, the Bracteae are empty up to that moment. Insects are very fond of this syrup &amp; as the opening of the generally pendulous bract is towards the flower, they naturally alight on the latter &amp; proceed from there to drink the syrup. Marcgravia has powdery pollen, &amp; only a few pitchers to a whole umbel of flowers, the pitchers however contain nectar.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am curious to examine Ruyschia, but that is a rare plant here. It will perhaps be useless to look amongst these strongly characterized plants for immediate striking varieties, but a Nature which creates itself difficulties in order to overcome them as it were for sport, has been for me always a very sterile idea. The clue that your theory gives to these phenomena is much more satisfactory.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Have you directed your attention to the genus Mentha? I am afraid that the Mints generally are not easy to make experiments with, but I believe that Salvia also shows sometimes dimorphism.— With regard to sports in cultivated plants here I cannot agree with Schomburgk.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> By neglect dahlias &amp; such degenerate, ie double &amp; fine flowers are no more produced, but otherwise I can see nothing particular. That plants vary here perhaps more than in temperate zones appears to be correct &amp; in this respect I wish to draw your attention to the genus Capsicum. The innumerable varieties of the species, varieties which in their turn become at once true from seed, are something very astonishing. I should think it could be proved there, if one had the time, how quick a variety takes all the characters of a species.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> As generations of plants succeed each other much quicker here, the process of transmutation must go on, caeteris paribus,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> much more rapidly. If I had more time &amp; means at my command I should very much like to experimentalize in these matters but it is impossible under present circumstances to do anything.—</p>
<p>Another subject to which I shall draw your attention, (although it may not be necessary) is that of the periods in which certain cultivated plants begin to vary. It is not my original idea, and is I believe to be found in older writers,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> but I believe I should have been struck with it. You know that for instance the old Caladium bicolor has been cultivated in Europe for nearly a Century now. Yet all the varieties, as far as I can see, are of the last ten or 20 years. Some of them are supposed to be species, but where is the proof.</p>
<p>The most wonderful part of it is however, that here, where the plant has been cultivated for ornament &amp; for superstitious purposes,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; where it has become wild, the varieties have made their appearance also, &amp; some of the prettiest are to be found in uncultivated spots, where certainly seeds of the introduced ones have not reached. Of course I do not allude to the new Colocasias, &amp; such, but only to the Caladiums. I believe that many more cases will be found in this matter, &amp; not always to be explained by the increased attention people have paid to plants at certain periods.—.</p>
<p>The Catasetums which I am cultivating, begin to show flower stalks now, &amp; in a month or so, I shall study the matter anew.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Of late I have often observed our larger Orchids Such as Stanhopeas, Gongoras, Coryanthes, &amp; in all of them insects are certainly very busy, but in some the nectar-seeking ones are certainly not those which occasion fecundation. This is particularly the case, as far as my observation goes with Gongora &amp; Coryanthes.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> But then it must be admitted that the insect world of cultivated grounds like this garden is in many respects different from that of the high woods where these orchids prosper.</p>
<p>Besides there are whole tribes of nocturnal insects, which escape our observation, particularly those of the forests. We have here for instance a tribe of nocturnal or vespertini Wasps, which I believe visit flowers like many of their relations. It is extremely likely that many of these visit the stigmas of Orchids, for the sweet fluid found there. I think it is not sufficiently known or kept in mind, that the tissues which compose the stigma of many Orchids, are affected at the critical period in a manner analogous to that in ripening fruits, ie. that part of the cellulose &amp; starch is used up to form sugar, by which process the cells cease at the same time to cohere, &amp; form a sort of pulp, which is very attractive to insects. It is well known that pollen tubes are emitted best artificially in syrup.—</p>
<p>Excuse the length of this letter, I shall report soon on the Catasetum etc, &amp; send you specimens in spirit.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>Very sincerely yours | H Crüger.</p>

CD was seeking information on the question of whether introduced plants from different climates were particularly apt to produce bud-variations (see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3880.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to G. H. K. Thwaites, 29 December [1862]</ref>).

            <note xml:id="foot.f9">CD omitted the genus <hi rend="italic">Capsicum</hi> from his discussion of variation in cultivated plants because botanists were ‘not agreed which kinds ought to rank as species and which as varieties’, and the wild parent-species were unknown (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 371).</note>
