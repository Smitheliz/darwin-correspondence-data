            <p>Asks for authentic information on following questions: 1. Has the weight of the gooseberry variety London subsequently exceeded the 1845 record of 880 grains?</p>
            <p>2. Is any record kept of the diameter of the largest pansies?</p> 
<p>3. How early does any variety of <hi rend="italic">Dahlia</hi> flower and do some varieties withstand frost better than others?</p>

<p>As you have been so obliging as to insert my query on the crossing of Strawberries,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> perhaps you will grant me the favour to insert two or three other questions, for the chance of some one having the kindness to answer them. I am writing a book on “Variation under Domestication,” in which I treat chiefly on animals; but I wish to give some few facts on the changes of cultivated plants.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>1st. The fruit of the wild Gooseberry is said to weigh about 5 dwts. (I am surprised that it is so heavy), and from various records I find that towards the close of the last century the fruit had doubled in weight; in 1817, a weight of 26 dwts. 17 grs. was obtained; in 1825, 31 dwts. 13 grs.; in 1841, “Wonderful” weighed 32 dwts. 16 grs.; in 1845, “London” reached the astonishing weight of 36 dwts. 16 grs., or 880 grains. I find in the “Gooseberry Register” for 1862,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> that this famous kind attained only the weight of 29 dwts. 8 grs., and was beaten by “Antagonist.” Will any one have the kindness to inform me whether it is authentically known that the weight of 36 dwts. 16 grs., has, since the year 1845, been ever excelled?</p>
<p>2nd. Is any record kept of the diameter attained by the largest Pansies? I have read of one above 2 inches in diameter, which is a surprising size compared with the flowers of the wild Viola tricolor, and the allied species or varieties.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>3rd. How early does any variety of the Dahlia flower? Mr.  Salisbury, writing in 1808, shortly after the first introduction of this plant into England, speaks of their flowering from September, or the end of September, to November.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Whereas, Mr. J. Wells, in Loudon’s “Gardener’s Magazine” for 1828, states that some of his dwarf kinds began flowering in June.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I presume the end of June. Do any of the varieties now regularly flower as early as June? Have any varieties been observed to withstand frost better than other varieties?<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>If any one will give me information on these small points, I shall feel greatly obliged.— Chas. Darwin, Down, Bromley. Kent.</p>
