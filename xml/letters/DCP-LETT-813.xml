<p>I ought to have written to you, ere this, in answer to your last note; but was unwilling to do so, until I should have subjected the specimens to another careful investigation, under a higher power. This I have been prevented from doing until last night; and the result is such, as to make me wish to make a further examination of the Pampas tufa, before expressing a decided opinion respecting it.— As to its non-identity with the Chilian tufa, I am equally clear as before; but I have detected in it some additional traces of distinct organic forms, which do not correspond with anything I have elsewhere seen. My impression is, that they are remains of Spongeous bodies. As you have been good enough to allow me to “work my wicked will” with the specimens, I shall make a thorough examination of them, and I hope to be able to arrive at some definite conclusions.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I can quite relieve your scruples about the expense of preparing the sections, by telling you that they are made by a boy who acts as a servant in my small establishment, and the share of whose time devoted to these objects is amply covered by the grant of the Association;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> under the purposes of which I consider that the examination of your specimens most legitimately comes. I am hoping to induce the Government to take up the subject in connection with the Geological department of the Ordnance Survey; and shall be very glad of your good word, if you have an opportunity of speaking it.</p>
<p>I am, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sir | yours very truly | W B Carpenter</p>
