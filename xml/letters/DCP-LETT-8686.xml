<p>In reading your new book, an idea with regard to the erection of its feathers by a bird, &amp; of its hair by a beast, has occurred to me, which I have thought I might dare to communicate to you.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Please p〈a〉rdon me if m〈y〉 suggest〈ion〉 is <hi rend="italic">[1 or 2 words illeg]</hi> It seems to me that this habit must be of real use for defence. Surely a hen with its feathers ruffled, (and its head drawn back to its body) is to a great extent defended against the attack of a dog.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Similarly the bristling mane of a lion is a great protection against the teeth of an other animal. His enemy would hardly know ‘where to have him’, &amp; would perhaps get merely a mouthful of hair ins〈tea〉d of a grip of the lion’s throat. Even in the case of the monkey &amp; snake, the snake would have greater difficulty in fixing its fangs if the hair of the monkey were erected.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> This defence-theory seems to me so obvious, to have so strong a primâ facie probability on its side that I cannot but think that you have rejected it with very good reason for the expression-theory.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I therefore beg again that you pardon me for troubling you with this letter.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD acknowledged that the erection of the dermal appendages such as hair or feathers did made an animal ‘appear larger and more frightful to its enemies or rivals’, but he doubted that the power of raising them was ‘primarily acquired for this special purpose’ (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2400.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Expression</hi></ref>, p. 95). He argued that it was a reflex action produced by fear, which, through force of habit, could become a voluntary action for defensive purposes (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., pp. 101–2).</note>
