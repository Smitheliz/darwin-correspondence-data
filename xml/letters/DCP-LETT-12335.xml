        <abstract> 
<p>Thanks CD for noticing some difficulties in his hypothesis. Concedes that there is no proof that higher plants are more intolerant of carbon dioxide than lower plants. Argues that the main difference between the lowlands and the high mountains in Palaeozoic times would be the much greater climatic fluctuations that would occur on the mountains. Discusses carbon dioxide diffusion in the Palaeozoic atmosphere. Thinks that the large number of species and genera peculiar to high mountains favours the assumption that "their diffusion must date from a geologically remote period" [see <hi rend="italic">ML</hi> 2: 20–2].</p>

                <div type="transcription">
                     
                    <p>Your very kind note of 13 August last—reached me only very lately when I returned for a few days to England—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I need not say that I read it with the greatest interest. I feel as strongly as possible that the hypothesis that I have ventured to put forward requires very much fuller development than I have yet been able to give it before it can claim even that degree of assent which belongs to a conclusion towards which several separate lines of probability appear to converge. I need not say that I have no notion of endeavouring to lure you into controversy but as you have been good enough to notice some specific difficulties I will venture to make a few observations on them<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>1. Absence of experimental proof that the higher plants are more intolerant of carbonic acid gas than the lower—</p>
<p>I believe that all the experiments hitherto made on the cultivation of plants in an atmosphere surcharged with CO<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> have been inconclusive owing to the practical difficulty of maintaining a nearly uniform composition in the imprisoned air whose CO<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> is rapidly decomposed by the growing plants—but even if it should be shown that there is no such difference as has been supposed in the effect of excessive CO<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> on the growth of the higher &amp; lower plants I should not regard that as very important to my argument. It seems to me probable that the great &amp; important difference between the condition of the lowlands &amp; the high mountains in palæozoic (pre-coalmeasure) times was not so much the chemical difference between the effect of the less charged air of the upper region &amp; that of the more charged air of the lower zone as the <hi rend="underline">physical</hi> difference in the effect on vegetation of rapid &amp; considerable changes of temperature &amp; seasons of activity &amp; repose, which would be felt in the more freely radiating upper region as compared with the lower zone where difference between night &amp; day w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be almost insensible &amp; that of the seasons comparatively slight.</p>
<p>2. In considering the question of the probable degree of diffusion of CO<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>—in an atmosphere containing 20 times the present proportion—(25 times would be I think nearer the mark) it would be well to consider that the only important interference with the law which w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> regulate an atmosphere at rest—(whose condition I had calculated) arises from the action of winds— But the diminished radiation from the greater part of the surface of the planet when surrounded by an atmosphere surcharged with CO<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> &amp; aqueous vapour, would cut off or nearly so at their source most of the aerial currents &amp; very much lessen the cause of disturbance.</p>
<p>3 Of course under almost any reasonable view of the origin of the existing flora one would expect a certain amount of relation between the floras of the mountain masses &amp; that of the surrounding lower regions— I will not presume to give an opinion whether on the whole the facts favour the idea of the mountain plants being derived from the low country or vice versa— I should have thought that both were true to some extent— But apart from this I should think that the number of genera &amp; species peculiar to the high mountains is great enough to make an a priori probability in favor of the opinion that their diffusion must date from a geologically remote period   I stop myself lest I should contrary to my intention let this degenerate into an argument—instead of merely thanking you for your remarks   If I am able to carry on the work that I have in my head I shall hope to obtain more countenance for my ideas than I can now expect from you</p>
<p>believe me most sincerely yours | John Ball</p>
