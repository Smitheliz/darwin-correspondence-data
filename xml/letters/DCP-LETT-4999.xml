<p>I am very much obliged for your note &amp; the extract which have interested me extremely.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I cannot disbelieve for a moment Agassiz on Glacial action after all his experience, as you say, &amp; after that capital book with plates which he early published;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> as for his inferences &amp; reasoning on the valley of the Amazon that is quite another question; nor can he have seen all the regions to which M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> A. alludes.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Her letter is not very clear to me &amp; I do not understand what she means by “to a height of more than 3000 ft”.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> There are no erratic boulders (to which I particularly attended) in the low country round Rio. It is possible or even probable that this area may have subsided; for I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> detect no evidence of elevation or any tertiary formations or volcanic action.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>The Organ M<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi>. are from 6000 to 7000 ft in height &amp; I am only a little surprized at their bearing the marks of glacial action.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> For some temperate genera of plants viz Vaccineum, Andromeda, Gaultheria, Hypericum, Drosera, Habenaria, inhabit these M<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi>. &amp; I look at this almost as good evidence of a cold period as Glacial action.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> That there are not more temperate plants can be accounted for by the isolated position of these Mountains.</p>
<p>There are no erratic boulders on the Pacific coast North of Chiloe &amp; but few glaciers in the Cordillera; but it by no means follows I think that there may not have been formerly gigantic glaciers on the Eastern &amp; <hi rend="underline">more humid</hi> side.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>In the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi> Ed. of the Origin p 403, you will find a brief allusion, on authority of Mr D. Forbes, on the former much lower extension of glaciers in the equatorial Cordillera.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Pray also look at p 407 at what I say on the nature of Tropical vegetation (which I could now much improve) during the glacial period.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I feel a strong conviction that soon every one will believe that the whole world was cooler during the glacial period.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Remember Hooker’s wonderful case recently discovered of the identity of so many temperate plants on the summit of Fernando Po &amp; on the M<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi>. of Abyssynia:<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I look at as certain that these plants crossed the whole of Africa from E. to W. during this same period. I wish I had published a long chapter written in full &amp; almost ready for the press on this subject which I wrote ten years ago.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> It was impossible in the Origin to give a fair abstract.<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>My health is considerably improved, so that I am able to work nearly 2 hours a day &amp; so make some little progress with my everlasting book on domestic varieties.<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>You will have heard of my sister Catherine’s easy death last Friday morning.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> She suffered much, &amp; we all look at her death as a blessing for there was much fear of prolonged &amp; greater suffering. We are uneasy about Susan, but she has hitherto borne it better than we c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have hoped.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>Emma joins me in love to Lady Lyell<ref target="#foot.f19"/> &amp; believe me dear Lyell | yours affectionately | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>Remember glacial action of Lebanon, when you speak of no glacial action in S. &amp; on Himalaya &amp; in S.E. Australia.—<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>P.S. I have been very glad to see Sir C. Bunbury’s letter.<ref target="#foot.f21"/> If the genera which I name from Gardner are not considered by him, as usually temperate forms, I am of course silenced;<ref target="#foot.f22"/> but Hooker looked over the M.S chapter some ten years ago &amp; did not score out my remarks on them,<ref target="#foot.f23"/> &amp; he is generally ready enough to pitch into my ignorance, &amp; snub me as I often deserve.— My wonder was how any, even so few, temperate forms reached the mountains of Brazil; &amp; I supposed they travelled by the rather high land &amp; ranges (name forgotten) which stretch from the Cordillera towards Brazil— Cordillera genera of Plants have, also, somehow reached the Silla of Caraccas.<ref target="#foot.f24"/></p>
<p>When I think of the vegetation of N. Zealand &amp; W. coast of S. America, where glaciers now descend to, or very near, to the sea, I feel it rash to conclude that <hi rend="doubleUnderline">all</hi> Tropical forms w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be destroyed by a considerably cooler period under the Equator.—<ref target="#foot.f25"/></p>
