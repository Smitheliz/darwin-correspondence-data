                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I was uncommonly glad to get your letter of May 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. &amp; it was extremely good in M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Gray to write to me so nice a note.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Very many thanks to her &amp; to you for the answers about Expression. I well know how extremely difficult it is to observe. One of her answers about the “grief muscles” in a <hi rend="underline">negro</hi> is of especial value, as I have failed on this head with all the more distinct races of man, &amp; began even to doubt whether it could be general.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The case of the shrugging the shoulders will also be useful, &amp; that about the head not being shaken laterally for negation, is very disagreeable &amp; surprising.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Very many thanks for all your kind expressions about my accident: my horse fell &amp; partly rolled over me. Paget thought I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> require three months to recover, but I was nearly well in 3 weeks.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have, however, had more pain lately &amp; not been very brisk. My good &amp; dear wife, in consequence, is going to take me, nolens volens, on the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to a house, which we have hired in N. Wales for 6 or 7 weeks.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>We all heartily wish you could have given a better account of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Gray’s strength. It is very disheartening that the voyage sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have driven away so much of the good effects of your grand trip up the Nile.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I have little to say about my own doings. My regular work has been much interrupted by preparing a new Edit. of the everlasting old Origin, which consumed 8 weeks, &amp; by preparing notes for a French Edit. of my Orchis book. In these notes I give references to all papers on subject, with very brief abstracts; so that I have had to quote you incessantly. I think I shall also publish these notes in English.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> By the way I tried to get Orange Judd &amp; Co to publish the new Edit. of the Origin; but the Appletons were too strong for me. They say courtesy prevents them: fear of their pockets, I presume, is nearer the truth. What an evil this stereotyping scientific works is.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I ought to tell you that they sent me <hi rend="superscript">£</hi>50 for the “Variation under Domestication”, which I think very handsome &amp; which I owe to you.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I have not heard from Hooker, but I see in Gard. Chronicle, that when elected as President for next Congress, he was received with <hi rend="underline">great</hi> applause.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> We have seen hardly a soul for a long time except the Huxleys, &amp; two detachments of Nortons.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I then verified a grand generalisation, which I once propounded to you, that all persons from the U. States are perfectly charming.</p>
<p>Farewell, my dear Gray, I often think with pleasure of your visit here.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> Give from all of us our kindest remembrances to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Gray &amp; believe me | Ever yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | You know how many odd points I want observed: look whether the beards of Germans, when differing in tint from Hair of head, are of a lighter or redder tint? Does Beard &amp; Hair often differ in tint?<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
