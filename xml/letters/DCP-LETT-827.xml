<p>I am very glad to be able to tell you that my Father is at present very well; he has, however, till lately been suffering a good deal from a cough.— When do you intend to pay your Shrewsbury visit? Thanks for your letter &amp; all your news of your Noah’s Ark;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> really be a curiosity to see the place, besides other pleasures. Emma would have as much pleasure I think, as myself, in accepting your very cordial invitation, but I fear there is a reason against it, which even you will admit to be paramount, viz her confinement in the middle of July<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; as soon as the Baby can travel viz Sept 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> we must visit Maer<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; Shrewsbury.— It really is one of my heaviest grievances from my stomach, the incapability &amp; dread I have of going anywhere: I literally have not slept, I believe, out of inns, my own, Erasmus’ Shrewsbury &amp; Maer houses, since I married.— My stomach continues daily badly, but I think I am decidedly better than one or two years ago, as I am able with rare exceptions to do my three hour’s morning work, which at present is on the Geology of S. America, &amp; very dull it will be.—</p>
<p>You ask about Down, the house is now very comfortable; &amp; the garden will be tolerably so, when the evergreens are grown up; I continue to like it very well; &amp; its thorough rurality is invaluable.— By the way, do not ask about the Vesta stove (&amp; thanks for your remembering it) for after hearing it from other quarters, also, highly praised, I <hi rend="underline">saw lastly</hi> an Arnotts stove in action, &amp; that struck the balance, &amp; I have got one, &amp; it answers admirably, requiring feeding only twice in 24 hours, &amp; once will do.—</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear you are coming to London, &amp; do, if you possibly can, come on here; we shall be heartily &amp; cordially glad to see you, &amp; you now know, how quietly &amp; in the eyes of most, dully we go on.—</p>
<p>I have not heard anything lately about Mesmerism; except Sidney Smiths dream, (who is said to be dying)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> that he dreamt he was in a madhouse &amp; that he was confined in the same cell with Miss Martineau &amp; the Bishop of Exeter.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It is said that the remarks on Miss. M. in the Athenæum, were by Brodie;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I thought them much superior to the general writing in that paper.— I hear Miss. M. is in so excited a state about Mesmerism, that she can hardly keep on peace with her old friends, who are unbelievers; I wonder how she &amp; Erasmus will get on.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I simply feel, that I <hi rend="underline">cannot</hi> believe, in the same spirit, as it is said, that ladies do believe on all &amp; every subject.</p>
<p>I read aloud Arnolds Life<ref target="#foot.f9"/> to Emma &amp; liked it very much; I wish he had had rather a more lightsome &amp; humorous spirit: as Carlyle would say, he was no “sham”.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Farewell my dear Fox. | I hope we shall soon meet here. Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like very much sometime a few of my potatoes,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> &amp; chiefly to get true seed from them, &amp; see whether they will sport or not readily.—</p>
