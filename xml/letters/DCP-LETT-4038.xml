                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I thank you for your very interesting &amp; kind, I may say charming letter.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I feared you might be huffed for a little time with me; I know some men would have been so.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have hardly any more criticisms, anyhow worth writing. But I may mention that I felt a little surprise that old B. de Perthes was not rather more honourably mentioned.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I would suggest whether you could not leave out some references to the “Principles”;<ref target="#foot.f4"/> one for the real Student is as good as a hundred; &amp; it is rather irritating &amp; gives feeling of incompleteness to general reader to be often referred to other book.— As you say that you have gone as far as you believe on species-question,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have not a word to say; but I must feel convinced that <hi rend="doubleUnderline">at times</hi>, judging from conversation, expression, letters &amp;c, you have as completely given up belief in immutability of specific forms, as I have done.— I must still think a clear expression from you, <hi rend="underline">if you could have given it</hi>, would have been potent with the public, &amp; all the more so, as you formerly held opposite opinion.—</p>
<p>The more I work the more satisfied I become with variation &amp; n. selection; but that part of the case I look at as less important, though more interesting to me personally. As you ask for criticisms on this head (&amp; believe me, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not have made them unasked) I may specify (p. 412, 413) that such words as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> D “labours to show”—“is believed by the author to throw light”, would lead a common reader to think that you yourself do <hi rend="underline">not</hi> at all agree, but merely think it fair to give my opinion.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Lastly, you refer repeatedly to my view as a modification of Lamarcks doctrine of development &amp; progression;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> if this is your deliberate opinion there is nothing to be said—; but it does not seem so to me; Plato, Buffon, my grandfather before Lamarck &amp; others propounded the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">obvious</hi> view that if species were not created separately, they must have descended from other species:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> &amp; I can see nothing else in common between the Origin &amp; Lamarck. I believe this way of putting the case is very injurious to its acceptance; as it implies necessary progression &amp; closely connects Wallace’s &amp; my views with what I consider, after two deliberate readings, as a wretched book; &amp; one from which (I well remember my surprise) I gained nothing.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> But I know you rank it higher, which is curious, as it did not in the least shake your belief.— But enough &amp; more than enough. Please remember you have brought it all down on yourself!!—</p>
<p>March 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>— I must add that Henrietta,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> who is a first rate critic &amp; to whom I had <hi rend="underline">not said a word</hi> about Lamarck, last night said, “Is it fair that Sir C. Lyell always calls your theory a modification of Lamarcks? Why is it more a modification of his, than of any one’s else?” Do not allude to this, for I do not suppose she would at all approve of my quoting her appropriate (in my opinion) criticism.— I have more trust in your judgment than in my own, so I hope you may be right, as far as mere policy is concerned, in your very gentle statement of your belief.—</p>
<p>Many thanks about Aye-Aye paper; I have written to Sir Henry.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear about Falconer’s “reclamation”;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I hate the very word, &amp; have a sincere affection for him.— I have been much interested in Athenæum controversy:<ref target="#foot.f13"/> how well M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Flower puts in the way in which Owen has falsely dragged in size of brain.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Your answer seemed to me very good; except I regretted your too great civility in saying that Owen must have <hi rend="underline">forgotten</hi> what he said in Annals; it was a brazen lie, &amp; ought not, I think, to have been treated so delicately.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
<p>Did you ever read anything so wretched as the Athenæum Reviews of you, &amp; of Huxley especially Your <hi rend="underline">object</hi> to make man old, &amp; Huxley’s <hi rend="underline">object</hi> to degrade him. The wretched writer has not a glimpse what the discovery of scientific truth means.—<ref target="#foot.f16"/> How splendid some pages are in Huxley; but I fear the book will not be popular.</p>
<p>I have just reread your letter; it seems that I mentioned the sentence “Should it ever become highly probable”: I remember determining not to mention it; but it seems that I was overtaken.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>Ever my dear Lyell | Yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I keep very queer in health, &amp; we have resolved, eheu eheu, to start for Malvern after Easter holidays.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD refers to Lyell’s reaction to the criticisms of C. Lyell 1863a that CD made in his letter of 6 March [1863]. In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4035.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">letter to CD of 11 March 1863</ref>, Lyell stated: ‘Pray write any criticism that occurs to you; you cannot put them too strongly or plainly.’ CD’s annotated copy of C. Lyell 1863a is in the Darwin Library–CUL (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi></ref> 1: 525–7).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In the 1840s, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_558.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Jacques Boucher de Perthes</ref> discovered shaped flints in Pleistocene deposits in the Somme valley, which, he argued in the first volume of <hi rend="italic">Antiquités celtiques et antédiluviennes</hi> (Boucher de Perthes 1847–64), were human artefacts contemporaneous with the associated Pleistocene fossils. His explanation was initially widely rejected, but his findings were confirmed following visits to the location in 1858 and 1859 by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1585.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hugh Falconer</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3854.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Prestwich</ref>. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3103.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Grayson 1983</ref>. Boucher de Perthes’s research and collections are mentioned several times in C. Lyell 1863a; however, CD apparently considered that he was not given due credit for his priority in determining the prehistoric nature of the Somme artefacts.</note>

CD also refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4935.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alfred Russel Wallace</ref>, with whom he announced the theory of natural selection in 1858 (C. Darwin and Wallace 1858).

Lyell appears to have replied to this request in a missing portion of his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4035.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">letter to CD of 11 March 1863</ref>. CD himself bought a copy of the number, which is now in the Darwin Library–CUL. The reference may be to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2337.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Henry Holland</ref>, although no such letter has been found.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f17">CD refers to C. Lyell 1863a, p. 469, which states: <quote type="quote"> we ought by no means to undervalue the importance of the step which will have been made, should it ever become highly probable that the past changes of the organic world have been brought about by the subordinate agency of such causes as ‘Variation’ and ‘Natural Selection.’ </quote> This passage is not mentioned in the extant text of the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4028.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 6 March [1863]</ref>, although CD did criticise an earlier passage on the same page (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4028.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 6 March [1863]</ref> and n. 40); it may have been one of the passages criticised in a letter from <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref> to Lyell (see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4040.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from J. D. Hooker, [15 March 1863]</ref> and n. 6). Lyell did not refer to the passage in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4035.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">letter to CD of 11 March 1863</ref>, but it was probably discussed in a postscript to the latter that has not been found (see also n. 11, above). In the second edition (C. Lyell 1863b, p. 469), the phrase ‘should it ever become highly probable’ was altered to read ‘should it hereafter become the generally received opinion of men of science (as I fully expect it will)’.</note>
