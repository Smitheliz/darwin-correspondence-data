<p>I have read again “Truths for the Times”, &amp; abide by my words as strictly true. If you still think fit to publish them, you had better perhaps omit “I believe” &amp; add “almost” to every word—so that it will run .... ....“&amp; I agree to almost every word.”<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The points on which I doubtfully differ are unimportant but it is better to be accurate. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be much obliged if you would somehow preface the words as an extract from a letter not originally intended for publication, or to this effect; as it seems to be somewhat conceited or arrogant otherwise to express my assent.—</p>
<p>I can say with entire truth that I feel honoured by your request that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. become a contributor to the Index, &amp; am much obliged for the draft.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I fully, also, subscribe to the proposition that it is the duty of everyone to spread what he believes to be the truth; &amp; I honour you for doing so with so much devotion &amp; zeal. But I cannot comply with your request for the following reasons; &amp; excuse me for giving them in some detail, as I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very sorry to appear in your eyes ungracious. My health is very weak: I <hi rend="underline">never</hi> pass 24 hours without many hours of discomfort, when I can do nothing whatever. I have thus also lost two whole consecutive months this summer. Owing to this weakness, &amp; my head being often giddy I am unable to master new subjects, requiring much thought, &amp; can deal only with old materials. At no time am I quick thinker or writer; whatever I have done in science has solely been by long pondering, patience &amp; industry.— Now I have never systematically thought much on Religion, in relation to Science, or on morals in relation to society, &amp; without steadily keeping my mind on such subjects for a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">long</hi> period, I am really incapable of writing anything worth sending to the Index. Many years ago I was strongly advised by a friend never to introduce anything about religion—in my works, if I wished to advance science in England; &amp; this led me not to consider the mutual bearings of the two subjects. Had I foreseen, how much more liberal the world would become, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. perhaps have acted differently.— As I honestly feel I could not be an efficient contributor to the Index, I am sure that you will excuse my returning your draft.</p>
<p>Forgive this untidy note, for my head has been giddy for much of the day, | With entire respect &amp; good wishes, believe me, My dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>I see I have not thanked you for the extreme kindness of your letter, received this morning.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
