        <abstract>
            <p>Responds to CP’s sermon. Corrects CP’s confusion of what CD said about eyes of the Articulata with human eye,</p>
            <p>and questions applicability of CP’s mathematical arguments about length of geological time needed for evolution.</p> 
<p>Agrees he was foolish about the Wealden, now struck from later editions [<hi rend="italic">Origin</hi>, pp. 285–7].</p>

<p>I have read with much interest your sermon, with its appendices, &amp; I thank you sincerely for having sent it me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I should be a very cross-grained man to object to a single word that you have said. You pay me the most elegant compliments, and attack me with much spirit and force. Even if I could you would not thank me for making a long defence; but I may make two remarks. When I refer to the extremely simple eyes of the <hi rend="underline">articulata</hi> (<hi rend="underline">i.e.,</hi> insects, spiders, etc.), you translate this into the human eye.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Should there be a second edition, I hope you will correct this, for I have always spoken of the human eye as the pinnacle of difficulty.</p>
<p>You speak of the necessity of various parts of the eye changing simultaneously in order that it may become adapted for even slightly changed work; but many a short-sighted person can see an object distinctly at a distance which renders the image confused to others.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>What a very curious case about the increasing length of day!<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have that profound respect for mathematics which profound ignorance gives, but I cannot help observing that when applied to uncertain subjects, such as geology, it gives as uncertain results as geologists arrive at by other means; for instance, how Thomson and others differ about the thickness of the crust of the earth and the rate of cooling.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>My son George has been much interested by your sermon, and begs to be very kindly remembered to you.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>With my best thanks, pray believe me, yours very sincerely, | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>That is a very foolish episode of mine about the Wealden, and was struck out in later editions.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

Pritchard assumed CD meant an eye ‘as perfect as the human eye’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6437.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Pritchard 1866</ref>, p. 32). CD had expanded his discussion of the possible development of the eye in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6017.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> 4th ed.</ref>, pp. 216–18.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD refers to another argument Pritchard made against Darwinian theory, based on astronomical evidence that the length of a day was constantly increasing (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5239.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, 12 October [1866]</ref> and n. 8).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">The physicist William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) had recently calculated the age of the earth based on its cooling from a molten ball.
