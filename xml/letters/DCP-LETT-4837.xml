<p>I have taken a long time to thank you for the Catalogue, the introduction to which I read with much interest.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The cause has been that I have had a very bad month; but I know begin to hope that through the aid of an acquaintance of yours (D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Chapman) my health will receive some considerable improvement from the application of ice to the spine.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I write now to ask a favour of you, a very great favour from one so hard worked as you are. It is to read 30 pages of M.S, excellently copied out, &amp; give me not lengthened criticism, but your opinion whether I may venture to publish it.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> You may keep the M.S. for a month or two. I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not ask this favour, but I <hi rend="underline">really</hi> know no one else whose judgment on the subject w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be final with me.</p>
<p>The case stands thus; in my next book<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I shall publish long chapters on bud—&amp; seminal—variation, on inheritance, reversion, effects of use &amp; disuse &amp;c. I have also for many years speculated on the different forms of reproduction.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Hence it has come to be a passion with me to try to connect all such facts by some sort of hypothesis. The M.S which I wish to send you gives such a hypothesis; it is a very rash &amp; crude hypothesis yet it has been a considerable relief to my mind, &amp; I can hang on it a good many groups of facts.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I well know that a mere hypothesis, &amp; this is nothing more, is of little value; but it is very useful to me as serving as a kind of summary for certain chapters. Now I earnestly wish for your verdict given briefly as “Burn it”—or, which is the most favorable verdict that I can hope for, “It does rudely connect together certain facts &amp; I do not think it will immediately pass out of my mind”   If you can say this much &amp; you do not think it absolutely ridiculous I shall publish it in my concluding Chapter.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Now will you grant me this favour? You must refuse if you are too much over worked—</p>
<p>I must say for myself that I am a hero to expose my hypothesis to the fiery ordeal of your criticism</p>
<p>Believe me my dear Huxley | yours most sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Huxley sent CD a copy of T. H. Huxley and Etheridge 1865, <hi rend="italic">A catalogue of the collection of fossils in the Museum of Practical Geology, with an explanatory introduction</hi>, at the beginning of May (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4824.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from T. H. Huxley, 1 May 1865</ref>). CD had read the proof-sheets of the preface in 1857 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 6, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2185.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to T. H. Huxley, 16 December [1857]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2194.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 25 December [1857]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">According to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242), <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_885.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Chapman</ref> visited CD on 20 May 1865. See also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4834.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Chapman, 16 May [1865]</ref>, and Appendix IV. Chapman was proprietor and editor of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>, to which Huxley had been a regular contributor (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8277.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Wellesley index</hi></ref>; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1979.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">A. Desmond 1994–7</ref>, 1: 185).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The copy that CD sent to Huxley has not been found; however, the manuscript from which the copy was made is in DAR 51: C36–74. For a transcript of the original manuscript, which was titled ‘Hypothesis of Pangenesis’, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5954.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Olby 1963</ref>. This first statement of pangenesis differed in several respects from the version that was later published in chapter 27 of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref>; see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5955.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Olby 1985</ref>, pp. 84–6.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD refers to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref>, which was published in 1868.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD’s notebooks and manuscripts indicate that he developed his ideas about heredity and reproduction over a thirty-year period (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4424.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Kohn 1980</ref>, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3703.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hodge 1985</ref>, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5955.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Olby 1985</ref>). For an earlier indication that CD was attempting to develop a hypothesis connecting information on reproduction, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 6, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2166.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to T. H. Huxley, [before 12 November 1857]</ref>. For a discussion of nineteenth-century debates on heredity and their bearing on the theory of transmutation by natural selection, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2760.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gayon 1998</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The hypothesis of pangenesis that CD outlined to Huxley suggested that each individual cell throws off minute particles (gemmules) that circulate in the bodily fluids and are capable of generating new cells, or remaining dormant until required. The gemmules are drawn together by mutual attraction and into the right places in the right order to, for instance, reconstruct (in organisms that have that capability) a tail or other limb where one has been torn off. Cells throw off gemmules at all stages of development and all gemmules circulate until required: thus embryo gemmules thrown off by embryo cells come together, when conditions are right, to form what CD called the germ (the female element) or the male element; the germ, if fertilised (or even if not, in the case of parthenogenesis), grows into a new embryo (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5954.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Olby 1963</ref>). Gemmules could also remain dormant for several generations before being sparked into activity. Thus CD thought pangenesis could explain both sexual and asexual reproduction, as well as reversion and the regrowth of body parts. For a discussion of the development of the hypothesis of pangenesis during the 1860s and the part played by CD’s contemporaries, including <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4495.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Herbert Spencer</ref>, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3492.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Victor Naudin</ref>, and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3629.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Richard Owen</ref>, in shaping it, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2779.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Geison 1969</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">The manuscript discussed here was expanded and revised before being published in the penultimate chapter of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref>, ‘Provisional hypothesis of pangenesis’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 2: 357–404).</note>
