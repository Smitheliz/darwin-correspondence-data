<p>As Charles is recovering from a lingering attack he has desired me to answer your very kind note. We really are going to set out “bag &amp; baggage” to Malvern as soon as he is well enough. It is a great trouble taking all the household, but we think he could not give Dr Gully’s treatment a fair trial under 6 weeks or 2 months &amp; that would be too long to leave the children even with their Aunts. We both feel very hopeful that it will be of some use to Charles tho we do not venture to hope a cure. This has been a disheartening winter with respect to his health.</p>
<p>Dr Gully writes like a sensible man &amp; does not speak very confidently.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Susan &amp; Catherine are now with us &amp; both pretty well &amp; I am glad to see that Susan’s spirits are good enough to make her feel an interest in all that goes on. I mention her particularly as she was more constantly with her father &amp; therefore would feel the blank more.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Catherine is going abroad for some weeks with a sister &amp; an Aunt of mine in the course of the spring.</p>
<p>One of the things we shall most enjoy if it pleases Heaven to give Charles the blessing of better health would be to see more of you &amp; Mrs Fox &amp; that all our children should become intimate. I have no doubt I have not thanked you half enough for your thorough interest in this step of ours</p>
<p>Mrs Fox &amp; I should feel very jealous &amp; spiteful at each others babies just now for I think they are about the same age.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Ours <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a remarkably nice one I must say.</p>
<p>with our kindest remembrances to Mrs F. E. D.</p>
