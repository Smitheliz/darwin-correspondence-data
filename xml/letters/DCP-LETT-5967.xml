        <abstract>
            <p>Thanks HTS for his valuable information. Hopes to arrive at probable answer to question of proportion of males to females in the progeny of butterflies bred in domestication.</p>
            <p>On courtship of butterflies, CD believes something more than chance is involved in determining which male is successful.</p>

<p>Your letter has been wonderfully interesting to me, &amp; what immense trouble you have taken in writing so many letters, the answers to which I have been very glad to see.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The subject is extremely complex, &amp; to me very important. I am having domesticated animals tabulated, &amp; by patient enquiry, I hope to arrive at some degree of probability; certainty I fear is out of the question.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> With man alone we know positively that males are born in excess. D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wallace thinks that with B. Cynthia he certainly breeds more males than females.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>He seems to think that in collecting caterpillars any one w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be more likely to collect those which w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> turn into females than those which w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> turn into males, from the former being some what larger &amp; thus more likely to be chosen, or unconsciously to strike the eye.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> This certainly seems not improbable; &amp; if you are not wearied out, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to have your opinion on this head; for it is a most uncomfortable anomaly that more free males sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be captured &amp; more females bred under confinement.</p>
<p>I am sorry that my last note about the protective colouring of the brimstone &amp; Orange-tip butterflies did not reach you in time; but my query, as far as the appearance of the Brimstone is concerned is incidentally answered by Mr Doubleday.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I think I shall write to him about the courtship of butterflies.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> In the case of moths D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wallace seems positive that there is no courtship, &amp; that the female receives the first male which comes.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> If I am not mistaken I have seen several male Butterflies pursuing one female, &amp; I cannot but think that something more than mere chance must decide which shall be successful. So with the crowding Lasiocampas—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>In truth I do not know how to thank you enough; &amp; I will not give any more trouble.</p>
<p>Believe me Yours sincerely obliged | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>I think I will write to Quatrefages about silk-moths in France.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
