<p>Encloses note from William Buckland [<hi rend="doubleUnderline">1190</hi>], stating that no appointment of surveyor is to be made. Thinks further recommendation would be unwise, but will write to Sir Henry De la Beche and [Robert?] Hutton if EC wishes.</p>

<p>I enclose the Dean’s note to me;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> you will see that he does not believe that there is going to be any appointment. I do not know whether he mentioned this to you in conversation,—you do not refer to it in your note received this morning. I know M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hutton<ref target="#foot.f3"/> and Sir Henry<ref target="#foot.f4"/> and could write to them, if you wish it and if you are sure that there is going to be appointed an Assist. Surveyorship. Neither M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hutton, nor Sir Henry (certainly not the former) are likely to bring forward themselves anyone for the place, and I am doubtful whether the strong letter, which I have already written would not have its effects weakened by similar applications to other Members of the Board.— I think I have noticed that when a recommender shows too keen an interest in a candidate, his evidence is thought less of, as biassed by personal feelings. Think this over and ask your father’s opinion—if you still wish me to write to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hutton and Sir Henry, I will with <hi rend="underline">pleasure</hi> do it; I should not, however, in that case write at such length. I hope the Dean’s notion of there being no place will turn out a mistake.</p>

<p>I do not think I shall have any Cirripedial drawings made till next summer.</p>
