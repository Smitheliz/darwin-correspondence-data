<p>I herewith send you the four little packets of Lice.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I remember thinking that one, though minute, was an odd form.—</p>
<p>I sincerely wish I could aid you in obtaining fresh materials: should I have any opportunity, I will not fail to remember to ask anyone, whom I may meet &amp; think likely to have specimens: but I live so retired in the country, that I now see few naturalists. Have you ever applied to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. A. Smith, (Fort Pitt Chatham) the S. African Traveller, if you like to write to him, you can use my name &amp; say, I was sure that he would be glad to assist every naturalist.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am sorry to say I shall not be at York,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> otherwise you might depend on my aid, feeble though it would be.</p>
<p>With my best wishes for success in your laborious pursuit.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Pray believe me | dear Sir | yours very faithfully | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S I have kept no copy of the extract of ‘White’s Regular Gradation in Man’—a foolish book with some odd facts—published, I think, at Manchester. You w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> easily find the passage to which I refer.— I <hi rend="underline">think</hi> it was in the latter part of the volume.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>The next time I write to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hooker I will ask him, whether he has Lice of Penguins.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I find I can make the bottle safe, so will send it by Post at same time with this note.— The bottle sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be opened, as it is not quite full— the spirits are quite strong enough</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is established by CD’s offer in this letter to write to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref> and ask whether he had specimens of penguin lice, and by the fact that CD responded to Denny’s queries about the specimens sent with this letter in his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-770.xml" resp="#automat" cert="medium">letter to Denny of 12 August [1844]</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 3). In 1844, the last Saturday before 12 August was 10 August, the latest possible date for this letter. CD wrote to Hooker mentioning Denny’s request for penguin lice in a letter originally published in <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 3 with the date [25 July – 29 August 1844]. The nearest extant letter from CD to Hooker before this one is dated 22 July [1844] (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 3), and does not mention Denny or penguin lice. In 1844, the first Saturday after 22 July was 27 July, the earliest possible date for this letter. The letter to Hooker mentioning Denny’s request for penguin lice, which was written on a Thursday, should therefore be dated [1–29 August 1844], 1 August being the first Thursday after 27 July.</note>
