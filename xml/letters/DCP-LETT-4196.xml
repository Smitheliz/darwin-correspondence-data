<p>I was very glad to receive your Review of Decandolle a week ago.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It seems to me excellent &amp; you speak out, I think, more plainly in favour of derivation of species, than hitherto, though doubtfully about natural selection.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Grant the first, I am easy about the second. Do you not consider such cases as all the Orchids next thing to a demonstration against Heer’s view of species arising suddenly by monstrosities:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> it is impossible to imagine so many coadaptations being formed all by a chance blow. Of course Creationists would cut the enigma.</p>
<p>What an indomitable worker you are! Why these Reviews, supposing I were to attempt them, would take me a month’s work.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have written twice to you not very long ago,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; sent 2 copies of my Linum paper;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> but they &amp; letter were sent about time of sailing of Anglo-Saxon, &amp; were perhaps lost.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I only remember in my letter telling you how right you were about fertilisation of Cypripedium.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Of the species sent by you, C. acaule alone has flowered &amp; has puzzled me. Mitchella, alas, does not look very healthy with all our care.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> If you see &amp; know M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Scudder please thank him particularly for his interesting paper on Pogonia, which I was very glad to read.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>To return to your Review: I was very glad to see your Remarks in answer to Falconer on Phyllotaxy;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I infer you cannot explain why there are not intermediate angles. I have been looking at Nageli’s work on this subject,<ref target="#foot.f13"/> &amp; am astonished to see that angle is not always the same in young shoot when leaf-buds are first distinguishable as in full-grown branch. This shows, I think, that there must be some potent cause for those angles which do occur: I daresay there is some explanation as simple as that for the angles of the Bees-cells.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>You allude to Saporta’s work;<ref target="#foot.f15"/> Alp De Candolle sent me a copy of part of letter from him, in which he expressed strong belief that N. Selection would ultimately be triumphant in France, though now quite ignored.—<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p>
<p>I have nothing to tell you about my own doings: I work every day, that I can, on my big book &amp; am now at all causes of sterility under domestication &amp; cultivation.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> I have got such an immense collection of facts, that the work though laborious &amp; slow interests me, as I can generally come to some sort of conclusion. There never will be a man who will read my big book; it will be a sort of encyclopedia on special cases.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
<p>I have been looking again at the imperfect flowers of Oxalis &amp; Viola: I was entirely wrong in supposing that in Oxalis the perfect flowers required insect-aid for fertilisation; so this view is knocked on the head. Viola, however, does require insects.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> I must yet stick to my opinion that the imperfect flowers of Viola at least deserve to be ranked as something more than mere precocious flowers. In V. canina only 2 anthers are developed; the pollen-grains are smaller—the pistil widely different in shape; no nectar-appendages to the two fertile stamens &amp; no spur.—<ref target="#foot.f20"/> Remember, if you can get them, seed of Campanula perfoliata.—<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>I suppose you are very busy, &amp; I suppose the whirlwind of public affairs must waste much of your time. Do not think of writing to me unless you have any leisure; though a letter from you is always a real pleasure to me. I suppose there are few human beings in England who see so few persons out of their own family as I do.—</p>
<p>Good night. | Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I have been observing common Broom: hardly any orchid shows prettier adaptation to insects which are necessary for its fertilisation:— The <hi rend="underline">upper</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">lower</hi> surface of thorax of Bees gets dusted with pollen, &amp; first the stigma rubs the upper side of thorax &amp; afterwards is rubbed by the lower side of thorax.—<ref target="#foot.f22"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The year is established by the reference to Gray’s review of A. de Candolle 1862a (see n. 2, below), published in May 1863.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Gray’s review of A. de Candolle 1862a appeared in the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Science and Arts</hi> (A. Gray 1863d). There are annotated copies of A. de Candolle 1862a and A. Gray 1863d in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In his review, Gray argued that the views adopted by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_813.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Alphonse de Candolle</ref> were representative of a general consensus among eminent naturalists, that is, that species had come into existence coincident in time and space with pre-existing and closely allied species, and that the distribution and origin of congeneric species had come to be ‘regarded as something derivative’ (A. Gray 1863d, pp. 437–8). On natural selection, Gray stated his opinion that: ‘something more than natural selection is requisite to account for the orderly production and succession of species’ (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 440).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">In his review of A. de Candolle 1862a, Gray noted that Candolle supported the concept of the ‘derivation of species’, but had been unclear as to whether he viewed that process as one of slow and very gradual change, following CD’s view of the origin of species, or whether he believed, with the Swiss palaeobotanist <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2199.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Oswald Heer</ref>, that sudden, inexplicable change, and the production of monstrosities, were causal factors in the production of new species (A. Gray 1863d, p. 438). Heer’s views on the origin of new species were developed within the context of his studies of Tertiary floras (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3482.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Heer 1855–9</ref>).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f19">In the letter to the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Horticulture and Cottage Gardener</hi>, [17–24 March 1863], CD had written: <quote type="quote"> But it is known that several plants, such as Violets, Campanulas, Oxalis, &amp;c., produce two kinds of flowers: one sort adapted for self-fertilisation, and the other sort for fertilisation by insect agency or other means. </quote> CD made further observations on <hi rend="italic">Oxalis acetosella</hi> between 31 March and May 1863 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4084.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to John Scott, 12 April [1863]</ref>, and experimental notes in DAR 111: 46 and DAR 109: B6). CD initially believed the ‘perfect flowers’ of the species to be heterostyled and hence adapted to cross-pollination by insects, but later concluded that the species was homostyled (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, p. 182). CD’s observations on <hi rend="italic">Viola</hi> were published in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, pp. 315–21 and 336. CD had been experimenting on ‘imperfect’ (cleistogamic) flowers of <hi rend="italic">Oxalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Viola</hi> since 1862; he summarised his provisional conclusions on their function in the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3830.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 26[–7] November [1862]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 10). There is a series of experimental notes on ‘imperfect’ flowers of <hi rend="italic">Viola</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oxalis</hi>, dated between 15 April 1863 and 15 May 1863, in DAR 111: 8–11, 46.</note>

CD used the case of ‘imperfect’ (cleistogamic) flowers in <hi rend="italic">Viola</hi> as an example of how elements of flower structure, superfluous to the pollination mechanism, could gradually disappear (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, p. 336).</note>
