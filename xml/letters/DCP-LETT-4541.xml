<p>I have just got home from Edinburgh; where I have secured through your favour a sufficiency of articles for an outfit.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I expect to have these forwarded in the latter end of the week, when I will send you a list with cost. I would have liked if this had been less, but a friend who had been in India,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> and to whom I freely stated my circumstances and desire to limit expenditure, assured me that I was ordering nothing but real necessaries.</p>
<p>I also made several enquiries as to cost of the 2 routes; but I could not get full particulars in Edinburgh as to Cape route further than that the expenses of the latter are so much less, as not to permit of further enquiry as to the other or— overland.</p>
<p>I wrote two of the Shipping Cos. in London—whose vessels run between Southampton &amp; Calcutta for information as to costs of voyage. I am daily expecting an answer which I will immediately forward to you. I am glad to find that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker has so kindly thought of getting an agent to look out for a ship for me, when he gets particulars.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have now the pleasure of acknowledging the honour you have done me in drawing up for me such a very excellent testimonial.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I beg to assure you that I will make it my endeavour more &amp; more to merit such.</p>
<p>I am greatly surprised with the self-fertility of your Peloric Antirrhinums. I wrought much on my 2 plants, but utterly failed in getting them to yield a single seed, by own-pollen. When fairly settled in India, I will take advantage of all the opportunities presented for working out the subject of the fertility of monstrous flowers: and should you not have occasion to notice previously your own results &amp; mine on Antirrhinums I will be glad to incorporate both.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have just received proofs of a portion of my paper on Primulas.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>With sincere thanks for your unremitting kindness. I have the honour to remain. | Sir. | Your obed<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Servant | John Scott</p>
<p>P.S. I will send you copies of my tables of <hi rend="underline">Verbascum</hi> experiments, I place them entirely at your service.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
