<p>I thank you cordially for your most kind letter, with its high commendation of my book on Expression.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am must own that it has pleased me greatly, as you have already carefully attended to the subject, and as you possess so profound a knowledge of physiology. Your letter has pleased me all the more, as I feel that I am growing old, and I was not at all sure that the work was worth publishing. When I sent you the copy, I was not in the least aware that you had studied the subject; and I sent it simply because I thought that our minds were of a kindred nature, and that whatever interested me, would probably interest you. I have received the pamphlets which you have been so good as to send me,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> and I will soon get my wife to translate them to me.</p>
<p>I accept with gratitude the high honour which you propose to confer upon me by your dedication.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> With respect to the translation of my book, if the possibility had ever occurred to me that you would have been willing to undertake it, I would assuredly have refused every other proposal; but as it is, two Gentlemen have applied to me, and I am pledged to one of them.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>With my best thanks and highest esteem, | Pray believe me, | My dear Sir, | Yours faithfully and obliged, | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. Since the above was written I have received your very kind gift of your Physiology of Pleasure.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
