            <p>In the series of opium poppy intercrosses made at CD’s suggestion, JS has learned that the reason they failed to intercross was the absence of insects at the period of their flowering.</p>

<p>I had hoped to get down to Calcutta ere this and get some papers, which I have there, looked over, for my notes on Lagerstrœmia (as I have none here) but I am detained and will be, I find for a week or two longer.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have heard from Dr. King, but only to the effect that he can make nothing whatever of the specimens in the herbarium.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I was surprised at this but he has lately sent me a few of the specimens of <hi rend="underline">L. indica</hi> and <hi rend="underline">elegans</hi>, all truly worthless as I find for your purpose.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Not a single flower has an entire pistil or stamen, indeed scarcely a trace of them: the work doubtless of the herbarium boys, who are employed <hi rend="underline">brushing</hi> mouldy specimens during the rainy season.</p>
<p>In so far as I recollect the species I particularly referred to was <hi rend="underline">L. elegans Wall</hi>. I have never observed it produce a single seed in our gardens or in those of Calcutta, though it is very generally grown as an ornamental shrub. Moreover, it is everywhere associated with <hi rend="underline">L. indica</hi>, of which I believe it is now regarded as a variety.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> <hi rend="underline">L. indica</hi> the normal var. with red flowers is fairly fertile in the Calcutta gardens if I recollect aright, but in gardens here I have rarely seen a single seed vessel on it, and that never containing more than <hi rend="underline">two</hi> good seeds.</p>
<p>I find only one form in the gardens here (Bankipore), I enclose flowers; I am sorry I could not get more of them.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Lafoensia Vandelliana</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Duabanga</hi> <hi rend="underline">Sonneratiaoides</hi>, are peculiarly variable from season to season in their fertility.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have notes somewhere on them, but I cannot lay my hands on them. I have no doubt however the variability is due to the flowers being visited or neglected by insects. The frequency of flower-visiting insects in our fields and gardens <hi rend="underline">varies much</hi> from season to season. I think much more so than in temperate climates.</p>
<p>I have this season been struck with the <hi rend="underline">numbers</hi> of <hi rend="underline">two small bees</hi> which have haunted the flowers of a Litchi (<hi rend="underline">Nephelium Litchi</hi>) in my garden here. The result of this is that a very large of <hi rend="underline">fruits</hi> <hi rend="underline">are twin</hi>: this I assure you is most exceptional, indeed I never in the Calcutta gardens observed it. of the normally 2-celled ovary <hi rend="underline">one</hi> only attains maturity. Different specimens bear varying proportions of <hi rend="underline">male</hi> and hermaphrodite flowers.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I made as I wrote you before a series of intercrosses &amp;c as you suggested with our vars. of the opium poppy.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> However, I have now learned, that the real secret of the varieties not intercrossing is wholly due to the absence of insects at the period of their flowering; <hi rend="underline">i.e</hi> the months of December, January &amp; February. I have just had a provoking illustration of this. Last season, I had seeds of Turkey, Spanish, Italian and French opium poppy, sent me. I had five crops of each, but they did not come into flower until well on in March, and thus afforded a very late crop. Being much occupied with other work I did not observe that insects were haunting the flowers, but I was much astonished to find that the <hi rend="underline">vars.</hi> were hopelessly intercrossed: a red-flowered French <hi rend="underline">var</hi>. being the prepotent as evidenced by the preponderance of flowers approaching it in form and colour. I have thus attended particularly to them during the flowering period, and I find various species of <hi rend="underline">Bees</hi> greedily feeding on their pollen. This is so much the case that in looking over the flowers an hour or so after the first expansion in the morning, you can scarcely find a trace of pollen. Indeed they scarcely leave a trace of it on the stigma, and I am sure that this season anyhow, the plants can be but very sparingly fertile. I shall not fail to let you know the results when I gather the crop. As I told you before, I never observed insects affecting our local <hi rend="underline">vars</hi>. of poppy which flower early. It is indeed very remarkable that, the winds (often very strong during their flowering period to not effect general intercrossing of the <hi rend="underline">vars</hi>. This no doubt the explanation of the apparent permanency of the vars. remarked on by M. Jourdan.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I have just finished, and having finally copied a rather lengthy paper on Sap Circulation, in which I have shown it I think satisfactorily to be mainly due to <hi rend="underline">barometric pressure</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I have also giving I think good and sufficient reason for the rejection of the theory of a descending, elaborated sap. In it I have given illustrations of those vessels in the poppy on which the peculiar rythmical motion of the milk-sap depends.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4"><hi rend="italic">Lagerstroemia elegans</hi> Wall. is a synonym of <hi rend="italic">L. indica</hi>, and considered to be a variety of the latter with paler flowers.</note>

In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10721F.xml" resp="#automat" cert="medium">letter to Scott of 15 December 1876</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 24), CD had asked for flowers of each form in order to measure the size of the pollen-grains. CD described the extreme variability in the length of the stamens and the uniformity in size of the pollen-grains of <hi rend="italic">Lagerstroemia indica</hi>, and cited Scott’s observations, in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2613.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Forms of flowers</hi></ref>, pp. 167–8.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f7"><hi rend="italic">Nephelium litchi</hi> is a synonym of <hi rend="italic">Litchi chinensis</hi> (lychee).

Lychees produce functionally female flowers with fully developed pistils and non-dehiscent anthers, and two types of functionally male flowers, some with rudimentary pistils and others with developed but non-functional pistils (Sedgley and Griffin 1989, p. 66). Scott probably mistook some flowers for hermaphrodite.</note>
