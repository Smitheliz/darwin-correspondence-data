<p>There is a French Whaler lying here which sails to day for M. Video, &amp; I take this opportunity of writing to you.— I am very anxious that the Megatherium head, which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Keen procured for me,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> should not be lost. You will be, I am sure, be glad to hear, that the fossil relics of older days, which I found at B. Blanca, have been of preeminent interest to those few, who in England care about such things.— Prof: Henslow &amp;c begs of me to collect every scrap of the bones of the head of the great monster; for this reason, the specimens which M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Keen intended to forward from the R. Negro are the more valuable.— I dare say you have already sent them to the Admiral at Rio.— You will very much oblige me, by sending a line to Valparaiso to state time &amp; Ship, by which they were conveyed there so that, if they fail to arrive, I can write to Sir Michael Seymour.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Since the Beagle left the Plata, we have had a pleasant cruize; we spent some time on the coast of Patagonia; the country swarms with Gaunaco several were killed, but besides these, there were few living creatures. For my own part, I found some interesting work for the Geological hammer.— I trust, with what I saw to the North, to be able to draw up a tolerable sketch of the geology of this Eastern side of S. America. We then entered the Straits &amp; passed on to Famine &amp; returned to survey the east coast of Tierra del F.— The entrance of the Straits are found to be much narrower than drawn in the charts.— After the coast was finished we ran down to near Cape Horn, &amp; returned &amp; beat up the Beagle Channel to J. Button’s country. Poor Jemmy was quite naked, excepting a rag round his waist; he was however very happy, did not wish to return to England; had not forgotten his English &amp; lastly, but not least, he had married a young; &amp; for a Fuegian, a beautiful Squaw.— From thence, we scudded to this island; this seat of discord for the elements, as well as for Human affairs.— You will have heard of the murder of poor Brisbane &amp;c &amp;c; such scenes of fierce revenge, cold-blooded treachery, &amp; villainy in every form, have been here transacted, as few can equal it.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I shall be curious to hear what the wise Gov〈er〉nment of B. Ayres says on the occasion I suppose “a just revolt,” “their poor subjects groaning under the tyranny of England” &amp;c &amp;c. When you write you must tell me all the gossip. How goes on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Griffith &amp; your new minister?—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> How fare the Indians against the Cæsar-like Rosas!?— You must not forget to write to me under charge of British Consul, Valparaiso Remember me most kindly to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Lumb, &amp; with my best thanks for all your kindness | Believe me Yours very truly | Charles Darwin</p>
<p>We shall soon Sail to the river of Santa Cruz: it must be from the account of the Indians an immense one: I will keep my eyes open for Nutrias.— I suppose what I wrote about the Chupat quite knocked on the head your scheme.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Do not forget to give my best remembrances to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Keen. I shall not soon forget what very pleasant days I spent at their Estancia.—</p>
