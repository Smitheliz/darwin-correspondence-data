                    <p>R was very late coming in so that we had rather a hurried consultation over the letter &amp; I did not thank you for caring to consult us—which I do most heartily whatever you do with our advice— You will see by my first letter which was written before I got yours how sure I felt that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not think of answering Butler.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I foresee one result of your letter that Butler will say you have been guilty of another quibble— first you say to him that it never occurred to you to state that Krause had altered his article &amp; then that you actually had it in the proof sheets &amp; as you say accidentally omitted to publish it— Now, Butler, will say which of these two statements are true—&amp; so it gives him scope for a whole set of fresh insults—&amp; with his clever pen he can make something very disagreeable, out of this— The world will only know or at any rate remember that you &amp; Butler had a controversy in which he will have the last word— If they understand it at all they’ll see that its nothing whatever against you—but if they merely know there have been letters backwards &amp; forwards they may think there is some ground for Butlers accusation agst you of jealousy of yr grandfather—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>If you leave the letter alone the facts are all there for those who care to read them, &amp; it remains that Butler said some nasty spiteful things which you didn’t care to answer</p>
                    <p>So Goodbye dear Father— You get enough advice from us in quantity—</p>

<p>Henrietta asks me to write my ideas on the Butler letter &amp; your proposed answer.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>When I read Butler’s statement at the Club<ref target="#foot.f5"/> yest<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> I was much relieved to find that it was of a kind which, as I thought made <hi rend="underline">any answer</hi> absolutely unnecessary. Neither in form, nor in substance, is it such as to suggest that a reply is expected. You will observe that it does not, as is common with newspaper attacks, ask for any further information or explanation, or touch any point of fact on which either the assailant, or a reader, could require such— In short, I never was clearer about anything than that, if it were my case, I should say nothing.</p>
<p>I tried, a second time, to read the Statement, as if I were an outsider who knew nothing of the quarrel, &amp; felt entirely sure this is the right conclusion.</p>
<p>Not one reader in a thousand will make head or tail of the grievance. It’s all muddled up with complaints agst divers reviewers—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> This alone practically neutralizes any effect it might have had otherwise. Then if an attentive reader <hi rend="underline">does</hi> care to look back &amp; see what the complaint was he will also see (though in a brief form) your substantial reply: and this is on the face of it, sufficient for the purpose. All the rest of B.’s insinuations read to an outsider as merely the annoyance &amp; venom of a man out of temper &amp; hitting wildly about him.</p>
<p>If you answer him you bring about <hi rend="underline">exactly</hi> the result he most wants, w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi> is to fill people’s heads with the notion that y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. b<hi rend="superscript">k</hi>. is in some way a reply or rejoinder to his: in fact you make it a “Darwin–Butler affaire” as the French w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. say—and this is what will delight him.</p>
<p>As it stands there is nothing w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. any friend of y<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. or any absolutely indifferent person c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> want explained or answered, and the <hi rend="underline">tone</hi> of Butler is of itself quite enough to deprive him of any shadow of <hi rend="underline">claim</hi> to an answer w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. a loyal and friendly correspondent might have.</p>
<p>What I am trying to convey in this letter is that I have thought the thing over as a <hi rend="underline">cold outsider</hi>. &amp; that it is in this character that I am against any reply to B.</p>
<p>I agree however wholly with all that H. says as to y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. draft reply.</p>

                    <p>But in any case omit interpolated sentence about you   Could give explanation of how omission came to be made<ref target="#foot.f8"/>   People will easily guess that such an accident is possible &amp; this weakens the effect— Also &amp; this is much more important omit last sentence which shows that Butler has stung you—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> of course there is no question of a controversy between you &amp; the letter shd be done with a perfectly dry cold manner. I shd like you to treat Butler like a man does a woman who hits him— it isn’t pleasant, but its impossible to meet it—</p>
                    <p>Your character for perfect fairness &amp; magnanimity is known to everybody who knows anything of science &amp; to think that anybody will heed what Butler says is absurd— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be very sorry that this last sentence sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> go forth—</p>
