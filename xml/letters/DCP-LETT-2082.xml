<p>I have thought that perhaps in course of summer you would have an opportunity &amp; would be so very kind as to try a <hi rend="underline">little</hi> experiment for me.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I think I can tell best what I want, by telling what I have done. The wide distribution of same species of F. Water Molluscs has long been a great perplexity to me: I have just lately hatched a lot &amp; it occurred to me that when first born they might perhaps have not acquired phytophagous habits, &amp; might perhaps like nibbling at a Ducks-foot.— Whether this is so I do not know, &amp; indeed do not believe it is so, but I found when there were many <hi rend="underline">very</hi> young Molluscs in a <hi rend="underline">small</hi> vessel with aquatic plants, amongst which I placed a dried Ducks foot, that the little barely visible shells <hi rend="doubleUnderline">often</hi> crawled over it, &amp; that they <hi rend="underline">adhered</hi> so firmly that they c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not be shaken off, &amp; that the foot being kept out of water in a damp atmosphere, the little Molluscs survived well 10, 12 &amp; 15 hours &amp; a <hi rend="underline">few</hi> even 24 hours.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> And thus, I believe, it must be that Fr. W. shells get from pond to pond &amp; even to islands out at sea. A Heron fishing for instance, &amp; then startled might well on a rainy day carry a young mollusc for a long distance.—</p>
<p>Now you will remember that E. Forbes argues chiefly from the difficulty of imagining how <hi rend="underline">littoral</hi> sea-molluscs could cross tracts of open ocean, that islands, such as Madeira must have been joined by continuous land to Europe:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> which seems to me, for many reasons, very rash reasoning.— Now what I want to beg of you, is, that you would try an analogous experiment with some sea-molluscs, especially any strictly littoral species,—hatching them in numbers in a smallish vessel &amp; seeing whether, either <hi rend="underline">in larval</hi> or <hi rend="underline">young shell state</hi> they can <hi rend="underline">adhere</hi> to a birds foot &amp; survive say 10 hours in <hi rend="underline">damp</hi> atmosphere out of water. It may seem a trifling experiment, but seeing what enormous conclusions poor Forbes drew from his belief that he knew all means of distribution of sea-animals, it seems to me worth trying.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>My health has lately been very indifferent, &amp; I have come here for a fortnight’s water-cure.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I owe to using your name a most kind &amp; most valuable correspondent, in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hill of Spanish-Town.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I hope you will forgive my troubling you on the above point &amp; believe me, | My dear Sir | Your’s very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | Can you tell me, you who have so watched all sea-creatures, whether male Crustaceans ever fight for the females: is the female sex in the sea, like on the land, “teterrima belli causa”?<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>I beg you not to answer this letter, without you can &amp; will be so kind as to tell about Crustacean Battles, if such there be.—</p>
