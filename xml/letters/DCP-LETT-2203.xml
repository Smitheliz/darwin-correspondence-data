<p>My note on papilionaceous flowers crossed yours on the road; &amp; for it I am much obliged for it told me a good deal of news. Though that about Henslow I am truly grieved to hear; I had thought his heart had got quite right again.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I saw the death of Miss Jenyns in the paper.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I enclose some queries for D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. <ref target="#foot.f4"/> but I suppose he will think them too troublesome &amp; trifling to be attended to.</p>
<p>I do not see that the musk ox, of which remains have been found in Siberia, is any great difficulty for I have never for one second doubted the possibility, nay probability of such slight changes as the union of the shallow Behring’s Straits.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Your Indian Mysore &amp; Carnatic plants in tropical Australia seems to me a more curious case.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I am very doubtful whether I shall be up for Club;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> owing to Boys holidays drawing to a close, &amp; sickness in our house. My wife often ails, &amp; Lenny has very frequent bad days with badly intermittent pulse.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> We escaped a considerable anxiety in George having apparently a regular low fever, but it died away &amp; has spoiled only a fortnight of his holidays.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Oh health, health, you are my daily &amp; nightly bug-bear &amp; stop all enjoyment in life. Etty keeps very weak.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> But I really beg pardon, it is very foolish &amp; weak to howl this way. Everyone has got his heavy burthen in this world.—</p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to come up; if it were only just to see you &amp; Lyell, who must be brimming full of geological news.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>Farewell | My dear Hooker | Yours affec<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> | C. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | I have just got your letter for which thanks. The Clover case was published in the “New Zealand Journal” date not given but republished in Gardeners Chronicle Dec. 16. 1843.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Humble-bees, I believe, are mundane in their distribution; but I do not know how it is in small islands. Bees are more confined in their visits to particular flowers, than you seem to be aware.— I daresay the Clover case may break down, &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not have thought about it, had not so many facts, all vague, all pointed in same direction.</p>
<p>I cannot come up so soon as Tuesday, for we have relations in House:<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I doubt much whether I shall be up for Thursday</p>
<p>Farewell</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD apparently forgot to add the name or initial when he started a new page of his letter.

Sinclair had been a naval surgeon before entering the colonial service.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD refers to the hypothesis that land-bridges existed between continents in former geological periods. He had long felt that naturalists should not invoke land-bridges to explain the geographical distribution of plants and animals without first considering the different ways that organisms might have been transported over the intervening sea. However, as he states in this letter, he did not doubt that in a few cases, such as the Behring Straits, land-bridges might previously have existed. Hooker, on the other hand, believed that sea transportation between land masses was too infrequent and accidental to be the main means of dispersal (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3764.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hooker 1853–5</ref>, 1: xx–xxvii). CD and Hooker had discussed the point at length (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 6, especially letters to J. D.
