<p>His admiration for the papers of AG [see <hi rend="doubleUnderline">8119</hi>].</p> 
            <p>Relates his recent discovery that earthworms have brought to surface no less than 161 tons of dry earth over an area of 10 acres, thus creating the conditions for significant denudation. Would welcome information about the persistence of ridges and furrows in old pasture lands ploughed centuries ago. Do they run down the slopes or transversely? Refers to [A. C.] Ramsay, [James] Croll, Elie de Beaumont, and [Henry] Johnson.</p>

<p>I am truly obliged for your paper which I have read with greatest possible interest.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You put whole case with admirable clearness. I did not know whether you will care to hear what I am about. I formerly observed the action of earth-worms, &amp; lately I have ascertained the amount which they <hi rend="underline">annually</hi> bring to surface &amp; (for even figures) it is over area of 10 acres no less than 161 tons of <hi rend="underline">dry</hi> earth in the finest condition for being washed away.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> This is generally perched on the blades of grass, &amp; if long or heavy rain falls soon, it flows (as I have ascertained) a little down even a gentle slope. I can not enter here into full details.— Now some 30 years ago, when I blundered so finely over Glen Roy, I remember thinking that slopes covered with turf could not be degraded, even during thousands of years.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> This I now see is a complete error. The roots of plants which secrete so much carbonic acid, &amp; the humic acid, are known to disintegrate some rocks,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; then earth-worms bring the finer particles to the surface, &amp; they will be washed a <hi rend="underline">little</hi> downwards; again buried in the roots, &amp; again brought up, &amp; again washed a little down.— As I have been in <hi rend="doubleUnderline">old</hi> days a great sinner about sub-aerial denudation, it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. please me much to throw even smallest ray of light on subject.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I lately thought of one great difficulty, &amp; you refer to it; viz the persistence of ridges &amp; furrows on old pasture lands, ploughed centuries ago.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I remember some 40 years ago having seen such with surprise in N. Wales.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Have you ever observed any such cases? I want very much to know whether the ridges &amp; furrows run down the slopes, or transversely. If up &amp; down the slopes, all that I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. expect would be that they would be less well defined at the lower than at the upper parts of the sloping surface. Of course you will not think of answering this note, unless you can kindly give me any information about old grass-covered ploughed land.—</p>
<p>I have forgotten to thank you for your volcanic paper. which I read with interest in our Journal.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Excepting your personal friends, I believe no one was more sorry to hear of the fever which spoiled your Italian tour, than I was, as I felt sure that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have done excellent work—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>Pray believe me | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>Will you excuse me for saying how much I admire the manner in which you give fair praise to Ramsay, Croll (whose paper I formerly read) &amp; Whitaker.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> How can Elie de Beaumont pretend to say that old tumuli &amp; fortifications are now as steep &amp; lofty as they once were?—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I am trying to get observations made by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> H. Johnson at Wroxeter, viz how much fine earth is now heaped over narrow walls.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>Forgive me for scribbling at such length.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">In 1861, CD had concluded that one of his earliest geological papers, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6177.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Parallel roads of Glen Roy’</ref>, was ‘one long gigantic blunder’, and that his theory to account for the geological phenomena described in it was completely erroneous (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 9, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3247.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to T. F. Jamieson, 6 September [1861]</ref>). In this paper, CD had written (p. 76): <quote type="quote"> if we look at a convex slope of soil clothed with turf, and drained on each side by rivulets, we can see no reason, as long as the vegetation is persistent, why such a slope (with the exception of any spot where a waterspout might burst, or a stroke of lightning fall) should not last for as many thousand centuries as the obelisks of Egypt shall remain entire. </quote> He used the argument that turf-covered ground would suffer little erosion to support the case that the upper roads might have been formed much earlier than the lower roads without suffering substantially greater denudation.</note>
