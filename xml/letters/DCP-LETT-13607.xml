        <abstract>
            <p>Thinks that "women though generally superior to men [in] moral qualities are inferior intellectually". Believes that men and women may have been aboriginally equal in this respect but that to regain equality women would have to "become as regular ""bread-winners"" as are men". Suspects the education of children and "the happiness of our homes" would greatly suffer in that case.</p>

But to do this, as I believe, women must become as regular “bread-winners” as are men;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; we may suspect that the early education of our children, not to mention the happiness of our homes, would in this case greatly suffer.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">On the comparative mental and moral powers of women and men, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1966.xml"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi></ref> 2: 316–29.  By ‘laws of inheritance’, CD means his theory that certain traits emerge only on maturity in a particular sex and are often transmitted only, or in a higher degree, to offspring of the same sex, and that males and females mature at different rates. He argued that among ancestral humans and savages, males had evolved superior strength, courage, and energy, as well as higher powers of reason, invention, and imagination, as a result of their battle with other males during maturity for the possession of females; and that in civilised societies, these powers were reinforced by continued rivalry between men, and their role as providers for the family. The moral superiority of women, he argued, was rooted in maternal instincts. CD’s views in <hi rend="italic">Descent</hi> had been cited by a writer who believed in the intellectual inferiority of women (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 29, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-13579.xml">letter from C. A. Kennard, 26 December 1881</ref> and nn. 1 and 2). </note>
