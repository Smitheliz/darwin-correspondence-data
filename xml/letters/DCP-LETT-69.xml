<p>I take this opportunity of writing a few lines to you. It was by a mistake of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Shaw that the beasts &amp; birds were not sent to you before this time.— I hope you will approve of their stuffing &amp; that they will arrive safe &amp; sound. The one with the smaller tail is from Ireland, &amp; the other from Wales. Which is the Pine &amp; which is the common Marten appears to me hard to ascertain.—</p>
<p>I returned from Maer on Saturday evening, &amp; was most exceedingly grieved to hear from Catherine that there is no hope of seeing you &amp; your family this summer at Shrewsbury I want very much to hear from you as I do not quite understand your plans. You are going into Yorkshire, sometime in the end of August, &amp; I want to know how soon you will return? for I am very sorry to say that I do not see how it is possible for me to come to Osmaston, between this time &amp; your intended trip to Yorkshire. The reason of this is that my sister M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Parker has the misfortune of having two unchristened children, &amp; I am going after the first week in August to stand Godfather to them: I was thinking (&amp; I hope you will excuse the coolness of my offering myself) that if you were at home: I could pay you a visit on my road to Cambridge.— When you write tell me what you think of this scheme.— I hope it will answer:</p>
<p>I do hope that when you are in Yorkshire, you will redeem your character in Entomology, it is a long time since you have mentioned taking any good insects.— I think you would be surprized if you were to see all my insects.—</p>
<p>Pray mention in your next letter how Uncle Edward<ref target="#foot.f1"/> is, we were all very sorry to hear he had been so unwell: Catherine begs that you will give her love Julia &amp; many thanks for her kind wish of seeing her at Osmaston, but is very sorry that it is impossible.</p>
<p>Believe me dear Fox | Yours most sincerely | Chas. Darwin</p>
