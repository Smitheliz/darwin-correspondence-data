                <div type="transcription">   
<p>I finished yesterday evening the first volume,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; I very sincerely congratulate you on having produced a <hi rend="underline">first-class</hi> book,—a book which certainly will last. I cannot doubt that it will take its place as a standard, not so much because it contains real solid matter, but that it gives a picture of the whole country,—one can feel that one has seen it (&amp; desperately uncomfortable I felt in going over some of the Bridges, &amp; steep slopes) &amp; one <hi rend="underline">realises</hi> all the great Physical features. You have in truth reason to be proud: consider how few Travellers there have been with a profound knowledge of one subject, &amp; who could in addition make a map (which by the way is one of the most distinct ones, I ever looked at, wherefore blessings alight on your head) &amp; study geology &amp; meterelology! I thought I knew you very well, but I had not the least idea that your Travels were your Hobby, but I am heartily glad of it, for I feel sure that the time will never come, when you &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Hooker will not be proud to look back at the labour bestowed on these beautiful volumes. Your letter, received this morning has interested me <hi rend="underline">extremely</hi>, &amp; I thank you sincerely for telling me your old thoughts &amp; aspirations.— All that you say makes me even more deeply gratified by the Dedication; but you <hi rend="underline">bad</hi> man, do you remember asking me how I thought Lyell would like the work to be dedicated to him? I remember how strongly I answered &amp; I presume you wanted to know what I should feel: who ever would have dreamed of you being so <hi rend="underline">crafty</hi> ? I am glad you have shown a little bit of ambition about your Journal, for you must know, that I have often abused you for not caring more about Fame, though, at the same time, I must confess, I have envied &amp; honoured you for being so free (too free as I have always thought) of this “last infirmity of &amp;c.”<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Do not say “there never was a past hitherto to me,—the phantom was always in view”, for you will soon find other phantoms in view. How well I know this feeling &amp; did formerly still more vividly; but I think my stomach has much deadened my former, pure, enthusiasm for science &amp; knowledge.</p>
<p>I am writing an unconscionably long letter, but I must return to the Journals, about which I have hardly said anything in detail— Imprimis the illustrations &amp; maps appear to me the best I have ever seen;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> the style seems to me everywhere perfectly clear (how rare a virtue) &amp; some passages really eloquent. How excellently you have described the upper valleys, &amp; how detestable their climate, I felt quite anxious on the slopes of Kinchin, that dreadful snowy night.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Nothing has astonished me more than your Physical strength; &amp; oh those devilish Bridges;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> well thank goodness it is not <hi rend="underline">very</hi> likely that I shall ever go to the Himmalaya. Much in a scientific point of view has interested me,—especially all about those wonderful moraines.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I certainly think I quite realise the valleys,—more vividly perhaps from having seen the valleys of Tahiti; I cannot doubt that the Himmalaya, owe almost all their contour to <hi rend="underline">running</hi> water &amp; that they have been subjected to such action longer than any mountains, (as yet described) in the world.— What a contrast with the Andes! Perhaps you would like to hear the very little that I can say per contra, &amp; this only applies to the beginning, in which (as it struck me) there was not <hi rend="underline">flow</hi> enough till you got to Mirzapore on the Ganges, (but the Thugs were <hi rend="underline">most</hi> interesting)<ref target="#foot.f7"/> where the stream seemed to carry you on more equably with longer sentences &amp; longer facts &amp; discussions &amp;c.— In another Edition (&amp; I am delighted to hear that Murray<ref target="#foot.f8"/> has sold all off) I would consider whether this part could not be condensed. Even if the Metereology was put in Foot-notes, I think it would be an improvement. All the world is against me, but it makes me very unhappy to see the Latin names all in Italics &amp; all mingled with English names in Roman type, but I must bear this burden; for all men of Science seem to think it would corrupt the Latin to dress it in the same type as poor old English.</p>
<p>Well I am very proud of <hi rend="underline">my</hi> Book; but there is one bore, that I do not much like asking people whether they have seen it &amp; how they like it, for I feel so much identified with it, that such questions become rather personal. Hence I cannot tell you the opinion of others. You will have seen a fairly good review in Athenæum.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>What capital news from Tasmania:<ref target="#foot.f10"/> it really is a very <hi rend="underline">remarkable</hi> &amp; creditable fact to the Colony: I am always building veritable castles-in the air about emigrating, &amp; Tasmania has been my head quarters of late, so that I feel very proud of my adopted country; it is really a very singular &amp; delightful fact, contrasted with the slight appreciation of science in the Old Country.</p>
<p>I thank you heartily for your letter this morning, &amp; for all the gratification your Dedication has given me; I could not help thinking how much Murchison would despise you for not having dedicated it to some great man, who could have done you &amp; it some good in the eyes of the world.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Ah my dear Hooker you were very soft on this head, &amp; justify what I say about not caring enough for your own Fame. I wish I was in every way more worthy of your good opinion.</p>
<p>Farewell, how pleasantly M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Hooker &amp; you must rest from one of your many labours. We are very glad to hear such a good account of her;—but to walk so many hours,—is not a scolding wanted on <hi rend="underline">two</hi> heads?</p>
<p>Again farewell— I have written a wonderfully long letter. Adios, &amp; God Bless you | My dear Hooker | Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I see you allude to Lyells letter which interested me a good deal, but I confess I do not as yet see that he has made out any great feature in the Geology of the Island.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> The inclination of the lava-beds, I believe, refers exclusively to E. de Beaumonts data.</p>
<p>Sulivan has command of the Lightning, for the Surveying department of the Baltic Fleet.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>I have just looked over my rambling letter; I see that I have not at all expressed my strong admiration at the amount of scientific work, in so many branches, which you effected. It is really grand. You have a right to rest on your oars; or even to say, if it so pleases you, that “your Meridian is passed”; but well assured do I feel that the day of your reputation &amp; general recognition has only just begun to dawn.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The maps were from surveys made by Hooker chiefly with his own instruments, and the other illustrations were prepared from his own drawings (J. D. Hooker 1854a, 1: xvii).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Hooker had ascended Mon Lepcha, one of the lower peaks of Kinchinjunga, to a height of 13,000 ft, where he camped for several days. During that time, he and his party of Lepchas only just survived a dangerously heavy snowstorm, graphically described in J. D. Hooker 1854a, 1: 350–7.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">‘In these bridges, the principal chains are clamped to rocks on either shore, and the suspended loops occur at intervals of eight to ten feet; the single sal-plank laid on these loops swings terrifically, and the handrails not being four feet high, the sense of insecurity is very great.’ (J. D. Hooker 1854a, 1: 199).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Hooker described the giant moraines and the complicated sequence of deposits in the Yangma valley in J. D. Hooker 1854a, 1: 231–5. He believed these, and other similar beds of debris, were the residues of the former activity of glaciers and glacial lakes. This suggested that a glacial ocean had once stood ‘high on the Himalaya’ (p. 232), a view that CD would have found appealing.</note>

In March 1848, Hooker had met a Lieutenant Ward in Mirzapore, possibly <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4955.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">David Ward</ref>, a second lieutenant in the Bengal Engineers and one of the officials involved with the British suppression of ‘Thuggee’, and had been taken to see a Thug prisoner.
