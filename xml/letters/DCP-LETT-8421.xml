<p>In the first place allow me to thank you very much for the compliment you pay me, in suggesting that the results of my experiments in the fertilization of the Pelargonium family should be communicated to a scientific society. &amp; more especially for your kind offer to be the medium of its communication; believe me I thoroughly appreciate both the compliment &amp; your kindness.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>But you must permit me to observe, that it is one thing to write a paper for a Horticultural Congress, and another to do so for the Linnean Society, &amp; moreover one worthy of your introduction.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>An undertaking I hardly feel myself qualified to attempt, at any rate before doing so it would be necessary to decide (if possible) the essential point of my case, viz, the origin of the Duke of Cornwall, &amp; other var. in question.</p>
<p>From my statements it seems you assume them to be varieties only of the zonals I’ve tried to cross with them.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> if you refer to my paper, &amp; to the Florist, you will see I speak of them as being “<hi rend="underline">to all appearance</hi> but mere varieties of the zonal section”.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Hence the difficulty I speak of in the early part of my paper.. that for the want of some distinctive evidence, or line of demarcation, we are unable to decide what are varieties, &amp; what belong to distinct species.</p>
<p>There is I presume no means of ascertaining this—as regards the plants in question?</p>
<p>The Duke of Cornwall is a robust grower, but in all other respects, resembles both in flower &amp; foliage—the ordinary varieties of the Scarlet section; it is a very old variety, and at present I am quite unable to trace its parentage.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Beauté de Suresnes, &amp; D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Muret are similar in habit of growth; &amp; <hi rend="underline">of french origin</hi>, so I fear their history is not easily obtained either.</p>
<p>These varieties may possibly have sprung from one, &amp; a distinct parentage from the zonals I’ve tried to cross with them.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>For instance, in another section of the Pelargonium family.—the class known by the name of “<hi rend="underline">Fancies</hi>” seem to be quite distinct from the class called “<hi rend="underline">Show</hi>” or large flowering, for they will not cross, yet to all appearance they are sufficiently alike, to lead one to suppose them to be but varieties.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Therefore it seems to me, that unless I could prove that these varieties I name, have descended from the same parents as those I’ve attempted to cross with them, my case is worthless.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>In answer to your remark, I would observe I have tried hundreds of times, &amp; numerous varieties of the zonal section, to effect a cross <hi rend="underline">upon</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="underline">from</hi> these Var<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. failing to produce fructification in every instance, unless by using their pollen upon themselves or upon each other of these varieties. &amp; upon, or from the double varieties which sprang from Beauté de Suresnes.</p>
<p>With regard to the Ivy leaved variety—Peltatum Elegans, the case is clearer, for I suppose this section of the Pelargonium family—represents a distinct species “or a <hi rend="underline">supposed</hi> distinct species.” but with these I should like to continue my experiments at least another season, &amp; to let the results become more fully developed, &amp; more numerous, before reporting upon them to a scientific Society.</p>
<p>I am this season putting the pollen of Peltatum Elegans upon the zonal section—&amp; I seem to have some seed approaching maturity from <hi rend="underline">this</hi> cross; if so this variety of the Ivy-leaved section is reciprocally fertile with the zonal.</p>
<p>With regard to your remark respecting the exclusion of insects,—by the aid of a powerful glass,—there seems to me no difficulty in ascertaining that the stigma (in the pelargonium family) is in a state of <hi rend="underline">perfect virginity</hi>, viz, that there is not a grain of pollen on it; &amp; I assume that as soon as I have covered it completely with the desired pollen, that it is proof against the receipt of any other; or at any rate that the chances are as a thousand to one, against its becoming impregnated subsequently.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>The remarks I make in my paper—(you see) rather anticipate the probability of the influence resulting from constitution &amp;c. &amp;c. being different, when distinct species are employed, from my experiments on <hi rend="underline">varieties</hi>, so that Gärtners conclusions may be correct without upsetting mine.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>But to be able to form any decided opinion upon the various points mooted at the commencement of my paper, we require an accumulation of reliable evidence.—&amp; facts more distinctly given than I’ve yet seen.</p>
<p>I am now trying some experiments in crossing Lilies of <hi rend="underline">more opposite</hi> characters, to see the effects of parentage in that family, as regards transmission of size, shape, color, &amp; perfume.</p>
<p>Professor Dyer tells me he has Gärtners works in hand, but it did not appear to be clear, how soon they would be ready for publication.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>We took some steps at our meeting on Wednesday of the Roy. Horticultural Society regarding Ayrton’s scandalous conduct towards D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker. Not at all too soon for as I took the liberty to remark, it was a disgrace to the Society not to have been <hi rend="underline">the first</hi> to move in the matter<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f5">The scarlet section was one of the sections into which pelargoniums had been divided by Richard <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5917.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Colt Hoare</ref> in 1821. Hoare’s classification reflected the priorities of horticultural hybridisers rather than being based upon botanical characters (see also <ref target="./DCP-LETT-8407.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from John Denny, 12 July 1872</ref>, n. 2). The scarlet section contained some of the earliest hybrids, but there was little evidence of the origin of these plants. By the 1840s it was unclear even which plants were being referred to as scarlet pelargoniums. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8383.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wilkinson 2007</ref>, pp. 84–6, 131–3.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6">From the 1850s the French had become keen pelargonium breeders and the variety ‘Beauté de Suresnes’ was widely used for the production of hybrids. Attempts were made to distinguish which of these plants were zonal pelargoniums, but in 1867 a Paris commission of horticulturists found the task impossible and instead divided the plants according to colour. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8383.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wilkinson 2007</ref>, p. 202.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Both fancy and show pelargoniums had been developed by florists; fancy types had round flat flowers with all five petals often of the same colour and show types had large blotches on the two large upper petals (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8383.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wilkinson 2007</ref>, pp. 161–2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">One of Denny’s aims in producing as many crosses as possible in the scarlet section of pelargoniums was to determine whether the influence of the parents was the same when crossing varieties as when crossing species.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">CD’s own researches had shown that this was not the case; see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 2: 187, and CD’s conclusions in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8595.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Cross and self fertilisation</hi></ref>, pp. 391–2.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">In Denny 1872a, p. 904, Denny alluded to ‘the possible difference in the respective influence of the parents in true hybridisation’, that is, when species rather than varieties are crossed.
