<p>It was with great pleasure that I lately received the copy of your “Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the same Species” which you have so kindly presented to me:—pray accept my sincere thanks for the welcome gift.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I have read the book with great interest, particularly the chapter relating to cleistogamic flowers. I had no notion that such extraordinary flowers existed in so many genera of widely-separated groups as those given in your list. In common with most naturalists, I cannot be sufficiently grateful to you for your researches into plant physiology and economy—they impress me even more than your equally admirable investigations of animal life. I declare that, if you go on in this amazing manner to raise vegetable organisms in respect and estimation, I shall feel it a simple duty to agitate for a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Plants! Since you taught us what orchids were capable of, I have always had my misgivings as to “pulling” flowers for mere bouquets or decoration. It is terrible to think of the infinite maiming and maltreatment plants everywhere undergo, even from those “sweet-hearted” ones</p>

<p>I was in England last year, but only for two months (August and September), and even for that brief time was quite immersed in official scribbling in London,—being not on leave but on duty with the Cape Premier, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Molteno. For the present, I am happily quit of ordinary official business (which for the last few years has almost monopolized me), as the long-neglected Museum Curatorship has at length been constituted a Civil Service appointment, and the Government has relieved me from other duties.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Most people seem to think that this arrangement is “too bright, too pure, to last”;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> and it certainly is quite on the cards that a new Ministry or a frugally-minded Parliament might upset it;—but it has at any rate weathered the Session just over, and will I trust be more lasting than people anticipate.</p>
<p>One of the Museum Trustees, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Charles Fairbridge (who is a Member of the Legislative Assembly for Cape Town) left us about a month ago for a holiday in Europe, taking his family with him. Both publicly and privately he has been always a staunch helper of the Museum, and I perpetually regret that his absorbing legal business leaves him hardly any leisure for Natural History pursuits. I have ventured to give him your address, knowing that it would afford him much pleasure to meet you. He has been in correspondence with Sir J. Lubbock about arrow-heads etc. found in these parts, and will probably be visiting that gentleman while in England.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>The constant evidence of continued work which your books afford make me trust that your health is stronger than it was. If there is any little point to which you think I can attend out here with service to your labours, pray command me at any time.</p>
<p>With true regard, and renewed thanks for your kind remembrance of me, I remain | Very faithfully yours | R. Trimen</p>
