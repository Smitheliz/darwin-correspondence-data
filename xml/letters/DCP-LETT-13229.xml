<p>I have told Collier that he had now better write to you direct at whatever time he intends to make his final arrangements with you as to place and time of sitting.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He has just finished a portrait of me, which my mother had painted as a present to my wife. It is exceedingly good, and as all his recent portraits are the same—notably one of Huxley—I am very glad that he is to paint you.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Besides, he is such a pleasant man to talk to, that the sittings are not so tedious as they would be with a less intelligent man.</p>
<p>I shall certainly read the ‘Creed of Science’ as soon as I can.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The German book on Evolution I have not yet looked at, as I have been giving all my time to my own book.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> This is now finished. But talking of my time, I do not see how the two or three hours which I have spent in arranging to have a portrait, which will be of so much historical importance, taken by a competent artist, could well have been better employed.</p>
<p>You will see that I have got into a row with Carpenter over the thought-reading. Everybody thinks he made a mistake in lending himself to Bishop’s design of posing as a scientific wonder. Bishop is a very sly dog, and has played his cards passing well. In an article which he published two years ago in an American newspaper, he explains the philosophy of advertising, and says the first thing to attend to is to catch good names. He has now succeeded well.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">In an article titled ‘Thought-reading’, <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, 23 June 1881, pp. 171–2, Romanes had criticised <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_839.xml">William Benjamin Carpenter</ref>’s decision to recommend the thought-reader <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8968.xml">Washington Irving Bishop</ref> to the attention of a large assembly of scientists.  The article described experiments that Romanes took part in with a few other men of science, with Bishop’s co-operation, which he felt showed that Bishop’s thought-reading feats depended on his ability to detect unconscious muscular movements in the ‘thinkers’. In a letter to <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, 30 June 1881, pp. 188–9, Carpenter wrote that he had never attributed Bishop’s powers to anything other than the ability to detect muscular indications in others, and described a card trick that Bishop had demonstrated to him. On Bishop, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9808.xml">Wiley 2012</ref>; on Carpenter’s involvement, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_9807.xml">Delorme 2014</ref>.
