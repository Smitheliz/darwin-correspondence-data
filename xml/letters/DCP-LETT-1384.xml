                    <p>p. 36.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> —<hi rend="underline">pozzolana</hi> I actually
                            found bolts of iron embedded with conglomerate at the C. Verds.
                            p. 21 Volcanic Isl<hi rend="superscript">ds</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>p. 40 is it correct that wood in the ground (not peat-bog) lasts
                            longer than in water— this sounds very strange to me.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p> 
                    <p>p. 66. The opening sentence makes me groan, viz
                            your saying denudation is owing to “running water”, for breakers cannot
                            be called running water— you seem to preclude beach or tidal action— I
                            know it is only in expression.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p> 
                    <p>p. 81. ought you
                            not to add earthquakes to causes of formation of alluvium.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It strikes me that a very little more ought to
                            be said about sand-dunes—coral-sand—Laterite Kunkaer.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p> 
                    <p>p. 85. “<hi rend="underline">In some cases</hi>,
                            the alluvium in which” &amp;c— Surely is not the tendency of all
                            researches to show that <hi rend="underline">in most cases</hi>, the
                            alluvium or superficial drift, (even so-called vegetable black mould in
                            S. America) is of marine origin.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Ought not a short account to be given of the Aralo-Caspian deposits of
                                Murchison?<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p> 
                    <p>p. 88. Even in shortest account
                            of Glen Roy, notice ought to be taken of the intermediate shelf, of Tom
                            Brahn which so clearly proves that the roads or beaches are not at all
                            necessarily conterminous with the old expanses of water.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p> 
                    <p>p. 113 At Coquimbo there is another case of (1)
                            a bed with all recent shells in same proportion as on beach— (2) of a
                            bed with recent shells, but in different proportion (3) of nearly all
                            extinct species.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p> 
                    <p>p. 208. I think the
                            S. American Tertiaries deserve a paragraph, if merely from area; where
                            else can you travel uninterruptedly for at least 42<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. Lat: or 1620 over Tertiaries, without a
                            sign of disturbance, fault or flexure: for 600 miles the formation
                            contains only extinct shells— How grand is the superimposed
                            contemporaneous basaltic lava, which has extended in a sheet 100 miles
                            from source, &amp; at end is 130 ft thick. In Chile it appears to me
                            very interesting to find <hi rend="underline">old</hi>, apparently
                            Eocene, tertiaries, <hi rend="underline">not</hi> indicating a hotter
                            climate than that of Latitude in which they occur.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/> p. </p>
                    <p>217. The coral-mud is actually seen to be
                            transported out of the opening, discoloring the sea, from the Maldivas
                                atolls.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p> 
                    <p>p. 228 “Cypris, an animal <hi rend="underline">allied</hi> to the Crustacea”— you might as well
                            say a seal or whale was <hi rend="underline">allied</hi> to the
                                mammalia.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> p. 282. Those who do not know you
                            to be an Entomologist, would think fromap-position of words, that you
                            fancied that “Carabus” was a “wood-eater”.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/></p>
                            <p>p. 273. I wish you had grappled with d’orbigny &amp; others who speak of
                            every species as distinct in the stages of the Chalk &amp; Oolites<ref target="#foot.f16"/></p> 
                    <p>p. 301 The Permian Chapter strikes me as rather
                            short: one wants to hear a bit more about Russia<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p> <p>p. 362. I will always protest against your distinction of Recent
                            &amp; Post-pliocence.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/> I declare, I think it
                                w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be a good thing if your most useful
                            Table had been printed at the beginning as well as at the end of the
                            Chapters describing special Formations.<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p> 
                    <p>p. 376.
                            In the list, Palagonite of Bunsen ought to be introduced<ref target="#foot.f20"/>
                    </p>
<p>If you intend your Manual to serve as an Introduction to a student going to a Volcanic district &amp; as a guide to him what to observe, the Chapters strike me as very scanty &amp; incomplete: (by incomplete I do not mean to say a word against all that is, which strikes me as excellent, only I think more is wanted.) surely particulars about “fluidity of lavas” inclination of streams—preexisting crystals—details on nature of amygdaloids—inclined strata within craters—obsidian—dolerite—Bombs—vaulted streams—ejected granitic fragments—tuff which has flowed as mud—blown up masses—subsided masses—state of surface of lava—effects of hot lava on underlying matter. &amp;c &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>In Cleavage discussion, it appears to me to be the gravest omission to leave out all allusion to Dan. Sharpes facts about change in shape in shells, with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hopkins discussion on subject, which latter I presume you do not disbelieve in—<ref target="#foot.f22"/> I cannot doubt that Sharpes facts are most important with respect to origin of cleavage— Do you bring out prominently enough, the vast areas with uniform strike, but varying dip of cleavage;<ref target="#foot.f23"/> its parallelism to ranges of mountains &amp; areas of elevation?.— I presume you do not believe in the Fan-like structure as held by Sharpe, &amp; as stated to be case with foliated rocks by Studer.<ref target="#foot.f24"/></p>
<p>With respect to foliated rocks, I wish you had read my few pages on subject which I see you have not; I do not at all suppose that all gneiss has actually flowed: the analogy from the obsidian layers is not by any means my chief argument.— In fact you seem at end of discussion willing to grant <hi rend="underline">almost</hi> all I want, when you state that cleavage planes might be converted into the layers of various mineralscom-posing the metamorphic schists; for then these w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not be due to deposition.—<ref target="#foot.f25"/></p> 
                    <p> p. 468. I am astonished at your comparing the undulations in these schists to ripple-marks: is not d’Aubuissons explanation of expansion by heat far more probable?—<ref target="#foot.f26"/> Does it not appear odd to you that the outline &amp; diverse composition of pebbles <hi rend="underline">not</hi> being preserved, when, on your view, millions of layers of sediment have been perfectly preserved?</p>
<p>You know that even Sedgwick admits a grain in Plutonic rocks; &amp; such I most certainly have seen, where it was very difficult to make any clear distinction from gneiss.— But enough, &amp; too much you will say.— I will only add that the fact, which I clearly saw in T. del Fuego, that in simple clay-slate there were <hi rend="underline">slight</hi> mineralogical differences in the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">cleavage</hi> laminæ, seem to me important.<ref target="#foot.f27"/></p> <p> p. 472.— The passage quoted from me had better be struck out: I told you so before, but I presume you forgot.— I am fearful I may have blundered.—<ref target="#foot.f28"/> </p>
<p>In your capital Mineral vein Chapter, might you not give some facts of the wide diffusion of the metals; some chemists have, I think, detected Copper in sea-water.— As illustrating the adhesion of metal to plutonic &amp; hot volcanic districts; would it not be worth contrasting the entire ignorance of all metals in the inhabitants of the Pacific islands, with the aborigins of S. America.—<ref target="#foot.f29"/></p>
<p>P.S. I <hi rend="doubleUnderline">earnestly beg</hi> you to read just 5 pages in my vol. on <hi rend="underline">S. America</hi>, p. 162 et Seq. on Foliation, for I am interested on the subject.—<ref target="#foot.f30"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">On the letter Lyell inserted ‘x’ before ‘p. 36’, but no change was made in the fourth edition. The question concerned the hardness of strata consolidated under water, and CD’s comments in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8001.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Volcanic islands</hi></ref>, pp. 21–2, confirmed Lyell’s point. Pozzolana is an artificial stone, hardened in sea water, and formerly used by the Romans for building works. In his copy of C. Lyell 1851a, p. 36, CD underlined ‘may’ and ‘the artificial mixture’.</note>

On the letter, ‘x’ was inserted before ‘p. 66’, and a vertical line was drawn through the comment. Lyell changed the text of the fourth edition (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5016.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1852</ref>, p. 66) to read ‘by water in motion, whether of rivers or of the waves and currents of the sea’.</note>

On the letter Lyell bracketed CD’s comments on p. 81, wrote ‘4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> E<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.’ before the page number, and drew a vertical line through the comment.

A paragraph on the Aralo-Caspian deposits was added to the fifth edition (C. Lyell 1855, p. 176). The Aralo-Caspian deposits are described in Murchison, Verneuil, and Keyserling 1845, 1: 297–324.</note>

However, a reference to Tombhran and CD’s explanation of the non-extension of certain shelves appears in C. Lyell 1855, pp. 88–9. For CD’s discussion of the intermediate shelf on Tombhran, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6177.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Observations on the parallel roads of Glen Roy’</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 1: 112–13).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f11">Although Lyell marked this comment in the same manner as the preceding one, no mention of the Coquimbo shells was made in either the fourth or the fifth edition. For CD’s description of the Coquimbo shells, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7343.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">South America</hi></ref>, pp. 36–7, 128–30.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f12">Lyell made no use of this information, though on the letter he again bracketed the comment and marked it ‘5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Ed’. CD had discussed the climate in Chile during the Tertiary period in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7343.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">South America</hi></ref>, pp. 134–5, and supported Lyell’s view that the tropical climate during the Tertiary period in Europe was a local, not global, phenomenon.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f13">No use was made of this comment in either the fourth edition or the fifth, although on the letter it was marked ‘5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>’ by Lyell.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f14">In the fourth edition Lyell changed the wording to ‘an animal belonging to the Crustacea’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5016.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1852</ref>, p. 228), and in the fifth, to ‘a genus of Crustaceans’ (C. Lyell 1855, p. 262).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f15">Lyell had written ‘insects from the lias … comprise both wood-eating and herb-devouring beetles of the Linnean genera <hi rend="italic">Carabus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Elater</hi>, &amp;c.’ (C. Lyell 1851a, p. 282). In both the fourth and fifth editions (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5016.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1852</ref>, 1855) he altered the wording to read: ‘<hi rend="italic">Elater</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Carabus</hi>, &amp;c.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f16">Although this comment was marked ‘5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Ed.’ by Lyell on the letter, no reference to the views of Alcide Charles Victor Dessalines d’Orbigny or of any other naturalist was incorporated in this section of the fourth edition.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f17">In the fifth edition (C. Lyell 1855, p. 358), Lyell added references to Murchison, Verneuil, and Keyserling 1845 and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5734.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Murchison 1854</ref> but did not add to his description of the Permian rocks in Russia.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f18">The distinction was made in a ‘Tabular view of fossiliferous strata’ in the third edition (C. Lyell 1851a, p. 361). It was preserved in both the fourth and fifth editions.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f19">In the fifth edition (C. Lyell 1855), Lyell placed the table before the chapters describing the particular formations rather than following them.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f20">A list of volcanic rocks with their compositions appears in C. Lyell 1851a, pp. 375–7. Palagonite was included in the list in the fifth edition (C. Lyell 1855, p. 478), and a description of palagonite-tuff was added (p. 474).

CD refers to Robert Wilhelm Eberhard Bunsen.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f21">Lyell did not adopt CD’s suggestion that he enlarge the discussions of volcanic rocks to improve it as a guide to students. In the fifth edition (C. Lyell 1855), however, he added much new material as a result of observations he made during a visit to Madeira in the winter of 1854 (Ch. XXIX).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f23">CD’s observations of uniform strike over vast regions of South America were referred to in the fourth edition (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5016.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1852</ref>, pp. 471–2) and again, at greater length, in the fifth edition (C. Lyell 1855, p. 613).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f24">Lyell added to the fifth edition Sharpe’s view (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7133.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sharpe 1852</ref>, 1855) that cleavage and foliation planes in certain regions ‘are parts of great curves or anticlinal axes’ (C. Lyell 1855, p. 615). <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7133.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sharpe 1852</ref>, p. 448, made the point that the fan-like structure resulted from combining portions of two arches. No reference to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7532.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Studer 1851–3</ref> was made, but CD’s observations on the same point in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7343.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">South America</hi></ref>, p. 155, were added.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f25">It was CD’s contention that cleavage in slaty rocks and foliation in metamorphic schists were caused by mechanical processes and were unrelated to the original sedimentary depositions.

            <note xml:id="foot.f26">Lyell made no change in his use of the term ‘ripple-mark’ to describe the undulations in schists.

            <note xml:id="foot.f28">The passage concerned CD’s observations on the structural changes that take place in the mud-slag from the gold mines of Yaquil, Chile.
