<p>I arrived at this stupid place about three weeks ago, but have had no quiet time for writing till now.— I am staying here, on exactly the same principle, that a person chooses to remain in the Kings bench.— Talking of poverty puts me in mind to give you a scolding: in your answer to my letter containing the reasons I could not come to Epperstone, you say you do not wonder at my not choosing to to come to so stupid a place. now treating the thing logically, 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> you <hi rend="underline">must</hi> have know what you call stupid, is just what I like, &amp; 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> you <hi rend="underline">might</hi> have know, that if I could, I would most assuredly have come if it were merely for the pleasure of seeing you you have no excuse, &amp; are (as we say in Spanish) un grandisimo bribon.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I hope your prints arrived safe. I was in a perfect whirlwind of dust &amp; confusion, when I sent them off, else I should have written with the box.— The Canary scheme goes on very prosperously. I am working like a tiger for it, at present Spanish &amp; Geology,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> the former I find as intensely stupid, as the latter most interesting. I am trying to make a map of Shrops: but dont find it so easy as I expected.—</p>
<p>How goes on Entomology with you? you are in a capital situation, that is if Sherwood forest is at all like the New forest.— Hope &amp; Eyton did wonders the〈re〉 (I did not go propter pecuniam). Your imagination cannot fancy the number of red elater, melasis, Cerambycidous insects, without end.— I am just beginning Diptera.— L. Jenyns started me, what an excellent naturalist he is. I have seen a good deal of him lately, &amp; the more I see the more I like him.— I feel just the same way towards another man, whom I used formerly to dislike, that is Ramsay of Jesus,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> who is the most likely person (I dont know whether I told you before) to be my companion to the Canaries.— How much do you know of the particulars of our plans?</p>
<p>Shall you be at Epperstone in the Autumn, &amp; if you are, would be convenient, if I could manage to pay you a visit—answer this sincerely.— Cannot you pay me a visit at Shrewsbury, is it impossible?</p>
<p>This letter is all about myself. Do thou likewise, good Bye | dear old Fox. C. Darwin</p>

Later, speaking of Sedgwick’s speculation about the probable antiquity of the world, CD exclaimed, ‘What a capital hand is Sedgewick for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!’ (J.
