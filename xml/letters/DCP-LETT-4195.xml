<p>I 〈inclose〉 you Dennen’s letter which I have just received.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I do so because it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> give me a good deal of trouble to epitomize the contents of it, but I must request you to consider it <hi rend="underline">private</hi>, for it is a stupid letter and if made use of would raise perhaps an <hi rend="underline">unfair</hi> prejudice against him, it was written to me certainly in confidence— I have told him in reply that the case is simply this— The Savings Bank is founded to protect the savings of the poor, to induce &amp; enable them to invest their savings where they will be secure instead of risking them with adventurers for the sake of hig〈her〉 interest, and therefore he o〈ug〉ht not to have made such a pr〈op〉osition to Percival—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have not in〈s〉isted on knowing who the partie〈s were〉 to whom the money was to hav〈e〉 been lent, because perhaps it would be a breach of confidence on his part to disclose the name—</p>
<p>It appears to me that he has been only very stupid; perhaps you will kindly let me know whether you think the matter ought to be formally brought to the knowledge of the Trustees.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I would not bring it forward as a <hi rend="underline">charge</hi> against the poor little man, but merely as a matter which ought to be noticed. I am almost of opinion that if you do not mind the trouble, it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be well for Dennen to call on you when convenient to you to see him and then you might obtain from him such explanation as you think it right he should give. He has certainly done the work of the Bank carefully and well. he appears to be trustworthy. by the system now adopted at the Bank no money passes through his hands, he does not in any way intervene between the Depositor &amp; the Manager and he has in no instance that I am aware of sought to do so   he understands accounts— any public en〈qu〉iry into this business would certainly so far prejudice him as to lose him support in any application for employment in a responsible situation. I therefore would not publish this affair without due consideration, &amp; hope you will not do so—</p>
