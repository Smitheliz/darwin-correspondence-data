<p>I was at Worcester yesterday, &amp; went to the blind school, which I found very interesting; the Master M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blair seemed a sensible man. he said positively that he had two boys in the school born blind who blushed when corrected &amp;c (he only has 7 or 8) &amp; his wife said he had observed the boy I came to see (who was born blind) blush the day before on coming into the room where a lady was waiting to see him (the boy is 9 or 10), I afterwards asked him if he knew what blushing was, &amp; he seemed to know perfectly &amp; said he had often felt his face tingle with it.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blair is going to ask the Master of a large blind school at Worcester, &amp; is going to write me a line.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am sure any other questions you might put to him, he would be very glad to answer; he said he was reading some German book on the blind, &amp; if he came across anything he would let me know.</p>
<p>The way they do arithmetic algebra trigonometry is wonderful. he has one boy now staying with him on vacation from Dublin University, &amp; he hopes he will take a very high degree &amp; become professor of something or other.</p>
<p>Please tell Hen. I went to the Worcester porcelain works, &amp; was smit with a small triplet flower-vase, &amp; as a chip had take the edge off the price, I yielded after a struggle, &amp; she will receive it in a day or so<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>It is splendid your getting a new edition out in America so soon.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I hope you are all brisk.</p>
<p>I am better, &amp; only have one bath a day.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>

<p>M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Blair said that tho’ the blind are born unconscious of being observed, that to teach them they are so is a great part of their education.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
