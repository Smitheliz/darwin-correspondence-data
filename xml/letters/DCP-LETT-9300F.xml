                        <p>I am very much obliged for your kindness in having sent me so many curious particulars with respect to animals.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Formerly I disbelieved in the inheritance of mutilations, but sufficient facts have now been established to render the extraordinary fact credible.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> With respect to the suicide of animals, I do not think any one of a sceptical frame of mind will believe in such cases. The dog which was killed on the railroad may have been paralyzed with terror, or been on the point of suffering from epilepsy, to which dogs are liable, and such wild explanation seems to me more probable than that a dog should know what death is, and voluntarily incur it.</p> 
                           <p>With many thanks for your kindness, I remain, dear madame, | Yours very faithfully, | CHARLES DARWIN. </p>
