<p>I am through my little Go,!!!<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I am too much exalted to humble myself by apologising for not having written before.— But, I assure you before I went in &amp; when my nerves were in a shattered &amp; weak condition, your injured person often rose before my eyes &amp; taunted me with my idleness. But I am through through through. I could write the whole sheet full, with this delightful word.— I went in yesterday, &amp; have just heard the joyful news.— I shall not know for a week, which class I am in.— The whole examination is carried on in a different system. It has one grand advantage, being over in one day. They are rather strict; &amp; ask a wonderful number of questions:</p>
<p>And now I want to know something about your plans: <hi rend="underline">of course</hi> you intend coming up here: what fun we will have together, what beetles we will catch, it will do my heart good to go once more together to some of our old haunts: I have two very promising pupils in Entomology, &amp; we will make regular campaigns into the Fens; Heaven protect the beetles &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jenyns, for we wont leave him a pair in the whole country. My new cabinet is come down &amp; a gay little affair it is.—</p>
<p>And now for the time, I think I shall go for a few days to Town, to hear an Opera &amp; see M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hope; not to mention my brother also whom I should have no objection to see.— If I go pretty soon, you can come afterwards but if you will settle your plans definitely, I will arrange mine. So send me a letter by return of post:— And I charge you let it be favourable, that is to say come directly.—</p>
<p>Holden has been ordained, &amp; drove the Coach out on the Monday, I do not think he is looking very well.— Chapman wants you &amp; myself to pay him a visit, when you come up, &amp; begs to be remembered to you. You must excuse this short letter, as I have no end more to send off by this days post.—</p>
<p>I long to see you again, &amp; till then | My dear good old Fox | I am yours most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
