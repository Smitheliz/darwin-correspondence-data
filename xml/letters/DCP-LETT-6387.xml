<p>I have today received a letter from Prof<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Huxley in which he mentions that my letter to him with a photograph was forwarded to you and he at the same time sent me your reply<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>By this post I have sent to your address the ear of wheat in question &amp; have registered the letter</p>
<p>The ear was lent to me by an intimate friend (the finder) who knew that I sought such objects and I feel certain that no tricks have been played with it except that a stupid farmer to whom he shewed it picked out a perfect oat kernel from the lower floret   indeed I do not think that if he tried he could accomplish it—</p>
<p>The specimen has now been given to me and having sent it to you I shall be glad to leave it entirely in your hands to send it to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hooker, or to whomsoever you please to have the matter thoroughly investigated<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Having read some Botany for amusement it occurred to me that this specimen if a true one might have some bearing on the variation of species and I was therefore unwilling that it should be passed over</p>
<p>I feel that in making any remark whatever on your letter that an unscientific person like myself is taking a liberty but if you will allow me to make one I will do so with the greatest respect</p>
<p>If the ear is soaked in water to dissolve any substance used to fix in a spurious stalk (if any) might not this soaking swell the natural and genuine stalk and so separate it from the main stem from which it really has grown?<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>If you will accept the specimen I shall be glad (if genuine) but I will ask you to be kind enough to inform me of the result of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hookers investigation</p>
<p>Should it turn out that I have found a mare’s nest I should be very sorry that you should have had any trouble in the matter</p>

Nunn’s forwarded letter to CD has not been found. CD included a reply for Nunn with his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-6381F.xml" resp="#automat" cert="medium">letter to Huxley of [13–21 September 1868]</ref>; this reply has also not been found, but see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-6393.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 25 September 1868</ref>, for its content. Nunn’s photograph was of an ear of wheat with what looked like two attached oat florets.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Nunn refers to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker</ref>.

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In his <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Nunn</ref> (see n. 1, above) CD had evidently written that the specimen must be soaked in order to determine that there had not been an accidental insertion of the oat florets (see letter to J. D. Hooker, 25 Spetember 1868).</note>
