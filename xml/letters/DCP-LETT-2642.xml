<p>By the same post with this, I have the pleasure of sending you a copy of my “Ventriculidæ”—of which I beg your acceptance.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> When you have a little leisure, I think you will find in its contents some matters more than usually illustrative of your views on the development of species. Not to take up, now, too much of your time, I will note two points:—first, here is a group of fossils entirely distinguished, by a very remarkable structure, from any other. We find them running thro’ all the Chalk formation—<hi rend="underline">but with a</hi> <hi rend="underline">difference</hi>. Indeed, when I opened your plate of graduating species,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I immediately remarked—“this is a table of the Ventriculidæ”. There is both the change &amp; branching off of many, &amp; the retention of single forms, just as you have pictured. (Let me refer to pp. 41–43, 55, 73, 88).</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Second</hi>, there is the difficulty of structure—a structure unapproached by any known structure, recent or fossil. This is a more difficult point than any of the <hi rend="underline">modifications</hi> of parts. But no doubt you will see the way, from your vast stores of comparison, to illustrate it. I can thus far illustrate it:—that, for years, I have lost no opportunity of pointing out to visitors to my collection, the “<hi rend="underline">imperfection of the geological record</hi>”, as illustrated by the Chalk fossils, &amp; the beds above &amp; below them. I could enlarge much on this,—but will only add, that two flints, compared, are enough to satisfy the most sceptical,—while we have, between the chalk &amp; the London clay, the distinct &amp; unquestionable <hi rend="doubleUnderline">marks</hi> of a <hi rend="underline">lost record</hi>—of which all the details are gone; &amp; what is left is only enough to tell us how much is wanting. I compare it to Livy’s History. We have some chapters tolerably complete. Of others we have the mere heads—but enough to know that they once existed.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>If it will be agreeable to you, at any future time, to see my collection, I shall have pleasure in showing it to you—&amp; pointing out the illustrations to which I have alluded.</p>
<p>Apologising for the length at which I am troubling you, | I am Dear Sir | Yours faithfully | Toulmin Smith <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Smith was the first president of the Geologists’Association, founded in 1859, and an expert on the Ventriculidae, fossilised siliceous sponges from the Cretaceous period. His papers on the Ventriculidae of the Chalk, printed in the <hi rend="italic">Annals and Magazine</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Natural History</hi>, were issued as a volume in 1848. A copy of this work (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7294.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. T. Smith 1848</ref>) is in the Darwin Library–Down.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Smith refers to the diagram in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, inserted between pp. 116 and 117, illustrating the principle of divergence.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Smith alludes to CD’s remark in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 310–11, that the geological record is like a history of the world imperfectly kept, of which only a short chapter here and there has been preserved. Titus Livius’s <hi rend="italic">History of Rome</hi> originally had 142 books, of which only 35 survive complete, along with fragments of others. For CD’s discussion of the fragmentary nature of the fossil record, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 279–311.</note>
