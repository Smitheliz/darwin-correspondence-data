                    <p>I have been horribly idle about sleeping plants for you but I will really have a good look   it is quite easy; I have seen a Zygophyllum fabago which sleeps pretty well 2 leaflets moving vertically upwards.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Porliera seems to be a different species; the twig you sent has very much the look of mine but has only 8 or 9 prs of leaflets &amp; that gives it a dumpy look compared with yrs.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I havn’t made it out properly— It certainly sleeps— twigs in water in the diffused light of this room are open all morning &amp; shut early about 3   They were open in a dark cupboard after about 24 hrs. A twig kept quite under water in blazing sun out of doors is open when the plant in bed has shut leaves. Under a bell glass in a glass of water &amp; standing in a plate of water it remained open in full sunlight   It seems to me it must depend on dampness but I half think it depends on being richly supplied with water, as a twig is in a a glass of water; as mine does not seem the same species I will try some more things.</p>
                    <p>The oats have only just begun to germinate I shall do some to day—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Sachs<ref target="#foot.f5"/> made a calculation &amp; said that at the most the little tip that appears at first could only manufacture make <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>6</mn><mn>1000</mn></mfrac></math></formula> of a milligramm dry weight in a day by assimilating; (a milligramm = <hi rend="superscript">1/70th</hi> grain). Germinating seeds do not gain in weight he says.</p>
<p>PM   I have cut sections of a young oat <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac></math></formula><hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inch above the ground—&amp; it has chlorophyll in it, Sachs looked &amp; said it <hi rend="underline">was</hi> chlorophyll but rather yellow, &amp; therefore not fully developed: Only 4 or 5 oats have come up as yet &amp; this was the smallest—I can get younger ones tomorrow morning I hope—sections is much better than alcohol which I always thought bosh.</p>
<p>Since writing about Porliera this morning I found another Porliera same species but in a pot &amp; not in open ground &amp; its leaves were wide open while the one in ground were shut. Sachs on theoretical grounds says the one in the bed gets more water, but I asked the gardener privately &amp; he on practical grounds says he waters the pot-plant every day &amp; never the bedded out one.</p>

Plants identified as <hi rend="italic">Porliera hygrometrica</hi> growing in Würzburg seemed to behave differently from the plant CD had received from Kew (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11575.xml">letter from Francis Darwin, [29 June] 1878</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11595.xml">letter to Francis Darwin, 7 [July 1878]</ref> and n. 2). <hi rend="italic">Porlieria hygrometrica</hi> is an unresolved name that has been used to refer to both <hi rend="italic">P. hygrometra</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P. chilensis</hi>; it is likely, based on the description of the leaflets, that CD’s specimen was the species now recognised as <hi rend="italic">P. hygrometra</hi>, while the Würzburg plants were <hi rend="italic">P. chilensis</hi>. Francis’s notes, dated between 12 and 26 July 1878, recording the movements of both specimens of <hi rend="italic">Porlieria</hi> from the Würzburg garden, are in DAR 209.14: 110–11.</note>
