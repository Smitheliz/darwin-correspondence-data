<p>A good chearful &amp; affectionate daughter is the greatest blessing a man can have after a good wife.— if I could have given such a wife to Charles without parting with a daughter there would be no drawback from my entire satisfaction in bestowing Emma upon him— You lately gave up a daughter—it is my turn now— At our time of life our happiness must be in a great measure reflected from our families, and I think there are few fathers who have on the whole more cause to be satisfied with the conduct &amp; present circumstances &amp; future prospects of our families.— I could have parted with Emma to no one for whom I could so soon &amp; so entirely feel as a father &amp; I am happy in believing that Charles entertains the kindest feelings for his uncle-father.</p>
<p>I propose to do for Emma what I did for Charlotte &amp; for three of my sons—give a bond for £5000 &amp; to allow her £400 a year as long as my income will supply it which I have no reason for thinking will not be as long as I live.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Give my love to your fireside and believe me | Affectionately yours | Josiah Wedgwood <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/> My dear Uncle</p>
<p>I have begged a bit of Papa’s letter to thank you from my heart for the delightful way in which you have received me into your family &amp; to thank my dear Marianne &amp; Susan for their affectionate notes which gave me the greatest pleasure. One of the things that give me most happiness is Charles’s thorough affection &amp; value for Papa. I am my dear Uncle yours affectionately | Emma W.</p>
<p>You will be glad to hear that Mamma has quite got over her disappointment about Miss Martineau &amp; amuses herself a good deal in planning about houses cake &amp;c.</p>
