<p>I am afraid you will be very angry with me for not having written during the Music Meeting, but really I was worked so hard that I had no time: I arrived here on Monday, &amp; found my rooms in dreadful confusion, as they have been taking up the floor, &amp; you may suppose that I have had plenty to do for these two days.—</p>
<p>The Music Meeting was the most glorious thing I ever experienced: &amp; as for Malibrand,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> words cannot praise he[r] enough, she is quite the most charming person I ever saw.— We had extracts out of several of the best Operas, acted in character, &amp; you cannot imagine, how very superior it made the concerts to any I ever heard before.—</p>
<p>J. de Begnis<ref target="#foot.f2"/> acted Il Fanatico<ref target="#foot.f3"/> in Character, being dressed up, an extraordinary figure gives a much greater effect to his acting. He kept the whole theatre in roars of laughter.— I liked Madam Blasis<ref target="#foot.f4"/> very much, but nothing will do after Malibrand; who sung some comic songs, &amp; persons heart must must have been made of stone not to have lost it to her.—</p>
<p>I lodged very near the Wedgwoods &amp; lived entirely with them, which was very pleasant, &amp; had you been there it would have been quite perfect.— It knocked me up most dreadfully, &amp; I never will attempt again to go to two things the same day.—</p>
<p>I passed through London on Sunday, but M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hope was not there: Weaver in Birmingham has a very good collection, but does not know much about them, &amp; I bought 15<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. worth of insects of him: one insect, if it is British, quite surpasses my knowledge.— Would you believe it, that I have the Endomychus coccineus, a bad specimen however, given me by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hope?— I hope you have found something in the Fungi: any how tell me when you, what you have done in Entomology.—</p>
<p>Cambridge is most wonderfully empty. Wilmer &amp; the Rev— Robinson<ref target="#foot.f5"/> are the only men up that you know: Poor Robinson has got to go in again for his degree as he had not entirely kept one of his terms.—</p>
<p>Your conjecture was perfectly right about the letter, when I came home I found it in my great big top-coat, to my sisters no small disgust &amp; indignation.— I suppose you have sent Stephens Catalogues to Shrewsbury, from whence I have ordered them to be sent here: it is a pity, as they have come so late, that they were sent for at all.— Do write soon &amp; tell me your plans. I earnestly hope that you mean to come up early &amp; stay for some time: it will be so very snug being together once more.—</p>
<p>Yours most sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
