                        <p>I send all 4 parts of Van Tieghem, &amp; will you  kindly return them as soon as done with, as I may wish to refer to them.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Frank thinks that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. find very useful for all terms “Elemente der Anat. &amp; Phys der Pflanzen” by Prof. Wiesner 1881.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It is only 276 pages in length with many excellent cuts. Frank cannot lend his copy, for it lies heavy on his conscience that he has not yet reviewed it for Nature as he promised to do.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                        <p>When you were here my brain told me that I had something to say, &amp; you had not left 2 minutes when the confounded molecules came to their senses. It was to urge you to retry (for I think that you had tried) the Belgian’s (Plateau?) experiments with artificial flowers. I tried nearly 40 years ago, &amp; as far as I can remember not a bee came near them. I showed them stuck in a flower garden in Staffordshire to William, who was then so young that he c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. hardly speak, &amp; the moment he saw them, he said “Mama’s bonnet”.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> So I bethought me if so young a child could recognise them why not a bee. I have occasionally been much struck with bees visiting a particular species, who have flown near a flower of another kind, but of nearly the same tint, how quickly they perceived it was the wrong species &amp; without alighting on the flowers.—</p>
                        <p>I once thought of getting (but shall never do so) an artificial flower maker to make as good a copy as he possibly could of the little Blue Lobelia for Hive-bees &amp; of the tall blue Larkspur for Humble-bees, &amp; then sticking them in the ground near the real flowers &amp; watch how the bees behaved.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Any bees that came down the wind c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not be guided by scent.— You w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. raise the bees in men’s estimation if you could show that they can distinguish by eye-sight natural from good artificial flowers,—</p>
