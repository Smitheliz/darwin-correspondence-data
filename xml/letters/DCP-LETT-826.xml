<p>I am much obliged for your very agreeable letter; it was very goodnatured, in the midst of your scientific &amp; theatrical dissipation, to think of writing so long a letter to me. I am astonished at your news &amp; I must condole with you in your <hi rend="underline">present</hi> view of the Professorship,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; most heartily deplore it on my own account. There is something so chilling in a separation of so many hundred miles, though we did not see much of each other when nearer.— You will hardly believe how deeply I regret for <hi rend="underline">myself</hi> your present prospects— I had looked forward to seeing much of each other during our lives. It is a heavy disappointment; &amp; in a mere selfish point of view, as aiding me in my work, your loss is indeed irreparable.— But on the other hand, I cannot doubt that you take at present a desponding, instead of bright view of your prospects: Surely there are great advantages, as well as disadvantages. The place is one of eminence; &amp; really it appears to me there are so many indifferent workers &amp; so few readers, that it is a high advantage, in a purely scientific point of view, for a good worker to hold a position, which leads others to attend to his work.— I forget whether you attended Edinburgh, as a student,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> but in my time, there was a knot of men who were far from being the indifferent &amp; dull listeners which you expect for your audience.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Reflect what a satisfaction &amp; honour it would be to <hi rend="underline">make</hi> a good Botanist—with your disposition you will be to many, what Henslow was at Cambridge to me &amp; others, a most kind friend &amp; guide.</p>
<p>Then what a fine garden, &amp; how good a Public Library; why Forbes<ref target="#foot.f4"/> always regrets the advantages of Edinburgh for work; think of the inestimable advantage of getting, within a short walk, of those noble rocks, &amp; hills &amp; sandy-shores near Edinburgh. Indeed I cannot pity you much, though I pity myself exceedingly in your loss.— Surely lecturing will in a year or too, with your <hi rend="underline">great</hi> capacity for work (whatever you may be pleased to say to the contrary) become easy &amp; you will have a fair time for your Antarctic Flora &amp; general views of distribution. If I thought your Professorship would stop your work, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> wish it &amp; all the good worldly consequences at el Diavolo: I know I shall live to see you the first authority in Europe on that grand subject, that almost key-stone of the laws of creation, Geographical Distribution.— Well there is one comfort, you will be at Kew, no doubt every year.—so I shall finish, by forcing down your throat my sincere congratulations.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your news— I grieve to hear Humboldt is failing;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> one cannot help feeling, though unrightly, that such an end is humiliating: even when I saw him he talked beyond all reason.— If you see him again, pray give him my most respectful &amp; kind compliments, &amp; say that I never forget that my whole course of life is due to having read &amp; reread as a Youth his Personal Narrative.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> How true &amp; pleasing are all your remarks on his kindness: think how many opportunities you will have, in your new place, of being a Humboldt to others. Ask him about the river in NE Europe, with the Flora very different on its opposite banks.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I have got &amp; read your Wilkes.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> what a feeble book in matter &amp; style, &amp; how splendidly got up. Shall I return it, (with your Sandwich Lists, which have interested me much; ah what labour) to Sir William.—</p>
<p>Do write me a line from Berlin—also thanks for the proof sheets; I did, not, however, mean proof-Plates: I value them, as saving me copying extracts.—</p>
<p>Farewell, my dear Hooker, with a heavy heart, I wish you joy of your prospects. | Your sincere friend | C. Darwin</p>
