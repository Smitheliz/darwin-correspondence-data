<p>Comment vous portez vous, Monsieur? Pretty well. Je suis ravi. Ah. Ah. What a charming shot you must be to have killed that young tyger, that you mentioned; it must have been very horrid, only suppose you had missed him &amp; that he had run at you. Bye the Bye. How came this tiger to be loose? You dont mention that. Is there any there any menagerie at Styche?<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But I begin to suspect this is like some other wonderful birds that you see with your pocket telescopes, or eyes whichever you please to call them.</p>
<p>There was a travelling mineral-seller here some time ago who made my mouth water with such a magnificent piece of amethystine quartz. The crystal was 4 or 5 inches long &amp; so beautiful, only the wretch asked a pound for it. He had an immense number, tho’ not variety of stones, &amp; I did see anything which you had not got.</p>
<p>I cant say <hi rend="underline">my cabinet</hi> increases very much I have got a piece of petrified sponge &amp; shall perhaps have a curious piece of coal which J. Price<ref target="#foot.f2"/> pulled out of his fire</p> 
<figure type="diagram"> 
<p>[DIAGRAM HERE]</p> </figure> 
<p>I have given you a sketch of it, the figs (<hi rend="underline">alpha</hi>) are little circular hollows and those (<hi rend="underline">beta</hi>) are little compressed tubercles. They are curiously mixed together in some places. He is going to shew it to the Prof. of Geology.</p>
<p>You cant think what a pretty bird the spotted Woodpecker is, if you never saw it There was one being stuffed here some time ago. There is a very beautiful work now publishing which you would like. Griffiths Animal Kingdom<ref target="#foot.f3"/> in Quarterly parts. 24 shillings each the best copies 1/2 a guinea the worst.</p>
<p>Price &amp; I are going to anatomize cows h〈  〉 &amp;c very vigorously as soon as he he 〈ha〉s time which I dont think you woul〈d〉 fanc〈y.〉</p>
<p>I this morning saw a curiously diseased liver &amp;c of a child who had died with a jaundice— I send you the sixpence &amp; pray dont make a beast of yourself with it</p>
<p>Let me hear from you again. | Love ad omnes | Greet Spark<ref target="#foot.f4"/> | yours, | E. D.</p>
<p>P.S. I can not make out whether you mean your P.S. for a quiz.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> If there was a list it was an old list of my own.</p>
<p>2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>. P.S. In the last No of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> An. of. Phil. The Editors so quizzed “self adjusting candles” &amp;c for the Blowpipe that I hardly know if I shall venture to send an account of my admirable candlestick.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>. P.S. If you know of any person coming to to Cambridge get him to carry up my “Samouelles Entomolog. Companion”.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> N.B it is a red book—</p>
