<p>My niece, the daughter of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wedgwood the philologist, has written a life of Wesley under the circumstances stated in the enclosed paper.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have not seen the M.S. but I know Miss Wedgwood to be a remarkably clever woman &amp; I know that she has bestowed much labour on this work, &amp; has consulted during many months, all sorts of authorities in the British Museum. She wrote the enclosed paper at my suggestion as I thought you would be willing to look at the M.S &amp; consider whether it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be worth your while to publish it. If you are not so inclined, perhaps you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be so kind as briefly to give her your impression of its deficiencies or merits.</p>
<p>I shall esteem it a great favour if you will thus far oblige me.</p>
<p>I received safely the clean sheets for the Italian translation. There will now be five foreign Translations!!<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>In my last note I asked you whether you c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> find out for me who published “The Sportman &amp; Nat. in Canada” by Major W. Ross King”; also whether you had rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> the stereotypes for Fritz Müller’s work—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>

<p>“<hi rend="underline">John Wesley &amp; the Evangelical reaction of the 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. century</hi>” was written for the “<hi rend="underline">Sunday Library</hi>” a series undertaken by Messrs Macmillan, &amp; rejected by the Publishers on a misunderstanding (chiefly the writer’s fault) as to the class of readers for whom the Series was designed.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> It was regarded as wanting in simplicity, &amp; implying too much culture in those addressed, &amp; as being less a plain narrative, than a dissertation on that movement of thought which to the writer appeared the most important fact in the life, &amp; of which Methodism was treated as an indication.</p>
<p>The style was also criticized as wanting in simplicity &amp; too full of allusion, not distinctly explained.</p>
<p>The MSS wd have filled two small volumes of that Series which contain 300 small pages each &amp; are printed in rather large type, about the size of the Pall Mall Gazette print.</p>
<p>If there is anything original in the work, it is the endeavour to trace a connection between the political principles of the eighteenth century, &amp; the course of religious thought. A small portion is in type.</p>

The book was eventually published by Macmillan, but not as part of any series (see n. 1, above). In the preface, Wedgwood commented: ‘The form in which it was originally designed that the following pages should appear, was one which excluded a frequent reference to authorities. The writer has endeavoured to remedy this defect by embodying them in the text, wherever this was practicable, and by the appended list of the principal books consulted.’</note>
