<p>Your case seems to me most perplexing;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have never seen or heard of anything like it, &amp; have been puzzling my brains quite in vain. One thing I quite see &amp; agree with you, that it is a <hi rend="underline">strong</hi> argument against the angle of (say) 12<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> having been produced by upheavement, for it is manifestly impossible that the columns in a flat field of lava could have been all formed at angles inclined from the centre of the island, so as to become vertical when the beds were upturned 12<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. The cause must (I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think) be connected with the lava not having absolutely ceased its downward tendency when the shrinking which produced the columns &amp; fissures was first superinduced.</p>
<p>Would it not be worth while to ask Hopkins or some such man,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> whether in a body of very viscid matter just before all motion ceased, whether there could be any vertical sliding movement in closely approximate planes <hi rend="doubleUnderline">tending</hi> to make (not really making) steps like these; 
    <figure rend="blockCentred width45">
        <graphic url="../images/dcp_lett_1855_1.jpg"/>
    </figure>
for if so I can well fancy such tendency might have <hi rend="underline">guided</hi> the planes of division of the columns.— I know I have seen some columnar lava with columns directed in manner for which I could conceive no cause, but I cannot remember where.—</p>
<p>I have seen <hi rend="doubleUnderline">very</hi> narrow, <hi rend="doubleUnderline">very</hi> convex streams of lava, (which must have been very viscid) with the proper radiating columnar structure beautifuly displayed.— 
    <figure rend="blockCentred width25">
        <graphic url="../images/dcp_lett_1855_2.jpg"/>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>Have I not read of Glaciers, coming down a very steep slope, breaking up into vertical steps?</p>
<p>Do make the <hi rend="underline">local</hi> areas crowded with parallel dikes a prominent feature, though I daresay you are very wise &amp; safe in allowing some central elevation of the whole. What a deal of interesting work your Madeira expedition has given you!<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Yours most truly | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>I supposed you observed your facts in Madeira &amp; not from drawings alone.— I have been drawing the angles on paper &amp; in <hi rend="underline">thin</hi> beds of lava, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have thought the difference w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. not have been conspicuous; in <hi rend="underline">thick</hi> beds it undoubtedly would</p>
<p>Has not Forbes,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> or Hopkins or some one given figure of some very viscid substance flowing down slope, with plane of division, something like this? — 
    <figure rend="blockCentred width45">
        <graphic url="../images/dcp_lett_1855_3.jpg"/>
    </figure>
I have some <hi rend="underline">vague</hi> idea I have seen such— The planes AA, if ever so obscure, might well guide the formation of adjoining columns, &amp; then the rest of the columns.</p>
<p>The more I think the more inclined I am to think that some such view must be cause of your, as it seems to me very important &amp; extraordinary fact.— The longitudinal planes of division in a lava-stream, could have no effect, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> think, on the dip of the columns.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Dated by the subject of the letter, a topic that was discussed during Lyell’s visit to Down House, 13–16 April 1856 (see n. 2, below).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Lyell had recently visited CD at Down House (Wilson ed. 1970, p. xliii). An unpublished letter from Lyell to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2157.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Georg Hartung</ref>, dated 11 and 15 April 1856, indicates that Lyell and CD had discussed the geology of Madeira in great detail, with particular reference to the angle at which molten lava could solidify (the editors thank Lady Lyell and Leonard G. Wilson for this information). The point was crucial in the debate, at that time still continuing, between Lyell and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_697.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Christian Leopold von Buch</ref> and Jean Baptiste Armand Louis Léonce Élie de Beaumont. Lyell held the view that volcanic cones were built up gradually, layer by layer, through the accumulated outpourings of lava, a theory proposed in detail in C. Lyell 1850; Leopold von Buch considered that lava could not solidify on slopes and that the beds must at first have been horizontal and only subsequently elevated and inclined. CD had discussed Lyell’s argument at length in 1849 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1264.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Charles Lyell, [1 November 1849]</ref>, and subsequent letters).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2380.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Hopkins</ref> was an expert in mathematical geology (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7257.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Smith 1989</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Charles and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3056.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Mary Elizabeth Lyell</ref>, accompanied by Frances Joanna and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_722.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles James Fox Bunbury</ref>, visited Madeira and the Canary Islands in the winter of 1853–4 to study the volcanic phenomena of the islands. Some of the results of Lyell’s observations were incorporated into the fifth edition of his <hi rend="italic">Manual</hi> (C. Lyell 1855, pp. 515–22). The paper on the volcanic geology of Madeira and the Canaries, which Lyell and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2157.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Georg Hartung</ref> were preparing, was ultimately abandoned. Lyell discussed the question, in part, in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5023.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Lyell 1858</ref>. Hartung later published, with Lyell’s permission, the results of their work (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_3406.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hartung 1864</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1681.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">James David Forbes</ref> had analysed the physical properties of glaciers in 1845 and considered that they moved primarily through acting as a viscous mass. CD had corresponded with him about the similarity of movement in glaciers and lava (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 3, letters to J. D. Forbes, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-781.xml" resp="#automat">11 October [1844]</ref> and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-786.xml" resp="#automat">[November? 1844]</ref>). Forbes was at that time engaged in a bitter controversy with <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2380.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Hopkins</ref>, who had opposed the viscous theory with his own theory of motion based on sliding. CD’s reference in the letter indicates that he meant Forbes’s work rather than Hopkins’s (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7257.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">C. Smith 1989</ref>). There are several diagrams similar to the one in this letter in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2596.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. D. Forbes 1845</ref>, pp. 368–436.</note>
