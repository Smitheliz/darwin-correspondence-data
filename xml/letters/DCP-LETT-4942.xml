            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD evidently sat for a photographer during his stay in London, from 8 to 20 November 1865. This may have been <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5315.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ernest Edwards</ref>, who supplied photographs for the series <hi rend="italic">Portraits of men of eminence in literature, science, and art, with biographical memoirs</hi> (Reeve and Walford eds.1863–7). CD had agreed to appear in the series (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-5508.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Edward Walford, 22 [January–April 1865?]</ref> and n. 2). An entry in CD’s Classed account book (Down House MS) records a payment of £1 for ‘E. Edwards Photo’ on 2 March 1866. According to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242), CD did not visit London again until 22 April 1866.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">The photographs of CD by Edwards appear to have been taken at two different sittings. It is likely that the portrait used in <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4926.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Edward Walford’s</ref> series was taken in 1866, during CD’s visit to London from 22 April to 1 May (see Reeve and Walford eds. 1863–7, 5: facing 49, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_995.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Browne 1998</ref>, pp. 269–71). Another photograph of CD by Edwards, possibly taken at the November 1865 sitting, is reproduced as the frontispiece to this volume, and in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_995.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Browne 1998</ref>, p. 256. Photographs from both sittings were sold commercially as cartes de visite by the London Stereoscopic Company and the firm of Edwards and Bult. CD evidently purchased copies of one or more of these photographs for his own use. A second payment, of £3 8<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> was made to Edwards on 5 September 1866 (CD’s Classed account book (Down House MS)).</note>

According to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary (DAR 242), CD and Emma had stayed with Erasmus in London from 8 to 20 November; CD became feverish on the 20th and did not improve until the 27th (see also ‘Journal’, Appendix II). CD had been consulting Jones since July, and had reported an improvement in his health under the rigorous diet prescribed by Jones (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4901.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 27 [or 28 September 1865]</ref>, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4909.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to T. H. Huxley, 4 October [1865]</ref>, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4924.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to W. D. Fox, 25–6 October [1865]</ref> and n. 2).
