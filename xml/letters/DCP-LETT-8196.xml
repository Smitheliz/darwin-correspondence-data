<p>I am very gratified at receiving the Photograph as well as your kind letter, which I should have answered before but the continued wet had crowded so many shooting engagements into the last few days that I had no time and I am now rather done.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I had procured your Photo, somewhere in London, but it is not so good as that you sent me which I think is excellent.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I send mine which I had taken the last time I went to the Levèe;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have none in plain clothes some of which were thought to be better. The beard alters me, though I do not think I am so changed as the “Claimant”.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>But I do not think I should know King if I were to meet him.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I met two years ago the late 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. L<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. of my last ship the Forte, and could not call his name to mind until he told me, when of course I knew him at once.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Would not Sergeant Ballantyne like to hear this.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I am now living in sight of the ruins of the pretty cottage where I was born, and surrounded by land that was my Fathers; and I have managed to buy a “corner of about 40 acres of wood land part of a very old inheritance but I am a tenant of the great Architect M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Salvin who builds the ugliest houses I ever saw, though his own is rather pretty.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>His second son Osgood tells me he knows you well, and I think he is a very nice fellow.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I am my dear Darwin | Yours very sincerely | A. Mellersh</p>
