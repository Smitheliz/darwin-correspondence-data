<p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Burdon Sandersons paper on the leaf currents in Dionoea has set me observing the insectivorous plants, and I wait longingly for your book, that I may see more wonders.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But some of my independant observations are most curious and one which mere accident has revealed is so startling that I hasten to send it to you, even at the risk of it being already known to you.</p>
<p>This afternoon I was hurriedly summoned from my plants and I left a Dionoea uncovered in a hot drawing room exposed to a full glare of sunshine</p>
<p>When I came back in a few hours it seemed doomed, the leaf stalks being much shrunken   Its traps were all open, so I tried to see if its nervous system were dead</p>
<p>I found that irritation of a nerve fibre (and we must I think give them that name) of one side of the traps caused incurvation of the fingers &amp; closure of the flap on the opposite side only!</p>
<p>That is reflex action and as we find reflex action often most marked in certain forms of disease &amp; injury which induce paralysis, it seems to me it occurs in this plant.</p>
<p>For instance, in health tickling the inside of the thigh does not induce elevation of the testicle by contraction of the cremaster muscle,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> save in the infant but after fracture of the spine it nearly always does. My poor dionoea, therefore, was paralysed</p>
<p>From what I have seen I am sure we shall find still greater reason to allow a nervous system for these plants.</p>
<p>I am watching a lot of my mice from whom I removed the tails at birth, and I am coming to the conclusion that the essential use of the tail there is as a recording organ, that is they record in their memories the corners they turn &amp; the height of the holes they pass through by touching them with their tails<ref target="#foot.f4"/>   Is not this queer.</p>
<p>With best regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin &amp; with tender recollections of my visit to Down,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I remain, | Yours ever | Lawson Tait</p>
