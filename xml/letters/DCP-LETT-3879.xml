<p>Permit me to thank you cordially for your most kind letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> For years I have read with interest every scrap which you have written in Periodical &amp; abstracted in M.S. your book on Roses,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; several times I thought I would write to you, but did not know whether you would think me too intrusive. I shall indeed be truly obliged for any information you can supply me on bud-variation or sports.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> When any extra difficult point occurs to me in my present subject (which is a mass of difficulties), I will apply to you; but I will not be unreasonable. It is most true what you say that any one to study well the physiology of the life of plants, ought to have under his eye a multitude of plants. I have endeavoured to do what I can by comparing statements by many writers &amp; observing what I could myself. Unfortunately few have observed like you have done. As you are so kind I will mention one other point on which I am collecting facts, namely the effect produced on the stock by the graft; thus it is <hi rend="underline">said</hi> that the purple-leaved Filbert affects the leaves of the common hazel on which it is grafted (I have just procured a plant to try) so variegated Jessamine is <hi rend="underline">said</hi> to affect its stock.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I want these facts partly to throw light on the marvellous Laburnum Adami—Trifacial oranges &amp;c. That Laburnum case seems one of the strangest in physiology: I have now growing splendid, <hi rend="underline">fertile</hi> yellow Laburnums (with long racemes like the so-called Waterer’s Laburnum) from seed of yellow flowers on the L. adami.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I do so wish I could accept your invitation; I will see in Spring what I can do; but I suffer severely from ill-health of a very peculiar kind, which prevents me from all mental excitement, which is always followed by spasmodic sickness, &amp; I do not think I could stand conversation with you, which to me would be so full of enjoyment. I send a little pamphet on a subject on which I am at work, &amp; on which I shall soon publish some much more striking cases.— These cases show how little we yet know on fertilisation.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>To a man like myself who is compelled to live a solitary life &amp; sees few persons, it is no slight satisfaction to hear that I have been able at all interest by my books, observers like yourself.—</p>
<p>As I shall publish on my present subject, I presume within a year, it will be of no use your sending me the shoots of Peaches &amp; nectarines which you so kindly offer; I have recorded your facts.—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>Permit me again to thank you cordially; I have not often in my life received a kinder letter.— | My dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD had for many years been interested in the origin of the hybrid laburnum, <hi rend="italic">Cytisus Adami</hi>, branches of which had reportedly been found to bear the leaves and flowers of both the parent species (<hi rend="italic">C. purpureus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. laburnum</hi>, the common laburnum) in addition to those of the hybrid form (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vols. 4–6). In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 387–97, CD discussed at length the evidence for and against the different theories that had been advanced to account for the hybrid form, dwelling particularly on the possibility that it was either an ordinary hybrid, formed by seed, or that it was what he called a ‘graft-hybrid’. He cited the observations referred to here in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 388. The analogous case of the trifacial orange is discussed in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 1: 391.</note>

CD also refers to his experiments in 1862 on dimorphism in species of <hi rend="italic">Linum</hi> and trimorphism in <hi rend="italic">Lythrum salicaria</hi>, and to his further experiments with dimorphic species of <hi rend="italic">Primula.</hi> His results from these experiments were given in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7887.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Two forms in species of <hi rend="italic">Linum</hi>’</ref>, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7749.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Three forms of <hi rend="italic">Lythrum salicaria</hi>’</ref>, which were published in 1863 and 1864, respectively, and ‘Illegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic plants’, which was not published until 1868 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2782.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">General index to the Journal of the Linnean Society</hi></ref>, p. vi).</note>
