<p>Comments on ARW’s view of colouring in relation to sexual selection and protection. It is not new to CD. Hopes to discuss subject fully in his "Essay on Man" [<hi rend="italic">Descent</hi>]. As to the problem of brightly coloured females, CD is not satisfied that it is due to males taking over incubation. Admires "value and beauty" of ARW’s generalisations.</p>

<p>I have been greatly interested by your letter, but your view is not new to me.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> If you will look at p. 240 of 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Ed. of Origin you will find it very briefly given with two extreme examples of the Peacock &amp; Black grouse.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> A more general statement is given at p. 101 or at p. 89 of the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Ed., for I have long entertained this view, though I have never had space to develope it.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> But I had not sufficient knowledge to generalize as far as you do about colouring &amp; nesting. In your paper perhaps you will just allude to my scanty remark in the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Ed, because in my Essay upon Man I intend to discuss the whole subject of sexual selection, explaining as I believe it does much with respect to man.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have collected all my old notes &amp; partly written my discussion &amp; it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be flat work for me to give the leading idea as exclusively from you. But as I am sure from your greater knowledge of ornithology &amp; Entomology that you will write a much better discussion than I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>, your paper will be of great use to me.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I must discuss the subject fully in my essay on man. When we met at the Zoolog. Soc. &amp; I asked you about the sexual differences in kingfishers I had this subject in view; as I had when I suggested to Bates the difficulty about gaudy caterpillars which you have so admirably, (as I believe it will prove) explained.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have got one capital case (genus forgotten) of a Mexican bird in which the female has long tailed plumes &amp; which consequently builds a different nest from all her allies.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> With respect to certain female birds being more brightly coloured than the males, &amp; the latter incubating I have gone a little into the subject &amp; cannot say that I am fully satisfied.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I remember mentioning to you the case of Rhynchæa, but its nesting seems unknown.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> In some other cases the difference in brightness seemed to me hardly sufficiently accounted for by the principle of protection.</p>
<p>At the Falkland I’s there is a Carrion hawk in which the female (as I ascertained by dissection) is the brightest coloured, &amp; I doubt whether protection will here apply; but I wrote several months ago to the Falklands to make enquiries<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>The conclusion to which I have been leaning is that in some of these abnormal cases the colour happened to vary in the female alone, &amp; was transmitted to females alone, &amp; that her variations have been selected through the admiration of the male.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>It is a very interesting subject but I shall not be able to go on with it for the next 5 or 6 months, as I am fully employed in correcting dull proof sheets;<ref target="#foot.f12"/> when I return to the work I shall find it much better done by you than I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have succeeded in doing.</p>
<p>With many thanks for your very interesting note | believe me dear Wallace | yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>It is curious, how we hit on the same ideas.—</p>
<p>I have endeavoured and show in my M.S. discussion that nearly the same principles account for young birds <hi rend="underline">not</hi> being gaily coloured, in many cases,—but this is too complex a point for a note.—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>

<p>My dear Wallace</p>
<p>On reading over your letter again &amp; on further reflexion, I do not think (as far as I remember my words) that I expressed myself <hi rend="underline">nearly strongly</hi> enough on the value &amp; beauty of your generalisation, viz that all Birds, in which the female is conspicuously or brightly coloured, build in holes or under domes. I thought that this was the explanation in many, perhaps most cases, but do not think I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. ever have extended my view to your generalisation.— Forgive me troubling you with this. P.S.</p>
