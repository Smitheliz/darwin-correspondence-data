<p>CD was impressed by manner in which species in South America are replaced by closely allied ones, by affinity of species inhabiting islands near S.

                    <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I thank you sincerely for your letter<ref target="#foot.f2"/> &amp; the confidence you repose in me. I have been deeply interested in what you say about your poor wife.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Her expression in the photograph is charming. I can to a certain extent understand what your feelings are, for I am fortunate enough to know what a treasure a wife can be &amp; no one thought is so painful to me as the possibility of surviving her.</p>
<p>As you seem interested about the origin of the “Origin” &amp; I believe do not say so out of mere compliment, I will mention a few points. When I joined the “Beagle” as Naturalist I knew extremely little about Natural History, but I worked hard.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> In South America three classes of facts were brought strongly before my mind: 1<hi rend="superscript">stly</hi> the manner in which closely allied species replace species in going Southward.</p>
<p>2<hi rend="superscript">ndly</hi> the close affinity of the species inhabiting the Islands near to S. America to those proper to the Continent. This struck me profoundly, especially the difference of the species in the adjoining islets in the Galapagos Archipelago.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> 3<hi rend="superscript">rdly</hi> the relation of the living Edentata &amp; Rodentia to the extinct species. I shall never forget my astonishment when I dug out a gigantic piece of armour like that of the living Armadillo.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Reflecting on these facts &amp; collecting analogous ones, it seemed to me probable that allied species were descended from a common parent. But for some years I could not conceive how each form became so excellently adapted to its habits of life. I then began systematically to study domestic productions, &amp; after a time saw clearly that man’s selective power was the most important agent.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I was prepared from having studied the habits of animals to appreciate the struggle for existence, &amp; my work in Geology gave me some idea of the lapse of past time. Therefore when I happened to read “Malthus on population” the idea of Natural selection flashed on me.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Of all the minor points, the last which I appreciated was the importance &amp; cause of the principle of Divergence.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I hope I have not wearied you with this little history of the “Origin”—<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I quite agree with what you say about Kölliker; there is a capital review of him by Huxley in the Number just published of the “Natural History Review”.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> This letter was begun several weeks ago, but I have delayed finishing it from having little strength &amp; other things to do. Will you have the kindness to tell this to Prof. Gegenbaur as an apology for not having thanked him for the honour he has done me in sending me his work. By a strange chance I dissected several months ago the hind foot of a toad &amp; was particularly curious to understand what the additional bones were, &amp; this point I see will now be explained to me.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> As I know from one of the papers which you have sent me that you have attended to Entomostraca it has occurred to me that you might like to have a copy of my Vol. on the Balanidæ, of which I have a spare copy &amp; would with pleasure send it if you wish for it, &amp; will tell me how to forward it.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>With sincere respect | Believe me my dear Sir | yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>

The <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> collections from the Galápagos islands indicated not only that the majority of land birds were endemic to the archipelago as a whole, but also that some were endemic to specific islands. The results of the analyses he made between 1837 and 1859 of the plant and animal collections from the archipelago led CD to accord great importance to the role of geographical isolation in the production of new species (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 107–8; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi></ref>, pp. 254–6, 273–4; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7547.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sulloway 1979</ref> and 1984).

The question of the influence of Malthus on CD has been debated extensively; for an overview of this issue see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4612.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">La Vergata 1985</ref>, pp. 953–8. CD’s reading notebooks indicate that he studied Malthus’s work, and critiques of Malthus’s work, closely; he re-read <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5179.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Malthus 1826</ref> in 1847 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Appendix IV).

            <note xml:id="foot.f9">CD’s principle of divergence was based on the premises that a locality can support more life if it is occupied by a diversity of life-forms, that the varying offspring of each species will strive to occupy as many and as great a diversity of niches as possible, and that natural selection will tend to favour the evolution of new, specialised varieties. He saw these processes as the origin of the branching relationships between species, genera, families, orders, and classes. CD first discussed this principle in the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2134.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 22 August [1857]</ref>, and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2136.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to Asa Gray, 5 September [1857]</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 6); see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, pp. 111–126, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi></ref>, pp. 227–50. For a full definition of the principle of divergence and the background to CD’s formulation of it between November 1854 and 1858, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_989.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Browne 1980</ref>, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6037.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ospovat 1981</ref>, pp. 170–209, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4426.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Kohn 1985</ref>.
