                    <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>

                    <p>I have just read with deep interest your “life of Erasmus Darwin”.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>My conception of the character of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin always made me feel very dissatisfied with his life by Miss Seward<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>In the life I have just read I recognise the faithful, affectionate &amp; benevolent friend I had conceived the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. to be.</p>
<p>The occasion of my writing is to say that I many years ago took copies of four letters written by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin—three of them from from the original letters addressed to my G<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. G<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. father Richard Dixon &amp; one from a copy of a letter to a Son of my G<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. G<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. father.</p>
<p>I enclose a copy of the letter which seems to me likely to be of most interest to you &amp; which my Son has taken for me.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I also write to ask if you have in your searches come across any letters to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin from any members of my family especially from Richard Dixon who died I believe 1797. That Richard Dixon was born at Elston abt. the same time as D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin &amp; on the back of his apprenticeship indentures are the names of</p> 
<figure type="diagram"> 
<p>W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. Alvey Darwin</p>
<p>John Darwin<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Erasmus Darwin</p>
<p>June 10. 1747</p> </figure> 
<p>A few years ago I paid a visit to Elston but found no remains of my family. I went into the ancient chapel in the records of which was the baptism of my Gt. G<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. father. I also went to see Elston Hall &amp; was much interested in seeing the ground laid out &amp; planted by Dr. Darwin.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>While reading this life of yr. Grandfather it occured to me that it is possible Miss Susanna Darwin<ref target="#foot.f6"/> might allude in some letter to her Brother to the Dixons or Sumners—my relatives   if so &amp; if it would not be over burdensome to you I should feel very much obliged if you would let me know of any such allusions, for the slightest would be of interest.</p>
<p>I fear I have intruded myself too long on your attention but the interest I feel in these matters induced me to venture</p>
<p>I am | My dear Sir | sincerely yours | Robert Walker Dixon</p> 
                    <p>P.S. I shall be glad to forward you copies of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin’s other letters if you desire them.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>

                    <p>I should have written to you much sooner but waited for a frank, as Erasmus<ref target="#foot.f9"/> promises at the same time to send you a scrawl,— I wish him to send you a subpœna to Derby, where you well know I shall at any time be very glad to see you or your’s.— I hope you will come next summer &amp; see yr. Cousin Sumner;<ref target="#foot.f10"/> you who are now a gentleman, at large, &amp; not confined at home all the year, as I am, should not neglect your old Elston friends;—if I were Cousin Sumner, I believe I should strike you out of my will for not coming down this last summer!—she expects an annual kiss from you at least;—whether your mouth is drawn on one side or not,—you must mind on which side you approach lest you should kiss her ear. I am glad to find your spirits are so good, as to joke upon yr. infirmity of having yr. mouth drawn a little to one side, my next door neighbour, a young man to you, I suppose not 50 has had just such a seizure, which he is slowly recovering from, you say the only inconvenience you find, is that you cannot now whistle to amuse yourself, &amp; he says all the inconvenience he finds, is, that he cannot blow out his candle, when he goes into bed. If yr. Doctor says you are well, how dare you think to the contrary? The success of the French against a confederacy of kings gives me great pleasure, &amp; I hope they will preserve their liberty, &amp; spread the holy flame of freedom over Europe.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> For my part I go on as usual to practice physic, and to write books,— I sold a work called “The Botanic Garden” for 900£ to Johnson the bookseller near S<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. Paul’s, it is a poem; perhaps you may borrow it from some circulating library; it is in two parts and sold for 1—13—0—<ref target="#foot.f12"/>   I intend to publish another work next in prose wh. will be chiefly on physic, I fear it will not sell so well as the last.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> The worst thing I find now is this d—n’d old age, which creeps slily upon one, like moss upon a tree, and wrinkles one all over like a baked pear.—but I see by your letter that your juvenility will never fail you; you’l laugh on to the last, like Pope Alexander, who died laughing; on seeing his tame monkey steal to bedside, and put on the holy Tiara, the triple crown, wh. denotes him king of kings.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> Now M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Pain says that he thinks a monkey or a bear, or a goose may govern a kingdom as well, &amp; at a much less expense than any being in Christendom, whether idiot or madman, or in his royal senses;<ref target="#foot.f15"/> adieu dear Citizen from thy affectionate equal</p>
                    <p>E. Darwin</p>
                    <p>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin &amp; all here beg to be remembered to you &amp; send compliments to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Dixon.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> Brother John is returned to Carlton, &amp; preaches furiously, he prays as usual, and advises his parish, &amp; makes up differences &amp; advises the poor as he used to do— He’ill hold the Devil a good tugg, I hope yet, for there are few such clergy to be found. I don’t believe amongst the 8000 French parsons, wh. you are now feeding in London, &amp; wh. France has spewed out of her mouth, that you can find one equal to your old playfellow at Carlton Scroop.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> Pray give my comply<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>., to all yr. sons. Mry. Day. is a teacher at M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Ton’s boarding school at Chesterfield, and Susannah is going to be governess in a family near Chesterfield. &amp; seem both very happy in their situations.<ref target="#foot.f18"/></p>
