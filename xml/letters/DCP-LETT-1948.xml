                <div type="transcription">
<p>I thank you heartily for your note &amp; for your promise of more information on Pigs, about which I am very curious.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> By the way Bechstein asserts that the number of incisors varies greatly in domestic pigs:<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I am myself going to collect Pigs jaws (no other part) to see whether he is to be trusted. Have you ever noticed this? I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to confirm Bechstein on your authority.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I had no idea that your Stud Book was so well illustrated;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I suppose you mean me to return the Plates, so I do. But I have been very glad to see them. Just after writing to you,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I found what my memory told me of: viz an article by some apparently well informed person in Quarterly Review (1849 p. 392) who says there is a split of unknown origin in this breed,—one strain having white face tawny sides &amp; upward directed horns; the other a speckled face, generally white line down back, <hi rend="underline">shorter legs</hi> &amp; more horizontal horns.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> In my Book on Variation which is progressing (but Heaven knows what it will turn out) I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to give this case <hi rend="underline">trifling</hi> as it is; for it is so rare to trace commencement of even a sub-breed of a sub-breed;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> &amp; I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to quote your remarks in your note, &amp; will append Author of the “Stud Book on Herefordshire Cattle” Is this correct title? If you can give me any other information about these two families of Herefordshire I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be very <hi rend="underline">grateful</hi>: I suppose you do not believe about <hi rend="underline">short-legs</hi>; but just bear this point in mind.—</p>
<p>What a wonderful collection of Birds you have! I had not the least idea of your richness.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I remember well your case of the geese &amp; shall have to quote it.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> What became of the grandchildren geese? did you continue to breed from them? I have lately been making enquiries in India, where there are flocks of the half-bred-geese habitually kept.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p>One of the subjects which gives me most trouble for my work, is means of distribution in the case of species found on distant islands; I have lately been trying the powers of resistance of seeds to sea-water,—their powers of floating—the number of living seeds in earth &amp; mud &amp;c &amp;c.— Would you render me a little assistance in this line? My walking days are over, never to return. I want to know whether on a wet muddy day, whether birds feet are dirty:<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I am going to send my servant out with some keeper &amp; he shall wash all the partridges feet &amp; save the dirty water!!<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>But I want especially to know whether herons or any waders (we have no ponds hereabouts) or water-birds when suddenly sprung have <hi rend="underline">ever</hi> dirty feet or beaks? I found in 2 large table-spoon full of mud from a little pond from beneath the water 53 plants germinated.—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Do you know when owl or Hawk eats a little bird, how soon it throws up pellet? Can it throw up pellet whilst on wing? How I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to get a collection of pellets &amp; see whether they contained any seeds capable of germination. Could your gamekeepers find a roosting place, &amp; collect a lot for me?—</p>
<p>Lastly (if you are not sick of my enquiries) have you ever examined the stomachs of dace &amp; other white fish? Do they ever eat seeds; I know it is good to bait a place with grains. For like the house which Jack built, a heron might eat a fish with seed of water plant &amp; then fly to another pond.</p>
<p>I have been trying for a year with no success to get some dace &amp;c. Have you any &amp; could you catch some in net. &amp; order your kitchen maid to clean them, &amp; you c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. send me the whole stomach &amp; I would sow the contents on burnt earth with every proper precaution. If ever your goodnature sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. lead you to send me any such rubbish; it might be put in bladder or tin foil &amp; sent by Post, &amp; if you will not think me very impertinent I could repay you the shilling or two for postage; as the rubbish w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. thus come much quicker &amp; cheaper to me.</p>
<p>Do you mean to collect cats’ skeletons: Sir C. Lyell has odd Persian &amp; I have <hi rend="underline">heard</hi> of another odd cat &amp; I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. request their carcases to be sent to you, if you cared about them. But I fancy cats are much mixed beings.—</p>
<p>Well I have put your words, that you like hearing from old naturalist friends, to a severe test. So forgive me &amp; believe me, | Your’s most truly | Ch. Darwin</p>
