<p>I am grieved to hear of the death of my old and kind friend, though I knew that it could not be long delayed, and that it was a happy thing that his life should not have been prolonged, as I suppose that his mind would inevitably have suffered. I am glad that Lady Lyell has been saved this terrible blow.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> His death makes me think of the time when I first saw him, and how full of sympathy and interest he was about what I could tell him of Coral reefs and South America.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I think that this sympathy with the work of every other naturalist was one of the finest features of his character. How completely he revolutionised Geology; for I can remember something of pre-Lyellian days.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I never forget that almost every thing which I have done in science I owe to the study of his great works. Well he has had a grand and happy career, and no one ever worked with truer zeal in a noble cause. It seems strange to me, that I shall never again sit with him and Lady Lyell at their breakfast.— I am very much obliged to you for having so kindly written to me.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Pray give our kindest remembrances to Miss Lyell,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> and I hope that she has not suffered much in health from fatigue and anxiety.</p>
<p>Believe me, my dear Miss Buckley, | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin</p>
