<p>It is with much regret, that I feel myself compelled, from the state of my health to resign the office of one of your secretaries. The only apology I can offer, for not having taken this step before the day of the Anniversary,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> which probably would have been more convenient, is, that I did not at that time anticipate its necessity, and the regret I felt at giving up so very honourable a post led me to defer it, as long as I was able.— Should there be any delay in filling my place, I shall be happy to attend in it, as often as my health permits</p>
<p>I have the honour to remain | Gentlemen | Your obedient servant | Charles Darwin<ref target="#foot.f3"/> To the President and Council | of the Geological Society.</p>
