<p>I have been some time in search of a Tutor for my Son Charles, who if nothing better offers I intend for the Church, &amp; as you are now at the seat of learning I take the liberty, which I know you will excuse, of asking if you can assist me in the matter; &amp; I do so, not only because I feel assured you will be happy to do anything you can for me either in this or any other way, but because I have that confidence in your good Judgment that would make me better satisfied by your recommendation of such a Person than by that of almost any Man I know.</p>
<p>I must however tell you that, (as you already know,) I have a large Family &amp; am a poor Man, &amp; therefore cannot afford to pay extravagantly for such a Person—&amp; on this acc<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. I have already refused two offers—the one requiring £200 per Annum &amp; the other 150 with extras which with travelling expences, Pocket Money &amp; Clothes would make the total expense not much less than 250—&amp; I am told that perfectly competent Tutors &amp; eligible Situations are to be met with for from 100 to 130—which would suit my Finances much better— Charles is I think more than 17 Years of Age but both in appearance &amp; manner is much less— He is a very honorable, &amp; well disposed Boy &amp; has always maintain’d a good Character &amp; a good place at Rugby, &amp; I removed him a few Month’s ago because, though he was doing well, his younger Brother<ref target="#foot.f2"/> who is a quicker Boy, having got three removes in one Year, got into the same Form with him, &amp; I did not like to expose him to the chance of being pass’d by his Junior; an event which might have created a Jealousy or ill blood between them which I thought it better for both should be avoided— And though the younger Boy has the greater Facility in learning the elder I believe has quite as good common sense &amp; will probably make as good &amp; as useful a Man. Whether he is now qualified to commence his Career at the University or not I am not able to say—but he is so Boyish both in manner &amp; appearance that I think it will be for his advantage to pass another Year at least with a good Tutor, &amp; as I feel more inclined to send him to Cambridge than to Oxford I have a further reason for asking your assistance. I need not tell you that Boys at home <hi rend="underline">in the Country</hi> will not pay much attention to their Books &amp; I am therefore very anxious to find a good Tutor for him as soon as possible; &amp; I think if the Tutor had two or three other Boys who were pursuing the same studies &amp; were nearly of the same Age it would be a recommendation.—</p>
<p>I suppose you receive frequent accounts from your own Family of whom I shall therefore say no more than that I believe they are all well— Your Sister Katharine was here two days ago &amp; I narrowly miss’d seeing your Father Yesterday at the Lyth.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I am almost sorry you are so well &amp; I hope so agreeably employ’d at Cambridge for I fear there is now no chance of my having an opportunity this Winter of renewing my instructions to you in the <hi rend="underline">Science</hi> of Shooting—&amp; I am getting so old &amp; so bad on my Legs that I fear I shall not be able much longer to attend to or to <hi rend="underline">instruct you</hi>, &amp; you really were so promising a Pupil that I was rather proud of you.— We are all well &amp; all unite in kind regards to you with | Yours most sincerely | W<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>.
