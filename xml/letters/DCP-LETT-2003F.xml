<p>You need not have sent me to School Yesterday because today M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. P Says I am to stop up in the sick room all day.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Last night I left all my goodies in the sick room so I thought of course they would all be safe but this morning low and behold they are all gone except some ginger Bread and a little bit of cake. They took the letter into M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. P. last night.</p>
<p>I like the Book I am reading now now very much   it is called Ben Sylvester’s word,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> it is all about robbers &amp; murdering that is to say a good deal about them. When once I get in steady work again, the time will soon fly. We have no chapel now and on Sunday some boys are going to Westminster Abbey and goodness knows where, all sorts of Churchs. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Morrey gave me a great peice of Toffey and I never eat a bit of it myself, and I only had one peice of ginger Bread.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I forgot both the pencills and the nibbs for my pens, so I shall have to buy some. I forgot to put to put away my painting things so I must tell you where to put them.</p>
<p>Pencil in pencil case in box</p>
<p>compass in compass case in ditto</p>
<p>pen and nibbs ditto</p>
<p>gold paint ditto</p>
<p>paintbox in the setting board cupboard on the middle shelf that is just below the setting boards.</p>
<p>pallate ditto</p>
<p>mug ditto</p>
<p>painting hankerchief ditto.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallCaps">LOCK UP THE BOOK</hi></p>
<p>I expect you have put my things in the wrong places but now you will be able to put them right. I wish I had stoped.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I could not get an inside place in an omnibus so I had a cold drive. I got up this morning with a bit of a headache but it soon went of.</p>
<p>The first bit of time will pass awfully slow. I have begun those thick trowsers, so I dont know what to say about flannel draws   Mama will settle that   I hope shall come to London to meet H. Hemmings.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I suppose Brooks came home very late last night.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Will you or Mama <hi rend="underline">write</hi> to me <hi rend="underline">very soon</hi></p>
<p>Good bye   I remain | your affec son | G H Darwin</p>
<p>Nucklebones come from sheep’s ankles   I suppose all four legs   I have no pen</p>
