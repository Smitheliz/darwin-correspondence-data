<p>Your clothes have been found &amp; sent off.— We have received your nice Monday letter.— I am glad to hear about rifle-club: I think it very proper that every man sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. learn the use of arms to defend himself or country at a crisis.</p>
<p>You will have to reflect soon &amp; seriously about your summer-plans.— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like you to have one pleasure excursion. Indeed we sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like you to have no end of pleasure; if that was not a bad beginning for one who must work, or be a poor man all his life.— In 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. place there is Ilkley in July.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Secondly Aunt Catherine has just written to ask whether you would like to go with her in middle of June to <hi rend="underline">north</hi> of Scotland, for about 5 weeks.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Mary Parker will probably be of party.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> They will stay chiefly at a few different places, &amp; not travel very much. This tour w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have advantage of not costing you hardly anything. It would not do to tell Aunt Catherine that you would go, &amp; then change. Thirdly, there is your Swiss Tour: I presume that this would be practicable for two young men even in war-time.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> But it would cost money. It would never do to have <hi rend="underline">both</hi> tours &amp; Ilkley; for you would do nothing all summer.— But whether you could afford the Swiss Tour, I know not: if you worked pretty hard I would help you a little with cash.— Fourthly, there is the suggestion of your reading at the Lakes; the country is charming; &amp; if you thought you really could work, I would <hi rend="underline">gladly</hi> pay the tutor’s fee (What is it?) &amp; you could come to us at Ilkley at close. No doubt that reading with Tutor in first vacation would get you splendidly on.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Can you form any opinion whether your Tutor thinks you have a turn for mathematicks? Even if you were not able to take high degree, a course of mathematicks well followed up, must be an admirable training.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Consider well; &amp; then come <hi rend="underline">soon</hi> to some decision.— You are lad of gumption &amp; will choose well &amp; honestly.—</p>
<p>I have sent 6 first chapters to Printer, &amp; hope to have finished early in July, if health permits.—</p>
<p>I have invented splendid game at Billiard; put 2 coloured balls on Table &amp; play for canons<ref target="#foot.f8"/> only—misses to count 1—spot the coloured balls when accidentally pocketed—play next time with white balls when pocketed up or down, out of Balk semicircle.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Dated on the assumption that William had just returned to Cambridge for the new university term. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin’s</ref> diary records that William left Down on 2 May 1859, a Monday. This was probably the same Monday as the ‘nice Monday letter’ referred to by CD. The following Thursday was 5 May.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD planned to go with his family to a water-cure establishment at Ilkley, near Otley, Yorkshire, in July, but because he was so occupied with getting <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> ready for the press, he did not go there until October. In July he briefly visited Moor Park hydropathic establishment (‘Journal’; Appendix II).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Emily <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1212.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Catherine Darwin</ref> was CD’s younger sister. William had accompanied her on a former tour in the summer of 1858 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-2266.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to W. E. Darwin, [26 May 1858]</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Mary Susan Parker was William’s cousin, aged 23, and so about three years older than William. She was the daughter of Marianne and Henry Parker.</note>

He was an exceedingly good walker, and he loved the English lake-country’ (<hi rend="italic">Biographical register of</hi> <hi rend="italic">Christ’s College, 1505–1905</hi> 2: 500–1). In a letter to William written late in May 1859, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1218.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Emma Darwin</ref> stated: ‘Your father &amp; I think it will not be worth while your joining Aunt Cath. for a fortnight &amp; you will have a most pleasant time with the Tutor at the lakes. Your father will write to you soon. It is puzzling to know what to do about this jolly tutor who does not seem to be over studious. He must have taken a fancy to you I think.’ (DAR 210.6). William decided to read for his examinations in the Lake District: the fee for Wolstenholme’s tutorials was entered in CD’s Account book (Down House MS) on 15 September 1859.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">William passed the Mathematical (Honours) Tripos in June 1861. A printed report of the results of the examination is in DAR 210.6.</note>
