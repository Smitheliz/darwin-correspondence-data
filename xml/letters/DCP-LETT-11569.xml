                    <p>My friend D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Neumayr of Vienna has asked me to forward to you the accompanying paper, which he hopes may offer some observations not unworthy of your interest.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
                    <p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Neumayr is still carrying on, under the auspices of the University of Vienna, his researches on the geology of the Turkish Empire—but his work has of course been somewhat interrupted of late. He has now just returned from his wedding-tour in the North of Italy;— he has married the daughter of his old friend and teacher Prof. Suess.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>Your kind interest in myself and my studies—the sense of which affords me the strongest incentive and encouragement to labour—emboldens me to trouble you for a moment, with a statement of my own affairs. My class is now transferred to this building, and next year I hope to commence a course of <hi rend="underline">practical instruction</hi> in geology in illustration of the lectures. Prof. Huxley has powerfully aided me in realizing this object of my ambition for a long time past.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>I am also about to take the same important step in life that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Neumayr has, and believe my future wife is calculated by education and taste to sympathize with and aid me in my studies.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I know that you will pardon this reference to my own prospects and hopes; and I hope that the partial recovery of health of which you spoke to me as having taken place in your own case, and in which we all so greatly rejoiced, has continued—and that you are able to work under less adverse conditions than formerly.</p> <p>Remembering all your kind sympathy and friendly encouragement, | Believe me to remain, | Yours very dutifully, | John W. Judd</p>
