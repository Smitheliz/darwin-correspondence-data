<p>Having now reached the last Chapter of the volume, for which I am indebted to your kindness, I may fairly speak of the interest with which I have read it throughout.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> It perhaps adds somewhat less than I expected, to the evidence of the derivation of Man; but this you allude to yourself in the last sentence of the volume;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; I am much disposed to think with you, that the confirmation was hardly needed.</p>
<p>Some detached comments I may make, when I have the pleasure of seeing you.</p>
<p>I have myself had a somewhat busy autumn of travel; going round the North Cape,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> under the light of the midnight sun, &amp; 200 miles beyond, to the borders of Russian Lapland—reaching 71"30 of Latitude. Since that time I have been to Lord Rosse’s great Reflectors in Ireland,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> and still-more lately, have passed three weeks in the delicious Island of Madeira, warming myself there after the Arctic Seas: This is tolerable work for a gentleman in his 85<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year.</p>
<p>Let me see you when you come to Town. Ever my dear Charles, your’s | affec<hi rend="superscript">ly</hi> | H Holland</p>
