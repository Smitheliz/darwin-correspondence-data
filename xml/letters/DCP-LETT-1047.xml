<p>CD understands that JFR cannot lend him the volumes [of <hi rend="italic">Trans. Agric. &amp; Hortic. Soc. India</hi>] at present. Thanks for offer to inform him of other works on the breeds of animals in India.</p> 
            <p>CD fears his belonging to the new club [Philosophical Club of the Royal Society] would be useless, since he is seldom able to dine out.</p>

<p>The carrier set off before your note arrived yesterday, so that he will have called at your house. Of course it is out of the question your lending me at present the book<ref target="#foot.f2"/> (and very glad I am to hear of the Committee on the cotton)<ref target="#foot.f3"/> and I am greatly indebted to your kindness in promising it me at some future time. I will wait till I hear; and of course 6 or 9 months hence will do equally well for me. Your offer is a most valuable one to inform me of any other works on the breeds of animals in India and such subjects, to which I have long been attending. I believe it was in your Productions Resources<ref target="#foot.f4"/> that I first heard of the Agricult. Soc. Transactions.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I fear it would be useless my belonging to your new Club,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> as I am so seldom able to dine out anywhere and I presume your dinners are your efficient meetings, but otherwise I should esteem it a very great honour and undoubted pleasure to be enrolled as one of so capital a list of names. All I have heard of it, makes me envious of those who have had the good fortune to be elected.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
