                    <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
<p>I am much obliged for your letter of Oct. 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. from Celebes received a few days ago:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> in a laborious undertaking sympathy is a valuable &amp; real encouragement. By your letter &amp; even still more by your paper in Annals, a year or more ago,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I can plainly see that we have thought much alike &amp; to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions. In regard to the Paper in Annals, I agree to the truth of almost every word of your paper; &amp; I daresay that you will agree with me that it is very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty closely with any theoretical paper; for it is lamentable how each man draws his own different conclusions from the very same fact.—</p>
<p>This summer will make the 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year (!) since I opened my first-note-book, on the question how &amp; in what way do species &amp; varieties differ from each other.— I am now preparing my work for publication, but I find the subject so very large, that though I have written many chapters, I do not suppose I shall go to press for two years.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have never heard how long you intend staying in the Malay archipelago; I wish I might profit by the publication of your Travels there before my work appears, for no doubt you will reap a large harvest of facts.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have acted already in accordance with your advice of keeping domestic varieties &amp; those appearing in a state of nature, distinct; but I have sometimes doubted of the wisdom of this, &amp; therefore I am glad to be backed by your opinion.— I must confess, however, I rather doubt the truth of the now very prevalent doctrine of all our domestic animals having descended from several wild stocks; though I do not doubt that it is so in some cases.— I think there is rather better evidence on the sterility of Hybrid animals that you seem to admit: &amp; in regard to Plants the collection of carefully recorded facts by Kölreuter &amp; Gærtner, (&amp; Herbert) is <hi rend="underline">enormous</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I most entirely agree with you on the little effects of “climatal conditions”, which one sees referred to ad nauseam in all Books; I suppose some very little effect must be attributed to such influences, but I fully believe that they are very slight.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> It is really <hi rend="underline">impossible</hi> to explain my views in the compass of a letter on the causes &amp; means of variation in a state of nature; but I have slowly adopted a distinct &amp; tangible idea.— Whether true or false others must judge; for the firmest conviction of the truth of a doctrine by its author, seems, alas, not to be slightest guarantee of truth.—</p>
<p>I have been rather disappointed at my results in the Poultry line; but if you sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. after receiving this stumble on any curious domestic breed, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be very glad to have it;<ref target="#foot.f8"/> but I can plainly see that this result will not be at all worth the trouble which I have taken.— The case is different with the domestic Pigeons; from its study I have learned much.— The Rajah has sent me some of his Pigeons &amp; Fowls &amp; <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Cats</hi> skins from interior of Borneo, &amp; from Singapore.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>Can you tell me positively that Black Jaguars or Leopards are believed generally or always to pair with Black?<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I do not think colour of offspring good evidence.— Is the case of parrots fed on fat of fish turning colour, mentioned in your Travels?<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I remember case of Parrot with, (<hi rend="underline">I think</hi>,) poison from some Toad put into hollow whence primaries had been removed.</p>
<p>One of the subjects on which I have been experimentising &amp; which cost me much trouble, is the means of distribution of all organic beings found on oceanic islands; &amp; any facts on this subject would be most gratefully received: Land-Molluscs are a great perplexity to me.—</p>
<p>This is a very dull letter, but I am a good deal out of health; &amp; am writing this, not from my home, as dated, but from a water-cure establishment.</p>
<p>With most sincere good wishes for your success in every way I remain | My dear Sir | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
