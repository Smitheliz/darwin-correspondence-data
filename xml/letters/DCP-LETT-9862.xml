<p>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Litchfield,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> to whom I happened to mention that I had addressed a letter to you at Beckenham, has been good enough to send me word (after seeing you) that you were almost sure you had not received anything from me, adding your proper address in case I wished to write again. I trouble you accordingly with this note, to explain that what I sent was not a letter but a printed prospectus of the projected psychological and philosophical journal ‘Mind’, without any indication from whom it came. Though I can hardly doubt that you received the paper in due course, I will make sure and enclose another copy.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Perhaps too you will let me take the opportunity of adding that the project is one in which I venture to hope you may take some interest. It is being started with a strong sense of the difficulties to be surmounted before such a journal can be established, but also not without some hope that they may be overcome. To secure high-class work, provision has been made for the regular payment of contributors at an adequate rate, and there is already a good prospect of co-operation from the foremost workers, both English &amp; foreign, on the wide field of Mind. Being charged with the conduct of the journal, I would fain hope that you also may from time to time proffer some assistance. Any notes by you on points of psychological interest would always be most welcome, and possibly you may be induced to make such more readily when you know of a journal at all times open to receive them.</p>
<p>I am, with great respect, | Yours truly | G Croom Robertson <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
