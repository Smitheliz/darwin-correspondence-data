                    <p>Many thanks for Pfeffers two letters; the first shows a very nice spirit but is very obscure; the second one I can understand nearly all of   I am extremely glad he believes in the sensitive tips.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Also that he disagrees with Wiesner about the way external conditions act.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I think he must have forgotten how impossible it is to discover from his works that he (Pfeffer) agrees with us.</p>
                    <p>I have had a pleasant letter from Elfving wanting very much to know what we think of Wiesner. Elfving says he always felt doubtful about the sensitiveness of tips to gravity or of tips of cotyls to light. He thinks what Wiesner says about light generally is “pure bosh” and shows him to be as Sachs says “Ein Esel”<ref target="#foot.f4"/>   I shall be very glad to get to work on the antiWiesner experiments. I send back the translation of Pfeffer N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 2 &amp; have the translation safe. I will send you Elfvings letter   I havn’t got it with me just now.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>I am rather astonished at Sir John’s letter as I never suggested to him as he says that the Feganites might rent it.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> They have evidently got on his soft side by offering £10 instead of £6.</p>
<p>The fishing has been no good either floods or gales of wind up stream so that you cant throw a fly</p>
                    <p>I shall certainly be back on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. I wrote a letter to Bessy at Lurgan<ref target="#foot.f7"/> which I am afraid was too late   I thought she wouldn’t start in that gale.</p>
                    <p>I think the pitcher with roots will be very nice to microscope<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
                    <p>I have had all my abstracts for the Jahresbericht translated by a German lady in London recommended by Williams &amp; Norgate<ref target="#foot.f9"/> | Yr affec | F D</p>
