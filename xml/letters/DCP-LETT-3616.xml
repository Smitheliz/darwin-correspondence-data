<p>I am glad you got my tin box with the crammed contents, which I did not know how to send otherwise.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I thank you very much for your kind introduction to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Moore.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I write to him by this Mail, and will send to him the Fossils much increased by new findings, in July; among others huge Ammonitidæ.</p>
<p>I have also written to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Rupert Jones about getting my whole collections of Tertiary, Sec<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> and Palæozoic fossils described and figured.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I want to find some one or more who would undertake the service. The Parliament here have in addition to the 2000£ I had before from N.S.W and Victoria, put me into a pension of £<hi rend="italic">[</hi>200<hi rend="italic">]</hi> per an. and also propose this year to give me 5000£ in addition for my past and <hi rend="underline">future</hi> services, if I will write a book for them containing all I know about the Geology of these parts.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> at the same time the Radical Members are hoping here to cut down all <hi rend="underline">State Aid</hi> to the Clergy. I may, perhaps, therefore be not able to do what I would in the money way—but I doubt not I should be able to make some remuneration for the Palæontological work I require. Can you assist M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jones in telling me what it is best to do. I have <hi rend="underline">thousands</hi> of fossils—of which <hi rend="underline">hundreds</hi> are distinct species. I can work up M’Coy’s description of those I sent to Cambridge by re-printing his paper.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> And as the book is for the Colony, I intend to have <hi rend="underline">figured</hi> every Colonial fossil I can get—if I find the means.</p>
<p>I am sorry you broke the supposed Cirripede.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> But I have myself serious doubts now, if it was such. I never recognised such a structure in the wings of Pecten or Monotis:—but I begin to think it belonged to one or other. Mr. Moore will have another and then you can determine it.</p>
<p>It was the .... … line of dots which partly induced me to think the thing was a valve of a Cirripede.</p>
<p>I will try and get you some native Comb.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I have applied to some persons on whom I can rely, with respect to the Gardenias. They grow here—but <hi rend="underline">not</hi> in gardens: so there is a difficulty.— Last year the Eucalypti did not seed much— this year the seeds are forming abundantly. We have had a mild dry autumn and thus far winter. Perhaps moisture has something to do with it. For the ants are as usual every where at all times up and down.</p>
<p>Every now &amp; then I am hearing of people who find <hi rend="underline">trees</hi> <hi rend="underline">partly</hi> living or recent partly converted into stone. I〈s〉 that a fact known out of 〈Aus〉tralia? It might account for stone trees lying on the surface of our plains—without calling in the aid of a post mortem silicification.</p>
<p>I hope you will soon recover your health and strength. ‘<hi rend="underline">Serus in cælum redeas</hi>”.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have also been ill of late, but I effected a partial cure by taking a hammer and walking up and down the railway lines, examining sections, in <hi rend="italic">[illeg]</hi> and Illawarra. I am going next week to Mount <hi rend="italic">[illeg]</hi>, the top of wh. you saw when you went to Bathurst.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Clarke, seeking someone to describe his important collection of fossils from Wollumbilla Creek in Queensland, had asked CD whether he knew the geologist Charles Moore, or whether there was anyone else he could recommend to undertake the description of his entire collection of Australasian fossils (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3401.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from W. B. Clarke, 21 January 1862</ref>).</note>

Following a campaign by Clarke’s friends in 1860–1, the legislative council of New South Wales appointed a committee to examine his entitlement to further recognition for his services in developing the mineral resources of the colony; the committee’s report was positive, and he was granted an allowance of £200 per annum in 1861. In May 1862, a deputation to the Colonial Secretary, <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1097.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Cowper</ref>, urged that Clarke be presented with a sum in acknowledgment of his services, that would allow him to publish the results of his work in England. However, while £5000 was placed on the estimates, that amount was reduced to £3000 when the matter was brought before the legislative council (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 67–8).</note>
