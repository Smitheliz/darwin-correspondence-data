<p>Thanks RO for his note on <hi rend="italic">Conchoderma hunteri</hi> [see <hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> 1: 153].</p> 
            <p>Has been very unwell; has lost four-fifths of his time. Will go to Malvern to try the water-cure for his vomiting, which regular doctors cannot cure.</p>
            <p>Has done some pretty homological work with cirripedes.</p>

<p>I am very obliged for your note &amp; the C. Hunteri:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> the stupid Carrier forgot to call on Thursday, as I ordered him.— He will come on Monday to the College &amp; he will, also, have to call at the Geolog. Soc, which I mention in case of your having sent the specimens there, expecting my attendance at the Anniversary.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have been prevented by being as usual unwell. I have lost for the last 4 or 5 months at least <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>4</mn><mn>5</mn></mfrac></math></formula> of my time, &amp; I have resolved to go this early summer &amp; spend two months at Malvern &amp; see whether there is any truth in Gully &amp; the water cure: regular Doctors cannot check my incessant vomiting at all.— It will cause a sad delay in my Barnacle work, but if once half-well I c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> do more in 6 months than I now do in two years.—</p>
<p>I am quite delighted to hear how effectually you have done Sulivan’s work; I hope you will be rewarded by some treasures.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I had already ordered your book on Limbs:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> on a very <hi rend="doubleUnderline">small</hi> scale I have had some pretty homological work with the Cirripedia &amp; now know certainly what the peduncle &amp; shell is.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Yours most sincerely | C. Darwin</p>
<p>I never heard anything so astounding as the Log-Book of your H.M.S. Diddleus.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>

Sulivan had returned to the Falkland Islands in a private capacity in 1848 after a short period in England.

In subsequent months he became the expert to whom the Admiralty sent all reports of sightings of sea-serpents (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6119.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">R. S.
