<p>I have got the Insectivorous Plants, both parts, and thank you very much   I should have answered your kind letter sooner, if I had not written to Mr Koch about it. Of course the book must be translated, no doubt about that; and I shall be happy to do it, if you kindly allow it   It will then be the first volume of the botanical section of the complete edition.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I have nearly done the “Journal”, and the delight I felt in reading it amply repaid the trouble I had in translating it.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Together with the Insectivorous Plants a new edition of the Origin is wanted   As the work is stereotyped, I suppose you will have nothing to add<ref target="#foot.f3"/>   To complete the history of the theory, as far as yourself are concerned, we intend to give the paper you published in the Linnean Proceedings, Vol III.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Although I am pretty well now, yet I suffer too often from colds and (probably) nervous shortwindedness. Change of air does me always good, and so I shall go to Ems as soon as our summer term is over, to drink the water there and rest a little;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> in September I intend to go south-ward with my wife and the two eldest daughters, to avoid the transitional months which are always trying to me<ref target="#foot.f6"/>   I <hi rend="underline">hope</hi> to be able to do it; but everything depends on circumstances. So, most likely, I shall have to do the Insectivorous Plants before I go. When will they be published in England? Probably not before October. As the book has been asked for already, we must not be late.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I see, you are preparing a revised edition of the Variation under Domestication. When will it come out? Not before next year or later.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>With grateful compliments I am | Yours ever sincerely | J. Victor Carus</p>
