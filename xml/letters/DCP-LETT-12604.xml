<p>I had no intention to make you to write to me, or expectation of your doing so; but your note has been so far “cheerier” to me than mine could have been to you, that I must &amp; will write again.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I saw your motive for not alluding to natural selection &amp; quite agreed in my mind in its wisdom.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But at the same time it occurred to me that you might be giving it up, &amp; that anyhow you could not safely allude to it, without various ‘providos’ too long to give in a Lecture. If I think continuously on some half-dozen structures of which we can at present see no uses, I can persuade myself that natural selection is of quite subordinate importance. On the other hand when I reflect on the innumerable structures, especially in plants, which 20 years ago would have been called simply ‘morphological’ &amp; useless, &amp; which are now known to be highly important, I can persuade myself that every structure may have been developed through natural selection.— It is really curious how many out of a list of Structures which <hi rend="underline">Bronn</hi> <hi rend="underline">enumerated</hi>, as not possibly due to natural selection because of no functional importance, can now be shown to be highly important.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Lobed leaves was, I believe, one case &amp; only 2 or 3 days ago, Frank showed me how they act in a manner quite sufficiently important to account for the lobing of any large leaf.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>

America</hi>.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> See how important in another way this conclusion is; for no one can doubt that</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Huxley had not referred to natural selection in his article on ‘The coming of age of the Origin of Species’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10800.xml">T. H. Huxley 1880c</ref>). He had initially had reservations about the mechanism of natural selection, but consistently defended CD’s evolutionary views (see, for example, <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4015.xml">[T. H.

The list of structures has not been located in Bronn’s work. It is possible this was a list sent by Bronn at the time he was translating <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> into German.</note>

Pallas had made this claim in his ‘Mémoire sur la variation des animaux’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6162.xml">Pallas 1780</ref>). ‘Paflasian’ is a mistake for ‘Pallasian’.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">CD was possibly responding to criticisms of the theory of natural selection  made by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_8693.xml">Charles Elam</ref> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-12603.xml">letter from T. H. Huxley, 10 May 1880</ref> and n. 4).</note>
