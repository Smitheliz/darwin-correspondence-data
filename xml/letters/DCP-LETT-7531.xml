            <p>He has homologised the face muscles of cetaceans and man. Although the former do not show expression, the nose and upper lip muscles are highly developed.</p>

<p>I have written to the College inquiring if your volume had been left there or returned to Murray.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> As yet no answer has come to hand. Doubtless it is all right, as M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ford<ref target="#foot.f2"/> the Hall Porter is attentive to me in such matters.</p>
<p>I smile when you mention any volume of yours giving me trouble.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Far from that, it is a source of intense pleasure that you should think me worthy of remembrance.</p>
<p>Some two years ago, I know you were studying the physiology of the facial muscles as exponent of physiognomy, and very likely you have much to say of this and kindred subjects in your “Descent of Man”.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I shall peruse it thoughtfully and not fail to communicate my impressions.</p>
<p>I do not know whether I have mentioned to you that in Cetaceous animals, certainly void of expression or much change of countenance, the facial muscles are greatly developed. These however, I have homologised with the same in man, especially noting great development of those of the nose and upper lip. Though mobility of the skin and superficial parts is reduced to a minimum, functionally as respects the apparatus of the blow hole action must be frequent and great.</p>
<p>Extra copies for distribution have not yet come to hand but in the last No. of the Linn. Journ. X.V. I have illustrated in part what I above speak of—which may interest you.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Driven from my post and literally left to starve for the last 6 months by those the outer world believes my friends, it is no wonder that for the moment I cannot recall to memory what I formerly stated to you concerning the Macaques.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I am not inclined, however, to put much faith in Sutton’s judgement where critical acumen as to species is at stake.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>Having but lately, so to speak taken refuge, here, with my old and true friend D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Millar<ref target="#foot.f8"/> my notes and memoranda are not handily got at but I will take an early opportunity of rummaging out what facts I have got in reply to your question.</p>
<p>With many thanks for your Volume, | I am with Sincere respect | truly yours | James Murie</p>
