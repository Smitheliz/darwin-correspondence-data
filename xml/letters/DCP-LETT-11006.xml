<p>I have told the H’emperor that it is impossible.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>I should have told you before of K.C.S.I. but as I knew you kindly would excuse me, I delayed.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>As Huxley will tell you, I was taken completely by surprize at R.S. by receiving a letter from L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Salisbury informing me that he had taken a liberty with my name, proposed it to the Queen for K.C.S.I. &amp; that I was virtually appointed!<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It went on to imply that as I was not in the Indian Service it was somewhat irregular, but that my Himalayan work alone “entitled me technically &amp; substantially to the rank”— It added a little about my beneficent exertions for India<ref target="#foot.f4"/>—&amp; was altogether a very “pretty letter”— Huxley told me that I could not refuse if I would, &amp; on recovering my senses I could not but see that both the compliment &amp; manner of paying it were the highest &amp; most gracious that could be. I have since heard that the Cabinet discussed the thing—that they could not longer allow my services to pass unrecognized, there was no K.C.B. vacant, &amp; as I had refused K.C.M.G. it would be risky to ask me to accept anything else;<ref target="#foot.f5"/> so they strained a point to give me K.C.S.I. &amp; in the handsomest manner gave it, <hi rend="underline">solely</hi> for India work.</p>
<p>I had always regarded the Star of India as the most honable of all such distinctions— it is very limited, (to 60. K.C.S.I<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>) is never, like K.C.B, given by court favor or on personal considerations, &amp; it has a flavor of hard work under difficulties, of obstacles overcome, &amp; of brilliant deeds, that is very attractive. Assuredly I would rather go down to posterity as one of the “Stars of India”, than as of any other dignity whatever that the Crown can offer. Of course it pales before P.R.S.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> but then they cannot clash. I do not know whether I told you some 5 years ago application was made to the D. of Argyll to give it me,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> on hearing of which I wrote to him begging him not, as I thought so rare an honor should be confined to actual Indian servants— He answered that he would have given it me, but implied that the Statutes of the Order forbade it! so I never thought any thing more of the matter.</p>
<p>It is as you say a “peculiar” honor &amp; I may well be proud of it &amp; of the way it came.</p>
<p>Is this not a jolly strain of self gratulation &amp; glorification?</p>
<p>Harriet will be married on 23 &amp; I sail on 28 from Liverpool. What commissions have you for Niagara &amp; Colorado? that Hayden Strachey &amp; I can execute.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
