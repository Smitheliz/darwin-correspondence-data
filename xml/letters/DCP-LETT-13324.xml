<p>We have been paying M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich a little visit, &amp; he has often spoken of you &amp; I think he enjoyed much your &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Huxley’s visit here.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But my object in writing now is to tell you something, which I am very doubtful whether it is worth while for you to hear, because it is uncertain.— My brother Erasmus has left me half his fortune, which is very considerable.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Therefore I thought myself bound to tell M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rich of this, stating the large amount, as far as the executors as yet know it roughly. I then added that my wife &amp; self thought that under these new circumstances he was <hi rend="doubleUnderline">most</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">fully</hi> justified in altering his will, &amp; leaving his property in some other way.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I begged him to take a week to consider what I had told him &amp; then by letter to inform me of the result.— But he would not, however, hardly allow me to finish what I had to say, &amp; expressed a firm determination not to alter his will, adding that I had five sons to provide for. After a short pause he implied, (but unfortunately he here became very confused &amp; forgot a word, which on subsequent reflexion, I think was probably “reversionary”.) anyhow he implied that there was a chance, whether good or bad I know not, of his becoming possessed of some other property, &amp; he finished by saying distinctly “I will bequeath this to Huxley”. What the amount may be, (I believe not large)— what the chance may be, God only knows; &amp; one cannot cross examine a man about his will.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> He did not bind me to secrecy, so I think I am justified in telling you what passed, but whether it is wicked on my part to send so vague a story, I am not at all sure; but as a general rule it is best to tell everything.— As I know that you hate writing letters do not trouble yourself to answer this. From what I have seen in a sort of summary in the Times, I am anxious to read your address at York; &amp; I do hope that it will appear in Nature or in some separate form.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>With kindest remembrances to all your party, ever my dear Huxley yours most sincerely Charles Darwin</p>
<p>PS. On further reflexion I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. like to hear that you receive this note safely. I have used up all my black-edged paper.</p>
