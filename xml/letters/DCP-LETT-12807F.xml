                    <p>I am very sorry that I forgot the Gardener’s address.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I hope you found it all right.</p>
                    <p>I am having a very nice time here, &amp; have all but done the bramble paper—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>The drawing room is all upside down so we live in H’s working room and the dining room   I think it will make a nice house, &amp; they seem very happy over it.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> They have at last finished Abney’s<ref target="#foot.f5"/> camera which is a blessing   Also Fulcher has come round to going in a peaceable manner &amp; remains friends with Dew   H looks on it as certain that he shall join Dew but it is still a state secret<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>The Greek question was lost, 185 to 145.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The Senate house was crammed with MAs, &amp; it was funny to see the mass of grey heads on the opposite side to us, it was all fogies &amp; country parsons   You have to sit down to vote, &amp; one saw people crouching down just to touch the edge of a seat till the Proctor had taken the vote.</p>
                    <p>Last night G dined here &amp; seems pretty well   Tonight we all three dine at F Balfours—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
                    <p>On Sat Jimmy &amp; I dine at Downing in Hall with Crawley,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> &amp; on Sunday in Trinity also in Hall so we have lots of dissipation—</p>
<p>I has turned muddy so it isnt worth while bicycling</p>
                    <p>I have got some stuff for spectacles— Horace says he asked Dew who answered at once but said he should like to have Michael’s authority and so asked him— It ∴ comes from Michael— I think his book is in shelf 30<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
                    <p>Tell Ubbadub I have been going in a tramway just like his tin one.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I hope the officer has come home again | Your affect son | Frank Darwin</p>
