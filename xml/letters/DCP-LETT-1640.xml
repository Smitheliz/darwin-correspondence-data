                <div type="transcription">
<p>You will I am sure pardon my negligence in having delayed my reply thus long to your letter received on Tuesday last (the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>.), for I have been so extremely busy in preparing for my departure, &amp; in finishing the arrangment of my collection for the British Museum, that I have been scarcely a free agent. I will now, however, answer your queries in the order in which you have asked them;<ref target="#foot.f1"/> though, had such been possible, a little more time to have thought over a few of them might have been desirable.</p>
<p>1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>., then, as regards the quæstio vexata of <hi rend="underline">Zargus Desertæ</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I have been looking at my specimen again this morning; &amp;, although I would not <hi rend="underline">positively</hi> affirm what appears to go so decidedly against experience, I am still inclined to believe it to be a true hybrid, rather than a monstrosity. Altho’ unquestionably more akin to <hi rend="underline">Calathus</hi> than <hi rend="underline">Zargus</hi>, it does nevertheless seem to me to unite so completely the characters of both that I cannot but imagine (when the circumstances of its capture are taken 〈into〉 account) that both <hi rend="doubleUnderline">genera</hi> (!!) have had a hand in producing it. You will however be able any day to <hi rend="underline">see</hi> it at the Museum (now that my Collection has been purchased,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> &amp; is to be kept <hi rend="underline">seperate</hi>), &amp; so judge for yourself. You will however remark that, not only is one <hi rend="underline">elytroso</hi> shorter than the other &amp; resembling that of <hi rend="underline">Zargus</hi>, but the very pronotum has the shape peculiar to each species on the respective sides; the mandibles are straightened &amp; elongated (one of the main features of <hi rend="underline">Zargus</hi>); &amp; the claws (judging from the 2 only which remain) are but <hi rend="underline">slightly pectinated</hi>,—thus uniting, as it were, the structure which obtains in the 2 insects, the serration being <hi rend="underline">extremely powerful</hi> in one, &amp; evanescent in the other. With all this however, I admit that it is <hi rend="doubleUnderline">more</hi> nearly related to <hi rend="underline">Calathus</hi> <hi rend="underline">Complanatus</hi> than to the <hi rend="underline">Zargus Desertæ</hi>,—as the sub-pectination of the claws (apparently in <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the legs) &amp; the almost entire upper-lip, together with its general facies, would appear to indicate: but still I cannot altogether regard it as <hi rend="underline">monstrous</hi>, seeing the amount of evidence which would appear to tell a different tale. Whatever it be however, the specimen was clearly but ill-developed in parts (as I suppose we should a fortiori <hi rend="underline">expect</hi>, under the contingencies which I have assumed),—the feet being dark, &amp; brittle in substance, at their extremities (so that the claws broke-off, almost without provocation), &amp; even the <hi rend="underline">ends of the palpi</hi> shewing the same tendency.—</p>
<p>2. The <hi rend="underline">Dezerta Grande</hi> <ref target="#foot.f4"/> is about 4 miles long, &amp; varies in breadth from a mere ridge (which it is scarcely possible to walk upon, tho’ it might be <hi rend="underline">ridden across</hi>, as on a horse’s back) to about three quarters of a mile. It rises to about 1600 feet, in its highest part, &amp; is <hi rend="underline">perfectly barren 〈&amp;〉 uninhabited</hi>,—tho’ it is said (&amp; there are indications of the fact) that a small colony once attempted to settle on it from Madeira; but were compelled to abandon it after a time, on account of the want of water. Even now however a <hi rend="doubleUnderline">small portion</hi> of the central valley is cultivated,—a certain n<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. of men residing every year (in the ruins of one of the old houses, which still exists, &amp; which has been patched-up to receive them) for the purpose of sowing corn, from Funchal, &amp; afterwards making an expedition to cut it.— I just mention this that you may not be surprised (when I come to that question) that I consider some few of <hi rend="underline">even the Dezertan insects</hi> as having been introduced.—</p>
<p>3. The <hi rend="doubleUnderline">6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. </hi> Salvagian<ref target="#foot.f5"/> insect (which you appear to have overlooked) is the <hi rend="underline">opatrum dilatatum</hi> (p. 501). I hope to freight a vessel to the Salvages in propriâ personâ this spring, with M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Lowe,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> —when I shall be better able to state whether or not these 6 species may be regarded as a fair exponent of the Coleopterous fauna of those rocks. Meanwhile, I am inclined to believe <hi rend="doubleUnderline">that</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">they are</hi>; for, although M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Leacock was only one day on the islands, &amp; is moreover no Entomologist, <hi rend="underline">he is a good general observer &amp;</hi> <hi rend="underline">collector</hi>, &amp; I know that he worked hard. He was however principally in quest of Land-shells (at which, altho’ not a Conchologist <hi rend="underline">in theory</hi>, he works <hi rend="doubleUnderline">admirably</hi>); &amp; it may be interesting to you to know that he only succeeded in procuring <hi rend="underline">one species</hi>,—since described by Lowe as <hi rend="underline">Helix ustulata</hi>.— The “<hi rend="doubleUnderline">Great</hi> <hi rend="underline">Piton</hi>” (as it is called, though in reality the <hi rend="underline">smaller</hi> 〈of〉 the 2 islands) appears to be the most productive of the rocks,—&amp; is described as 〈a〉 conical eminence, rising out of a sandy base, &amp; <hi rend="doubleUnderline">covered</hi> with plants. <hi rend="underline">All his</hi> species were collected on that island.</p>
<p>4. My note (p. xiii), on the <hi rend="underline">common</hi>-ness of certain insects,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> is intended to mean this: viz. that the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. 5</hi> (S. abbreviatus, L. morio, C. complanatus, H. vividus, &amp; H. cinerascens, in the <hi rend="underline">last</hi> of which <hi rend="underline">I include</hi> the Portosantan H. illotus) are apparently the <hi rend="underline">most generally distributed</hi> of the whole, occurring (as I believe) on every rock. I then add (as a seperate remark) that they are <hi rend="doubleUnderline">also</hi> (apart from being universally distributed) amongst the most abundant <hi rend="doubleUnderline">individually</hi> of all the species hitherto observed; &amp; I take the opportunity of stating that 7 <hi rend="underline">other</hi> species (although not universally distributed) are likewise amongst the “most abundant individually” (in their respective localities).—viz. T. lineatus, D. obscuroguttatus, O. Maderensis, O ventrosus, H. Pluto &amp; conpertus &amp; A. tristis.— This was merely <hi rend="underline">a selection</hi>, put in as a subsidiary remark; &amp; I might have added to them (&amp; perhaps <hi rend="underline">should</hi> have done) the <hi rend="underline">Oxytelus complanatus</hi>, as you well observe.— <hi rend="underline">Ptinus albopictus</hi> might possibly have been included also (being, altho’ generally rare, in profusion on the Ilheu Chão); but <hi rend="underline">no Tarphius</hi> (important as they are, as an assemblage) was <hi rend="doubleUnderline">sufficiently</hi> common to be admitted into the list.—</p>
<p>5. With regard to my observation (p. 584) that “transition groups” are usually “variable”,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I am of course only speaking (from personal knowledge) <hi rend="underline">Entomologically</hi>; though of course <hi rend="doubleUnderline">if</hi> such is true in one department of science, we should à priori expect to find it so in another. Whether such is the case or not, I do not presume to decide (not being in a position to do so); &amp;, that not being my province in the present work, I did not consider myself called on to moot the question generally: but in <hi rend="doubleUnderline">my own</hi> department of Zoology I am more &amp; more convinced that the statement is true,—for it seems to me that almost every family partakes <hi rend="underline">at either end</hi> (to a certain extent) of the peculiarities of that which immediately precedes &amp; follows it; so that <hi rend="underline">when these families</hi> (as is so often the case) become (as science advances) <hi rend="underline">themselves to be subdivided</hi>, it follows that the detachments at either end are of necessity <hi rend="underline">transitional</hi>,—&amp;, <hi rend="underline">as families</hi>, may be regarded as essentially variable, i.e. to say, as combining in a measure the distinguishing features of their <hi rend="doubleUnderline">opposite</hi> allies.— Almost <hi rend="underline">any</hi> families of the Coleoptera may be cited in illustration of this,—2 or 3 <hi rend="doubleUnderline">only</hi> being of a sufficiently isolated nature (as the <hi rend="underline">Carabidæ</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Trichopterygia</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Staphylinidæ</hi>,—the 1st. &amp; last of which are consequently made, as I cannot but believe rightly, in the <hi rend="underline">best systems</hi>, to commence &amp; wind-up the entire Order) <hi rend="underline">not</hi> to suit our purpose. But let us take, for example, the <hi rend="underline">Tomicidæ</hi> (the <hi rend="underline">Bostrichi</hi> of the <hi rend="underline">Continent</hi>): they are sometimes placed <hi rend="underline">in</hi> the Rhycophora &amp; sometimes <hi rend="underline">out</hi> of it,—&amp; this on account of the structure <hi rend="underline">of</hi> <hi rend="underline">their</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">feet</hi> (the most important character on which the Rhyncophora, as a department, is based). Thus, we know that the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">essential</hi> features of the Rhyncophora are, that their head s<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be <hi rend="underline">produced</hi> &amp; their tarsi <hi rend="underline">pseudotetramerous</hi> (i.e. 5-jointed; <hi rend="underline">with the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. joint minute &amp; concealed within the lobes of the 3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>. </hi>). Now, in the <hi rend="underline">Tomicidæ</hi>, the head is <hi rend="doubleUnderline">hardly</hi> ever <hi rend="underline">really</hi> rostrate; &amp;, altho’ the feet <hi rend="underline">have</hi> their 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. articulation usually diminished, as in the <hi rend="underline">normal Rhyncophoræ,</hi> <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">3<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>. is not (or very rarely) bilobed</hi>: thus varying in <hi rend="underline">the very minutiæ</hi> which serve, when properly carried-out, to constitute the “life-blood” as it were of the great Section into which, from the <hi rend="underline">Cissidæ</hi>, they lead us.— This is but one instance out of many, but it may just serve to shew what I mean: &amp; it was on such considerations that my special pleadings on the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">position</hi> of the <hi rend="underline">Anisotomidæ</hi> (which, I may add, I am <hi rend="doubleUnderline">not</hi> prepared to defend,—though as far as the <hi rend="underline">reasoning</hi> is concerned, I believe it to be a perfectly feasible one) were mainly based.—</p>
<p>6. I believe it to be true in Madeira that, <hi rend="underline">as a mere matter of observation &amp; fact</hi>, it is the “commonest” insects (i.e. to say, those which are most widely distributed) which vary most.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I am aware that we are not in a position to assert this <hi rend="underline">from theory</hi>, because we have no means of judging whether the scarcer things are subject to a like range of form: but it so happened, in reality, that I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> find much greater instability amongst those insects w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. were observed under <hi rend="underline">all circumstances</hi> (I refer, more particularly, to the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. <hi rend="doubleUnderline">5</hi> at p. xiii) than in those (although in profusion in their <hi rend="underline">respective localities</hi>) of a less universal nature: &amp;, hence, I felt myself justified in assuming that <hi rend="underline">the circumstances under</hi> <hi rend="underline">which the several species were placed</hi> had much to do in modifying their external contour,—the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">negative</hi> proposition, of whether the scarcer kinds would exhibit or not the same degree of inconstancy, <hi rend="underline">were they subject to similar agencies</hi>, not necessarily (as being an hypothetical case) coming within my province. (Albeit, from analogy, &amp; <hi rend="underline">such few</hi> facts as we possess, I believe that they <hi rend="doubleUnderline">w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. </hi> be governed by the same law).</p>
<p>7. And now, touching the question of <hi rend="doubleUnderline">wings</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I may just preface my remarks by stating that perhaps I ought not properly to have spoken of insects as “apterous”, but rather as “with the wings <hi rend="underline">obsolete</hi>”,—because I doubt if in any cases we should not be able to perceive the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. rudiments of wings, on close inspection,—even in those species which have connate elytra, &amp; which are usually looked-upon (since such to all <hi rend="doubleUnderline">practical</hi> purposes they <hi rend="underline">are</hi>) as <hi rend="doubleUnderline">literally</hi> <hi rend="underline">apterous</hi>. However, assuming that you will not deny the “<hi rend="underline">Alæ amplæ</hi>” &amp; “<hi rend="underline">alæ</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">obsoletæ</hi>” as correctly expressive of the 2 extremes, I have not the least hesitation in expressing my belief that all the intermediate grades may be (&amp; occasionally <hi rend="underline">are</hi>) found in the <hi rend="underline">same</hi> species,—or, in other words, that <hi rend="underline">the wings</hi> are essentially a variable organ, to be developed more or less according to the circumstances of the case. It certainly is so with many insects in our own country; but I never realised this principle so completely as in Madeira, where nearly everything which I have usually looked upon as <hi rend="underline">winged</hi> in more northern latitudes was there <hi rend="doubleUnderline">practically</hi> “apterous”. If therefore you will grant my premises, that an organ (however essential in some instances) <hi rend="doubleUnderline">may be</hi> variable (i.e. to say, may be <hi rend="underline">capable</hi> of developement according as required), I would go a step further &amp; subscribe heartily to your admirable solution,<ref target="#foot.f11"/> in the case of <hi rend="doubleUnderline">insular</hi> species, which chimes in better with my idea of adaptation than it has ever occurred to me to think of,—for it is clear that where the sphere for dissemination is <hi rend="doubleUnderline">prescribed</hi>, great powers of locomotion would be worthless: &amp; why may we not therefore assume that, since the period of their isolation, the means of flight (which would more often get them into trouble <hi rend="underline">than not</hi>) have been withdrawn. I do not think there can be any danger in this theory, since it does not touch the question of development in its <hi rend="underline">larger</hi> sense, or in any way border on transmutation,—each species having only certain <hi rend="underline">limits</hi> to vary between (greater or less according to the kind), beyond which (either in a progressive or retrograde movement) it cannot pass.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>(N.B. If this appears dogmatical, do not laugh at it,—for you have of course studied this subject far more than I have).</p>
<p>I have not gone sufficiently into the question to measure <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">degree of variation</hi> in the wings of the same species <hi rend="underline">on the same</hi> <hi rend="underline">island</hi>, having been contented with the <hi rend="underline">general fact</hi> (of which, in my own judgment, I had <hi rend="underline">satisfied</hi> myself) that they were subject to almost indefinite variation. A priori, however, I should imagine that the range of development would <hi rend="underline">not</hi> be very great, geographical causes seeming to be one of the main points by which (in the present instance) it has been regulated; and, although we may easily detect <hi rend="doubleUnderline">small</hi> differences almost alongside each other, I suspect that we must view the same insect in countries far distant (or, at any rate, very oppositely constituted, as regards land &amp; water) to see this <hi rend="underline">tendency to variation</hi> in the light of a bonâ fide reality.—</p>
<p>8. Next, as regards poor Forbes’s <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Atlantis</hi>,<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I dare not dogmatise much (&amp; indeed you must be getting tired of my meanderings); I may however add a few remarks, of a loose &amp; desultory nature, which may bear indirectly on the subject. How far this great question <hi rend="underline">can be solved</hi> by the comparison of the fauna of the present islands, inter se, I will not venture to suggest; but, assuming that some light <hi rend="underline">may be</hi> thrown upon it in this manner, my own observations &amp; general train of ideas would rather tend, I think, to <hi rend="underline">uphold</hi> Forbes’ theory (to a certain degree) than to undermine it. In the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. place then, I start with the admission that <hi rend="underline">these are</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">not</hi> <hi rend="underline">the days of migration</hi> (in the sense that would have been understood in ante- miocene times); or, in other words, that the period when Forbes’s plants came across from the Germanic plains to England, his Iberian Saxifrages from Gallicia, &amp; my insects wandered northwards through this Atlantic region (<hi rend="underline">whenever these successive æras</hi> <hi rend="underline">may have been</hi>) was marked by a more rapid provision for the self- dissemination of life than now; &amp; I likewise <hi rend="underline">assume</hi> that (in the same manner as Forbes’s “British” plants came 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. into existence in a country beyond the British isles,—i.e. on the great Germanic plain) this “miocene continent” was specially rich in “centres of diffusion created expressly for itself”, &amp; that the general breaking up of the land of passage must have taken place at <hi rend="underline">no</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">very</hi> <hi rend="underline">remote</hi> period after its insect fauna came into being; or, at any rate, that the 〈<hi rend="doubleUnderline">gre</hi>〉<hi rend="doubleUnderline">ater portion</hi> of it must have been destroyed before the several species <hi rend="underline">had permeated far</hi>. With these crude &amp; general ideas (which are of course mere theory, &amp; on none of which would I presume to insist), we will just turn for an instant to a few facts, &amp; see how far they are countenanced by observation. So far as I know of the Insect fauna of the Canaries, the Salvages, Madeiras, the opposite coast of Africa, &amp; the Spanish peninsular, there do certainly seem to be traces of a general migration of the species, in a north-easterly direction, from <hi rend="underline">several</hi> successive centres of radiation. Thus, for instance, take the genus <hi rend="underline">Hegeter</hi>,—which finds its maximum in the Canary islands (the land of <hi rend="underline">Hegeters</hi>). 2 species (out of about 20) have found their way to the opposite coast of Africa; <hi rend="underline">one</hi> of these 2 (probably of rapid dissemination) had reached the Madeira Islands, &amp; even the S.W. of Portugal, in those migratory days; whilst the Salvages (the nearest of all to the Canaries) produces another (different to those “2”), which is probably identical with a species described from Teneriffe. Let us now go a little more northward, to the Madeiras, &amp; take another case. Like Hegeter, in the Canaries, Madeira may be called “the land of <hi rend="underline">Tarphii</hi>. There are 15 species of this genus in Madeira proper, but in the Canary Islands none have ever yet been observed. <hi rend="underline">One</hi> however appears (like the 3 Hegeters from the Canaries) to be “given-off”, in a north-easterly direction,—&amp;, after attaining its maximum in P<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. S<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>.,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> turns-up again in <hi rend="doubleUnderline">Sicily</hi>!!—</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Ditylus</hi>, again, does not occur in Madeira, but there are 2 or 3 species common in Teneriffe: now <hi rend="underline">one</hi> of these (or, at any rate, a species <hi rend="underline">closely</hi> allied to it,—&amp; probably only a “species”, so called, thro’ the modifying effects of isolation!) had reached the Salvages (the movement likewise <hi rend="underline">northerly</hi>);—&amp; the same may be said of an <hi rend="underline">Acalles</hi> w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. I have described from those rocks.— I will not however multiply cases; suffice it to observe that <hi rend="doubleUnderline">I think</hi> I can trac〈e a〉 decided northerly movement throughout the whole insect-fauna of this region; or, in other words, that where the more southern portions impart 20 species to those north of them, <hi rend="underline">not one</hi> seems to have passed from north to south: &amp; hence (if this be true) I should join issue with you as to the <hi rend="underline">necessity</hi> of the Spanish species crossing over to Madeira<ref target="#foot.f15"/> even had a miocene continent ever existed to constitute a land of passage; whilst the fact of my species being found (in a gradually diminishing ratio) as you proceed to the N.E. (or towards the Mediterranean bason) would become in part intelligible.</p>
<p>And here I may just say a word on your 9<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. question, as to what is my idea concerning the total absence of certain large (&amp; all but universal) groups from the Madeiran fauna. I do <hi rend="underline">not</hi> believe that it is through any physical peculiarity in the country itself,—seeing that there are abundant conditions in a land of flowers for the sustenance of the <hi rend="underline">Cetoniadæ</hi> (indeed they w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. seem almost, were it not for the amount of Hymenoptera &amp; Diptera, to be <hi rend="underline">required</hi>), in the deep mossy ravines for the <hi rend="underline">Pselaphi</hi>, &amp; at the roots of the grass, in the large open tracts of a high elevation, for the larvæ of the <hi rend="underline">Elateridæ</hi>. I can only therefore conclude that <hi rend="underline">this was</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">not</hi> <hi rend="underline">the region of their creation</hi>, &amp; that they had not migrated to these spots of ground (either from S. or East) before the breaking-up of the surrounding land.—<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I could add a 〈go〉od deal more (of a far more interesting nature), concerning the <hi rend="doubleUnderline">direction</hi> 〈of migra〉tion, gathered from the Land-Mollusca (at w<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. I worked hard), but I fear I have not time now: suffice it therefore to state that they tell the same story as the insects,—only (if I understand them aright) far more clearly.—</p>
<p>10. Of the Dezertan species which you mention, 3 (Ceutorhynchus quadridens, Haltica subtilis &amp; Philonthus sordidus) are <hi rend="doubleUnderline">certainly</hi> introduced (as they are into Madeira proper), &amp; these are winged: the other 3 (Ptinus fragilis, &amp; Tychius robustus &amp; albosquamosus) are indigenous &amp; with the wings obsolete.—</p>
<p>This, I think <hi rend="underline">notices</hi> all your queries, (I cannot say <hi rend="underline">replies to them</hi>): if in my haste I have not expressed myself clearly everywhere, you must forgive me, for I have really not had time to <hi rend="underline">think</hi> sufficiently over your observations; &amp; if I have anywhere committed myself, you will I doubt not be charitable, &amp; will not “shew me up”.— I perfectly <hi rend="underline">delight</hi> in islands; for, being little worlds in themselves, everything within them is suggestive; whilst each individual fact which one gathers becomes of greater interest, where there is a theory to establish, than twenty times the number on the mainland. I hope to start for Madeira <hi rend="underline">either</hi> (by the Steamer, f<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Southampton) on Friday next (in which case I should leave Town on Thursday); or else by the Eclipse (from London) on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>—.— Anything more that I can do for you <hi rend="underline">in situ</hi>, I shall be very glad, if you will only let me know what it is.</p>
<p>And now I must relieve you from this state of purgatory, which I feel has been protracted beyond its proper limits; &amp;, hoping that you will make allowances for my tremendous haste, Believe me, | my dear Sir, | Your’s very sincerely | T V Wollast〈on〉</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">P.S.</hi> You are much too liberal in your judgment concerning my opusculum,—which is, after all, whatever may have been the labour spent on it, but “a drop dissevered f<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. the boundless sea”.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> That it should afford you the slightest amount of “old information, freshly put” (for I cannot call it <hi rend="underline">new</hi>) is very satisfactory to me.—</p>

Wollaston considered these to be ‘very interesting and anomalous little beetles’ in which the number of tarsi (joints) in the legs were extremely variable (p. 483). Reasoning from this phenomenon, he claimed ‘so completely is variableness the very essence of a <hi rend="italic">transition</hi> group, that, when we find great mutability to exist in any series of characters, we are even <hi rend="italic">à priori</hi> led to suspect that the assemblage in which it occurs is in all probability connective between <hi rend="italic">some two others</hi>.’ (p. 484).

            <note xml:id="foot.f9">CD had recently expanded his survey of the number of species in aberrant genera to investigate the number of species and the geographical range of common or successful genera. He believed that organisms which ranged over a large geographical area and were individually numerous would be the forms most likely to vary and adapt to changing conditions (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_989.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Browne 1980</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f10">Wollaston stated that the two principal features of the Madeiran Coleoptera were the general dullness of the colouring and a tendency to be wingless (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8452.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1854</ref>, p. xii).

            <note xml:id="foot.f11">CD, reasoning from the principle of selection, maintained that in locations like the islands of the Madeira group, which were small in size and extremely windy, wings would endanger species by exposing them to the possibility of being blown out to sea. This explanation for the existence of wingless insects is proposed in the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1643.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Hooker, 7 March [1855]</ref>.

            <note xml:id="foot.f12">Wollaston, like most contemporary natural historians, interpreted the variations in wing development mainly in terms of adaptive use and disuse within the limits of species type.

Wollaston had commented on the apparent relationship between some of the endemic species on Madeira and those of south-west Britain and Ireland and cited Forbes’s paper, stating that ‘it is impossible to deny that, so far as the Madeiras betoken, everything would go to favour this grand and comprehensive idea.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8452.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1854</ref>, p. xiii).</note>
