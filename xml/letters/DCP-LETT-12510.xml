                    <p>If the M.S be sent <hi rend="underline">registered</hi> to me I will begin the copying at once as I can borrow a machine here.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have just finished the paper at wh. I am at work &amp; shall have time &amp; ought to get it done in a fortnight or so.</p>
                    <p>Leo. will have told you that we paid him £50 for which he agreed to exhaust London resources, but he has been outside his contract &amp; has got the wills at Lincoln searched.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Do you think of giving more; I suspect he w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. accept if it were done delicately. What a lot of work he must have spent.</p>
<p>I have been having a bad cold in my head &amp; somewhat on my chest but have got thro’ so far rather better than usual as I have only been languid &amp; stupid &amp; have continued doing a little work. I fear however the later stages more than the active nose-blowing.</p>
                    <p>As I said above I have just finished off my paper &amp; shall send it to the R. S in the day or two. I am glad to say it will be short eno’ for the Proceedings<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>We are getting on with the pendulum but have been delayed by finding the stone pillar is not isolated from the floor &amp; so have been having the paving up &amp; have got bricklayers &amp; carpenters at work<ref target="#foot.f4"/>   I hope we shall get to work again in a day or two.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I observed a little &amp; thought the thing wobbled when cabs drove along a street 60 yds away— this proves its sensitiveness but does’nt look very hopeful for our doing anything in a town.</p>
                    <p>I can’t remember whether I told you that Sackville Cecil &amp; I propose going down to Glasgow together after Easter. I’m sorry to say he’s got another railway place &amp; is not going to come here after all.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>I enclose a pleasant letter of M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>Lennan’s which gives a better account of things at Davos. I hope they will adhere to the scheme of coming to Hayes.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
                    <p>I’m sorry to hear that you are knocked up &amp; I hope going to London will do you good<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I find these incessant colds very disheartening, it is now many months that I have had more or less of a break down every 10 days &amp; it never gives one time to get into good order between whiles.</p>
                    <p>I shall be tremendously interested with Col. Chester’s papers.</p>
