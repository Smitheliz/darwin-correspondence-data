                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I remember well what you mention about the slate coloured &amp; White Muscovy Ducks.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The Slate coloured, I imagine, were the produce of some cross raised at Birmingham. I have never seen them since nor do I think I ever reared any, as I lost the Drake.</p>
<p>The white always breed true to colour, as far as my experience goes, &amp; I keep a large flock of them—(I have about 20 now)—</p>
<p>With however this exception that they have a great tendency to a Black Topper on head (exactly as represented in Bewicks plate).<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Unless some considerable pains are taken in weeding out all these black topped Birds—the <hi rend="underline">pure white</hi> would soon cease.</p>
<p>I never saw however a single black feather any where but on the top of Head.</p>
<p>The Black Lambs I also well remember.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> They were Southdown Ewes. The Ram I never saw— He was provided by Giblitt the Great Butcher<ref target="#foot.f5"/>—and I was told in answer to my enquiries that he was all but white, having a small patch only of Black—<hi rend="underline">I think</hi> about the head. The flock was the queerest I ever saw, and <hi rend="underline">every</hi> lamb being black in the lot, looks as if there was a positive law of some kind in the matter.</p>
<p>I will write to ask if M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Woodds man<ref target="#foot.f6"/> remembers where the Black was in Ram, but I fear it will not be satisfactorily answered.</p>
<p>The Ram appeared cross bred with a good deal of Southdown in him.</p>
<p>The only <hi rend="underline">pure</hi> cross of Sheep I know (if one can use such a term)—are between pure Leicester &amp; Southdown. I think it was the late Earl Morton<ref target="#foot.f7"/> who had a beautiful flock of these. They had no horns—&amp; partook of each strain.</p>
<p>I have a small flock of the black &amp; white sheep—which keep very true to shape &amp; colour. When crossed with Leicester they produce a race pretty nearly balanced—except that there is a great tendency to Black lambs. The only 3 born this year are black. Having once got the black strain in this way from a cross with the black &amp; white &amp; Leicester—it takes many generations—at least 6 or 7—I am told by a friend of mine—to get back the white colour—by continual crossing with a Leicester. I can only speak to the <hi rend="underline">3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> </hi> generation—which was as black as the first.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have never seen or heard of <hi rend="underline">horned</hi> produce from hornless crosses. I do not think they exist so in our English crosses. The Cheviot &amp; Leicester are often crossed—&amp; certainly have no horns— Neither have the Southdown &amp; Leicester.</p>
<p>There seems little tendency in crosses of <hi rend="underline">Sheep</hi> to return to primordial wildness—as the Irish have been almost renovated by the Leicester cross: and the Shropshire Down sheep are a greatly improved cross bred sheep.</p>
<p>I fear I have not added much to my former notes on these points.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>What I wrote at time, may be strictly depended upon— In this letter you will see what are surmises only.</p>
<p>I should be very glad to hear of your getting to Malvern for 6 or 8 weeks.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> It is a glorious place for renovating the health in. If my time &amp; means would allow of it, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> go for a month every spring &amp; be got into condition. I quite believe I owe my life to it in my last illness—and it was a curious illustration of <hi rend="underline">the System</hi> versus the D<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. as Gully completely denied the existence of what I told him was my conceived idea of my wretchedness—but added “Well if it is so, the water cure will prove its existence—and so it did. I have never met with more than one similar case, which was most carefully treated according to rule, and the young man died of it.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you how glad I was to see you so well in London.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> It was a great pleasure to see so many old &amp; valued faces—&amp; all looking so well. I very much want to see Susan and Caroline again.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>If you go to Malvern I shall try to come over &amp; get a weeks bathing while you are there. I have some curious enquiries about you &amp; your Book sometime. You ought to occupy a cage by the side of the Gorilla in the British Museum sometimes to let the Public see you.—</p>
<p>Kindest regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin.— Ever yours sincerely | W D Fox</p>
