<p>What does CD think of A. R. Wallace’s paper in the <hi rend="italic">Annals &amp; Magazine of Natural History</hi> ["On the law which has regulated the introduction of new species", n.s. 16 (1855): 184–96]? EB considers it good on the whole.</p> 
            <p>Japanned variety of peacock.</p>
            <p>Regional variations in bird species.</p>
            <p>EB has little faith in the aboriginal wildness of the Chillingham cattle.</p>
            <p>Races of humped cattle of India, China, and Africa.</p>
            <p>Indian and Malayan gigantic squirrels, with various races remaining true to their colour, would afford capital data for Wallace, as would the local varieties of certain molluscs. Has Wallace’s lucid collation of facts unsettled CD’s ideas regarding the persistence of species?</p> 
<p>Bengal hybrid race of geese is very uniform in colour and as prolific as the European tame goose [see <hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi>, p. 439].</p> 
            <p>Will see what he can do for CD with regard to domestic pigeons.</p>

                    <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
<p>This afternoon I have had the pleasure of receiving yours of 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>., and as the mail closes <hi rend="underline">this evening</hi>, I hasten to reply at once. I have not written to you lately, from sheer want of time; but have noted down a few matters to comment upon, when I found an opportunity. What think you of Wallace’s paper in the <hi rend="underline">Ann. M. N. H.</hi> ?<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Good! Upon the whole! But how about such forms as the <hi rend="underline">Giraffe</hi>, which has <hi rend="underline">typical</hi> representatives in the Siwálik tertiary deposits? Or the true Elk (=Moose)? Can we suppose <hi rend="underline">a lost series of gradations</hi> connecting these genera with the Deer type, &amp; ramifying off to them <hi rend="underline">paulatim</hi> ? Wallace has, I think, put the matter well; and according to his theory, the various domestic races of animals have been fairly developed into <hi rend="underline">species</hi>. I think that I before said that the Peacock had not varied for so many centuries of domestication in Europe, further than as regards albinism, complete or partial; but I overlooked the interesting “sport” of colour, exhibited by the <hi rend="underline">Japanned</hi> (not ‘Japan’) variety, which seems to have originated more than once,—vide especially Sir R. Heron, in the <hi rend="underline">Proc Zool. Soc</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> A trump of a fact for friend Wallace to have hit upon! The <hi rend="underline">Pavo</hi> <hi rend="underline">muticus</hi>, I may remark, is much more brilliantly coloured in the Malay countries than it is in the Burmese; &amp; the late Ld Derby suspected a distinctness of species. Some day I may have an opportunity of seeing further to this matter. In like manner the Malayan &amp; <hi rend="underline">Burmese</hi> Jungle-fowl is deeper-coloured than that of India, and moreover it seems to have always a coarser leg, tending to become yellow, the cheek-lappets being also red like the comb, &amp; the bird being so much more easily domesticable, that I cannot help suspecting that we owe its domestication to the regions inhabited by this trans-Indian <hi rend="underline">wild variety</hi>. You know I have little faith in the aboriginal wildness of the white Chillingham cattle, arguing even from colour alone!<ref target="#foot.f3"/> Well, you remember the innate wildness of the calves, so often insisted upon; wherefore I call your particular attention to a passage by Buchanan Hamilton, published in Montgomery Martin’s compilation of his writings, Vol. 1, 504, only for “<hi rend="underline">Bos taurus</hi>”, read <hi rend="underline">B. indicus</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> See the same author’s Journey through Mysore, &amp;c, Vol. 2, for some notices of the races of humped cattle, with figures.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have not travelled about enough to be any authority on this subject: but have been told that those in Ceylon are small, compact, &amp; dark-coloured animals; ditto in Burma; whereas the prevalent colour here is white. Bombay people might tell you more about the Indian races of cattle, of which the finest come from Cutch, Guzerat, &amp; the neighbouring provinces. Try also to learn what humped cattle there are in S. China (if any); also about those in Madagascar (which supply the Mauritius &amp; Bourbon with <hi rend="underline">beef</hi>); and about the African races, of which the Galla cattle &amp; those of Borneo are the most remarkable. I have seen oxen in Madras, with enormous horns, &amp; altogether very similar to the Galla race. The group of Indian Monkeys affined to the Bengal <hi rend="underline">Entellus</hi>, &amp; the group of Indian &amp; Malayan gigantic Squirrels, so diversified in colour, &amp; yet each race so remarkably true to its colouring, afford capital data for M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wallace to descant upon, in reference to his views. Again, among land mollusks, the <hi rend="underline">Bulimus perversus</hi>. A lot of this species just brought from Burma are remarkable for having a blackish-red mantle, unlike any I have seen before. The many varieties of this beautiful shell seem each to be local, certainly to a great extent, &amp; have perhaps as good claim to be regarded as <hi rend="underline">species</hi> as the gigantic Squirrels have,—unlike our familiar English <hi rend="underline">Helix</hi> <hi rend="underline">nemoralis</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wallace could also well support his views by reference to the <hi rend="underline">Helices</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Bulimi</hi> collected in the Philippines by Cuming,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> —&amp; also to the varieties of the Indian <hi rend="underline">Melaniæ</hi>. What do <hi rend="underline">you</hi> think of the paper in question? Has it at all unsettled your ideas regarding the persistence of species,—not perhaps so much from novelty of argument, as by the lucid collation of facts &amp; phenomena. On the other hand, consider over the nice distinctions among the very numerous European <hi rend="underline">Helices</hi>, &amp; how true each remains to its structural characters; &amp; this over vast geographical areas! How is it that we do not oftener meet with such a fact as that recorded of the <hi rend="underline">Japanned</hi> Peafowl?— On the ancient history of the cultivated rose, see a paper published by the Botanic Society of Edinbro Jan<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1838, &amp; noticed in the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. Vol. of the <hi rend="underline">Ann.</hi> <hi rend="underline">Nat Hist.</hi>, p. 228.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The oldest mention here cited is one or more by Anacreon, 600 B.C.</p>
<p>For the <hi rend="underline">Ayin Akbari</hi>, consult the well known translation by Gladwin, 2 Vols. 8 vo.,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> which you might see at the India-house or British Museum libraries, &amp;c &amp;c. Our hybrid race of tame Geese. So far as I have seen, these are very uniform in character; and they are fully as prolific as the European tame Goose. Their colouring is that of <hi rend="underline">cygnoides</hi>, but I think the longitudinal nape-streak is scarcely so deep—but they are generally white or partially white: the form intermediate to <hi rend="underline">cygnoides</hi> &amp; ordinary <hi rend="underline">Anser</hi>; the frontal knob much reduced; &amp; colour of this &amp; of the bill &amp; feet light orange, with often black spots and small patches on the feet. True <hi rend="underline">cygnoides</hi> has black bill &amp; feet, excepting the white race or variety, which has them of a bright orange. Remember that I am describing <hi rend="underline">from memory</hi>, as the mail is about to close. You ask me to publish my ideas about the domestic Cat. I may do so in a series of papers which I have promised to write for the ‘Calcutta Sporting Review’, where I have undertaken “the Feline animals of India”,—have already got a long article on Asiatic Lions printed off, and have partly written one on the Tiger— Moreover I have written a long article upon “wild Asses”, of which I think I have proved that only one species is known, which is the <hi rend="underline">Ghor-Khur</hi> (or ‘Horse-Ass’), hemionus (or ‘half-Ass’) <hi rend="underline">hemippus</hi> (or ‘<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> horse’), &amp;c &amp;c, including onager (or ‘wild Ass’) &amp; the Tibetan <hi rend="underline">Kyang</hi>. True, the contrast is enormous between Guzerat, Rajputana, &amp; Cutch,—the lowland sandy desert,—&amp; the intensely cold elevated regions of Tibet; but though he does not pass through the Punjab &amp; up the wooded regions of the Himalaya, he is nevertheless find in Sindh, Afghanistan, Mesopotamia, &amp; through northern Persia right up to the Aral, in gradually increasing numbers, &amp; then all through Gt. Tartary to the frontiers of Tibet, according to Pallas, &amp; in Tibet as the Khyang. Gmelins supposed wild Ass is merely a <hi rend="underline">Dziggetai</hi> with a short shoulder stripe,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> such as has likewise been seen in Indian specimens, but very rarely. I will send you all these papers as soon as I can, &amp; if you ask me why I publish them in a sporting Journal, it is because I get about £5 a piece for them, &amp; besides I address through such a medium a great number of observers, from whom I hope to elicit more facts.
