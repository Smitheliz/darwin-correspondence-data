            <p>Comments on his visit to N. Wales and the evidence of glaciation, of which he feels certain.</p>
            <p>His marine theory [of the parallel roads of Glen Roy] has revived after Louis Agassiz’s "ice work" knocked it on the head.</p>

<p>When I sent off the glacier paper,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I was just going out &amp; had no time to write— I hope your friend will enjoy (&amp; I wish you were going there with him) his tour, as much as I did— it was a kind of geological novel, but your friend must have patience for he will not get a good <hi rend="underline">glacial eye</hi> for a few days. Murchison &amp; Count Keyserling<ref target="#foot.f2"/> <hi rend="underline">rushed</hi> through North Wales the same autumn &amp; could see nothing except the effects of rain trickling over the rocks! I cross-examined Murchison a little &amp; evidently saw he had looked carefully at nothing. I feel <hi rend="underline">certain </hi> about the glacier-effects in N. Wales.—</p>
<p>We are all well here, that is fairly well for such wretches, as we. Emma will be confined this month.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> What glorious weather— Saturday felt as hot to me, as ever did the Brazils.—</p>
<p>Get up your steam, if this weather lasts, &amp; have a ramble in Wales— its glorious scenery must do every one’s heart &amp; body good.— I wish I had energy to come to Delamere &amp; go with you; but as you observe, you might as well ask St. Paulls. Whenever I give myself a trip, it shall be, I think, to Scotland to hunt for more parallel roads.</p>
<p>My marine theory for these roads was for a time knocked on the head by Agassiz ice-work—but it is now reviving again.— I dont mean, that I ever doubted, but others did (even Lyell for a time became a catastrophist) &amp; they have now gone back to the elevation theory. The contrast between the valleys of N. Wales, which have had all their rubbish &amp; detritus swept out by the glaciers &amp; those of Scotland, from which the sea has slowly retired, is very striking.—</p>
<p>We have had a visit of some weeks from Elizabeth Wedgwood, &amp; I think the change has done her good after her incessant nursing of her father.</p>
<p>Farewell— we are getting nearly finished—almost all the workmen gone &amp; the gravel laying down on the walks— Ave Maria how the money does go— there are twice as many temptations to extravagance in the country compared with London.—</p>
<p>Adios | Yours | C. Darwin</p>
