<p>I am very glad to hear from Hooker<ref target="#foot.f2"/> that you are so much better and that all your party are well.</p>
<p>I returned home about two months since, very much better for my trip, and I hope to be able to continue my work again—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I shall give it a trial till next spring.</p>
<p>My wife went with me abroad, we worked our way by Paris &amp; Toulon to Nice; and then after some days on to Mentone, &amp; San Remo, for about the same time. Then Genoa Milan &amp; by the Italian Lakes over the Simplon to Vevey: during these frequent journeys I did not feel much better, as I was not long enough to rest in one place, but two quiet months in Switzerland made me feel quite well, &amp; my wife taking a walking fit for the first time in her life, we got up various hills, till I was able to stand nine hours walking (6<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> up hill) to one 6,000 feet which was our highest. To do this without feeling any weakness or pain in right leg or head showed I had gained much strength, as for years my leg felt a few miles walk, &amp; I rarely walked at all without some pain.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>As the Continent was new to both of us we enjoyed it very much. The only thing I saw in the shape of a fossil was small plants in fine laminated sand stone near Mentone, but I suppose they are very common.</p>
<p>FitzRoy,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> when I returned, was looking much broken and thin but he has been away for his holiday &amp; is looking very much better again. Mellersh returned from South America last week &amp; is going to take the new Retirement which gives better pay. Johnson has also taken it.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Gemmy Usborne now (“Staff Commander” Usborne) has command of a surveying steamer at Plymouth. Stokes by a <hi rend="underline">Job</hi> forced politically in some way on the adm<hi rend="superscript">lty</hi>. got nominally put in a small schooner at Plymouth to complete <hi rend="underline">his time</hi> &amp; so has gone on the active adm<hi rend="superscript">ty</hi> list being by our <hi rend="underline">wise regulations</hi> the only one of Beagles supposed fit for Command of a Squadron.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>We are all very well, my two boys in Navy both returned lately—one is now on Excellent to pass for Gunnery<ref target="#foot.f8"/> the other in Channel fleet.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>With very kind regards to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Darwin &amp; all your party | Believe me very since<hi rend="superscript">ly</hi></p>
<p>Yours | B. J. Sulivan</p>

Mellersh had been serving as captain of HMS <hi rend="italic">Forte</hi>, a flagship stationed on the south-east coast of South America, since November 1862; he was granted his retirement on 9 September 1864. Under an Order in Council dated 9 July 1864, captains aged 50 and over were eligible for retirement, at a rate of pay of 18<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> or 20<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> per day, according to seniority, at the discretion of the Board of Admiralty, and providing that they had served a combined period of fifteen years at sea in the ranks of lieutenant, commander, or captain. Formerly, the minimum retirement age was 55, and Mellersh might have spent the remainder of his naval service up to retirement not employed and on the Admiralty’s half-pay lists, under which the maximum rate of pay for a captain was 14<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> per day. The voluntary retirement age was lowered to reduce the number of captains eligible for active service, and to provide greater opportunities for younger officers to get promotion. Johnson was granted his retirement on 1 July 1864.

Usborne was appointed staff-commander in the Surveying Service on 11 June 1863, and Stokes was appointed rear-admiral on 9 February 1864. In April 1864, Usborne succeeded to the command of HMS <hi rend="italic">Bann</hi>, a paddle surveying vessel, to obtain the deep-sea soundings off the coast of Cornwall necessary to complete the charts of the west coast of England (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1886.xml">Dawson 1885</ref>, p. 122). In order to qualify for promotion, Stokes was required to command one or more of Her Majesty’s rated ships for a period of between four and six years, depending on whether the period fell during wartime or peacetime or both (see <hi rend="italic">Report from the select committee on Navy (Promotion and Retirement)</hi> (British parliamentary papers, Session 1863, 10: 542–3)). Sulivan was one of the witnesses called by the select committee to give evidence on naval regulations in 1863 (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>); some of the reforms he proposed are summarised in Sulivan ed. 1896, pp. 423–4.
