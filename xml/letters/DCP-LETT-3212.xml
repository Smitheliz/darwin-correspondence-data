<p>It would be a real pleasure to me to give you any information in aid of your most difficult &amp; laborious undertaking.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> But I am sorry to say that I am quite unable to answer any of your questions. It is now nearly 30 years since I began examining living corals,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but other pursuits interfered &amp; I have utterly forgotten what little I knew. I remember attending a little to the effects of tranquil &amp; disturbed water on their growth; but I cannot remember to what conclusion I came; but as a general rule, I think nearly all the species were distinct. I remember being impressed with the conviction that the classification of the stony corals would be very difficult.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>From all that I know of Dana, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. feel much inclined to place much trust in him. What a misfortune it is that his health has so much failed!<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I am very sorry that I am so entirely incompetent to render any assistance, &amp; remain, Dear Sir, with my best wishes | Yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD had collected and made notes on a number of different corals and coralline algae during the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> voyage. His descriptions of corals are included in his Zoological diary (DAR 30 and 31), and several of his drawings of these specimens are in DAR 29.3. A few of his observations on corals were published in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1571.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Coral reefs</hi></ref>. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6351.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Porter 1985</ref>.

Of the 483 corals described, 229 were new, and Dana’s classification of this difficult group has remained of value to the present day (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2160.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DSB</hi></ref>). CD had corresponded with Dana during the preparation of his monograph on the Cirripedia (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vols. 4 and 5). In 1859, Dana’s health had forced him to give up his scientific pursuits for an extended period, and he had not yet fully recuperated from his illness.</note>
