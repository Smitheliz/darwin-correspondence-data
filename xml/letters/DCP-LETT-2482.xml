            <p>Sorry to hear of AS’s poor health.</p>
            <p>Would like to attend Aberdeen meeting [BAAS, 1859] but is unfit for so great an exertion. Has been told he has "suppressed gout".</p>
            <p>Pleased that AS remembers their 1831 geological trip, which made CD appreciate the noble science of geology.</p>

<p>You must let me thank you in my wife’s &amp; own name for your most kind note.— My wife never dreamed that you would trouble yourself in answering her, otherwise she would have scrupled in calling your attention to the case. All that she expected was, that if your votes had been disengaged you would consider the case.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear so poor an account of your health.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I should much like to attend at Aberdeen, but I am utterly unfit for so great an exertion.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am told that I suffer from suppressed gout!<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Whatever it is, I am made wretched &amp; almost useless.—</p>
<p>I am pleased that you remember my attending you in your excursion in 1831. To me, it was a memorable event in my life; I felt it a great honour, &amp; it stimulated me to work, &amp; made me appreciate the noble science of geology.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Believe me that I thank you sincerely for your kind expressions towards me. With entire respect &amp; honour | I remain | Yours sincerely obliged | Charles Darwin</p>
