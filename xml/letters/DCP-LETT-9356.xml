<p>I assure you I am sincerely ashamed of the trouble I give you with the imperfect statistics which I have sent and send still.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Please don’t answer in any way, until I have done getting in such returns as are likely. I had a most cordial Irish note the other day from the breeder of that most celebrated Greyhound “Master Magrath”—whom I did not before know from Adam—saying that when the bustle of the Assizes in his town should be got rid of, he would be delighted to answer my queries (whence I infer that he is a lawyer of some sort.)<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I had written also to the proprietor of “Peasant Boy” (the leading Favourite, I believe, though now defeated by an outsider, for the great cup of the coursing Derby.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I have not yet heard from him—and did not know him before—but I shall stir him up. I want to pick up statistics of the kind for you during the next few weeks—even although they should not help at all for the present. Who knows what one may hit upon—or to what use it may turn some day. Surely it is abominable that statistics are never thought of in a scientific light by breeders &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>I might have some remarks or notes to make when I send in what I get in this way—on the general run of the thing in Greyhounds &amp;c—to be taken for what they are worth (probably nothing, but not nonsensical.</p>
<p>I had read about the Todas, with interest.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>How wonderful a <hi rend="underline">worker</hi> you must be! The youngest of scientific inquirers, with his mark to begin making—might well be astonished at this alone. For myself, in view of it, I sit as it were in the dust, in sackloth and in ashes—glad were it only to be employed in the humblest service, though it should prove useless.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It is well-meant—and all over the world there are hundreds and hundreds of men like-spirited towards you, who I wish could have the opportunity to enlist themselves—young, strong, in China, in Japan, everywhere throughout the range of civilization. The <hi rend="underline">habit</hi> will spread, at all events—and this, to <hi rend="underline">you</hi>, will be a satisfaction.</p>

<p>Absence from home must bring my apology for not having answered yours of the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. Inst: earlier. I am afraid my “answers” will be almost valueless nevertheless as you <hi rend="underline">have</hi> requested me to give an opinion I have done so.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have bred dogs of many kinds since I was 20 years of age, but never kept any statistics, so I can only speak from memory &amp; laterly from my stud book wh<hi rend="superscript">h</hi>. is far from a complete affair however. I cannot give you any names of greyhound breeders with whom I am acquainted—but the sporting papers are always advertising sales as from the kennels of various gentlemen—who <hi rend="underline">breed</hi> the saplings<ref target="#foot.f7"/> they send for sale— M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Clarke of Howden is one<ref target="#foot.f8"/>—but I do not recollect others at present; People who w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. probably be able to give you information on these subjects—w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be the owners of <hi rend="underline">Stallion</hi> greyhounds who breed a good deal from their own dogs— there is a whole column in the Field—weekly.<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>I have no puppies to part with at present—I have a brace, that are more wolfhound than any yet bred— but I fear they do not promise the size I long for— Their dam, a very tall bitch, is to go to the largest deerhound in England in a day or two &amp; I hope for good results.</p>
<p>The dog I allude to is a son of “Torrum” <hi rend="underline">the Champion</hi> &amp; the only one that has equalled his father in size.<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I have never seen deerhounds, but once, that equalled these dogs in size— I have lately had an old bitch poisoned—during the late election time!!<ref target="#foot.f11"/> &amp; have only my old wolf<hi rend="superscript">hd</hi>. Colin—the young black bitch &amp; her two pups by Colin. I still long for woolfhounds—but fear <hi rend="underline">alone</hi> I shall never breed them.</p>

<p rend="centre">Queries.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p> 
<p>(The following queries refer to live-stock or animals of all kinds; but dogs, and mor particularly Greyhounds, are specified because of the number of births at one time from a single mother, taken with the supposition that some sort of statistics can be got in connection with them.)</p>
<p>*1. Have any authentic cases been known—with Greyhounds, or any other dogs, or live-stock of any kind—where there seemed to be a tendency running in a <hi rend="underline">strain</hi> or family, to produce either <hi rend="underline">males</hi> or <hi rend="underline">females</hi> in excess. (N.B. Such cases occur with Short-horn cattle.)? * This query is of main importance.</p>
<p>Answer.</p>
<p>Have not noticed such in my experience.</p>
<p>2. Do such cases occur with individual brood-bitches (or brood-animals of any kind)?</p>
<p>Answer.</p>
<p>decidedly</p>
<p>3. In such cases—if occurring—is there any practice, as a rule in general, of preserving more of the young of one sex than of the other sex? Would more of the <hi rend="underline">females</hi> be destroyed than of the <hi rend="underline">males</hi> (or <hi rend="underline">vice</hi> <hi rend="underline">versa</hi>)—?</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Answer</hi>:</p>
<p>In my experience, a preponderance of males is kept.</p>
<p>4. Be so good as say (if the above is the case in your knowledge,) how many on an average you suppose would be preserved of <hi rend="underline">each</hi> <hi rend="underline">sex</hi>— for example in Greyhounds (or other dogs,) if a bitch produced 4 females &amp; 2 males at a litter, and another bitch produced 4 males and 2 females—? What would, generally speaking, be the proportion preserved of either sex?</p>
<p>Answer.</p>
<p>In this cases, equal—as a rule, &amp; where the n<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>. of puppies is large, ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. 3 males to 2 females w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be preserved, as far as I can personally vouch. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
<p>The above Answer runs thus (I write it out in a plainer hand so far as I can read it)</p> 
<p rend="centre">viz.</p> 
<p>In this case (or these cases?), equal (i.e. equal proportions? i. e. would be preserved?)— as a rule, and where the number of puppies is large, about 3 males to 2 females would be preserved, as far as I can personally vouch.</p>

<p>Your questions of Statistics I have sent to Sir W. Forbes–Bt—<ref target="#foot.f14"/> as my opinion you shall have also but with all humility as I realy dont know much about but as to deerhounds from my experience has been that Bitches have been more difficult to rear—and the general rule has been to preserve <hi rend="underline">males</hi> in preference to <hi rend="underline">females</hi> one or two at the <hi rend="underline">outside</hi> being kept only for Breeding purposes—</p>
<p>I also think within the last 80 years that Bitches were never hardly given away— as it was not desirable to extend the Breed and those who possessed them very unwilling to part with them— At the same time there are cases of some Bitches shewing more endurance &amp; pluck in the field— When Sir William sends answers I shall write again.</p>

See Robin Hood, ‘Master M’Grath’, <hi rend="italic">New Sporting Magazine</hi> n.s. 56 (1869): 129–32. Master McGrath lost only one of the thirty-seven course meetings he was entered in (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4675.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Leighton 1910</ref>, pp. 110–11).

In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1967.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Descent</hi> 2d ed.</ref>, p. 258 n. 99, CD considered whether the preponderance of male births in greyhounds without the systematic destruction of female puppies challenged Marshall’s view that a ‘male-producing race’ was the consequence of female infanticide. For CD’s evidence relating to greyhound-breeding practices, see the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9298.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from W. B. Tegetmeier, 17 February 1874</ref>, and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9309.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from George Cupples, 21 February 1874</ref> and enclosures.</note>
