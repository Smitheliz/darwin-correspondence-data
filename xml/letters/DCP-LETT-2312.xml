            <p>After all, CD is now beginning to prepare an abstract of his species theory. Recounts the events leading to joint paper with A. R. Wallace at Linnean Society. Lyell and Hooker urge strongly that he publish a fuller abstract. It is impossible to do justice to subject in an abstract.</p>
            <p>His sister, Marianne Parker, has died.</p>

<p>As you said you would like to hear how we were going on, I write to say thatwe are all very fairly well, &amp; after some house-hunting are settled here till next Tuesday when we go to Norfolk House Shanklin, where there is a single row of Houses on the Beach. This place has evidently sprung up like a mushroom; &amp; there are three hotels &amp; many villas. Years ago you took me across the isl<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. &amp; I have a great notion that the solitary sandy bay which I then saw must this be place.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It suits us very fairly &amp; the little Boys are very happy.</p>
<p>We have just heard of my sisters Marianne Parker’s death,—a blessed relief after long continued &amp; latterly very severe suffering.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> She was an admirable woman, &amp; I thank God is at rest. We are all here, but my eldest son starts in a week’s time abroad, for a little tour before going to old Christ College.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>After all, I am now beginning to prepare an abstract of my Species Theory. By an odd coincidence, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Wallace in the Malay Archipelago sent to me an Essay containing my exact theory; &amp; asking me to show it to Lyell. The latter &amp; Hooker have taken on themselves to publish it in Linnean Journal, together some notes of mine written very many years ago; &amp; both of them have urged me so strongly to publish a fuller abstract, that I have resolved to do it, &amp; shall do nothing till completed: it will be published, probably, in Journal of Linn. Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. &amp; I shall have separate copies &amp; will send you one.— It is impossible in abstract to do justice to subject.—</p>
<p>There has been another child die in village of Down; which makes the fifth; so we rejoice we acted on your advice &amp; left home.— We shall stay here to middle of August.—</p>
<p>With very sincere thanks for all your most kind sympathy. | My dear Fox | Yours most truly | C. Darwin</p>
