            <p>CD returns a letter from Wollaston.</p>
            <p>Although opposed to the Forbesian doctrine [of continental extension] as a general rule, CD would have no objection to its being proved in some cases.

            <p>His health is very poor and his "everlasting species-Book" quite overwhelms him with work. It is beyond his powers, but he hopes to live to finish it.</p>

<p>I have been particularly glad to see Wollaston’s letter.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> The news did not require any breaking to me; for though as a general rule I am much opposed to the Forbesian continental extensions, I have no objection whatever to its being proved in some cases. Not that I can admit that W. has by any means proved it; nor, I think, can anyone else, till we know something of the means of distribution of insects.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But the close similarity or identity of the two Faunas is certainly very interesting.— I am extremely glad to hear that your Madeira paper is making progress; &amp; I shall be most curious to see. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be infinitely obliged for a separate copy, whenever printed.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>My health has been very poor of late, &amp; I am going in a week’s time for a fortnight of hydropathy &amp; rest.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> My everlasting species-Book quite overwhelms me with work— It is beyond my powers, but I hope to live to finish it.—</p>
<p>Farewell | My dear Lyell | Ever yours | C. Darwin</p>

Having stated that the Coleoptera of Porto Santo and the Dezertas had more species in common than they did with Madeira as a whole, Wollaston wrote (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8454.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wollaston 1857</ref>, p. xv): <quote> And, without attempting to solve a geological problem, upon which Sir <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3051.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles Lyell</ref> will probably be able in a short time to throw considerable light, or to add any real evidence either in favour or against the existence of an ancient connective land; it does certainly appear to me, judging simply from Coleopterous data, as if the insect-population had possessed wonderful facilities, at some remote period, of migrating to and fro (as though along a slightly elevated mountain-ridge) between Porto Santo and the Dezertas, and in like manner … between the latter rocks and the eastern extremity of Madeira.</quote></note>
