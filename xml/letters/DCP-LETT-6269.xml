        <abstract> 
<p>Thanks AdeC for his long letter full of interesting facts, which will be of great use if a new edition [of <hi rend="italic">Variation</hi>] is demanded.</p>  
<p>As for when CD will publish on variation in a state of nature: he has had the MS almost ready for several years but <hi rend="italic">Variation</hi> fatigued him so much</p> 
            <p>that "I determined to amuse myself by publishing a short essay on the Descent of Man".</p> 
<p>AdeC will have plenty of time to publish his views. Asks permission to quote AdeC on a case of inheritance of scalp-muscles [see <hi rend="italic">Descent</hi> 1: 20].</p> 
            <p>Hooker has expressed a view, similar to AdeC’s, "that morals &amp; politics would be very interesting if discussed like any branch of Natural History".</p>
            <p>Agrees with AdeC on acclimatisation</p>
            <p>and on graft-hybrids.</p>
            <p>CD is repeating Hildebrand’s method in producing graft-hybrid potatoes.</p>
            <p>As for Pangenesis, very few people approve of it though it has some enthusiastic friends and CD has much faith in its vitality.</p>

                <div type="transcription">
                     
<p>I return you my <hi rend="underline">sincere</hi> thanks for your long letter, which I consider a great compliment, &amp; which is quite full of most interesting facts &amp; views.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Your references &amp; remarks will be of great use should a new edition of my book be demanded; but this is hardly probable, for the whole edition was sold within the first week, &amp; another large edtion immediately reprinted which I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> think w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> supply the demand forever.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> You ask me when I shall publish on the variation of species in a state of nature.</p>
<p>I have had the M.S. for another volume almost ready during several years, but I was so much fatigued by my last book that I determined to amuse myself by publishing a short essay on The Descent of Man. I was partly led to do this by having been taunted that I concealed my views, but chiefly from the interest which I had long taken in the subject. Now this essay has branched out into some collateral subjects &amp; I suppose will take me more than a year to complete.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I shall then begin on species, but my health makes me a very slow workman. I hope that you will excuse these details, which I have given to shew that you will have plenty of time to publish your views first, which will be a great advantage to me.</p>
<p>Of all the curious facts which you mention in your letter I think that of the strong inheritance of the scalp-muscles has interested me most. I presume that you w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not object to my giving this very curious case on your authority. As I believe all anatomists look at the scalp-muscles as remnant of the panniculus carnosus which is common to all the lower quadrupeds, I should look at the unusual development &amp; inheritance of these muscles as probably a case of reversion.<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>Your observation on so many remarkable men in noble families having been illegitimate is extremely curious; &amp; sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. I ever meet any one capable of writing an essay on this subject I will mention your remark as a good suggestion.</p>
<p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hooker has several times remarked to me that morals &amp; politics would be very interesting if discussed like any branch of Natural History, &amp; this is nearly to the same effect with your remarks.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I agree almost entirely with what you say on acclimatisation &amp; on graft hybrids; I never was more perplexed in my life than to come to any probable decision about Cytisus adami.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I suppose that you have seen the recent article in the Bot. Zeitung by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Hildebrand on graft hybrids in potatoes; this seems to me the best case yet recorded, &amp; I am repeating his method of trial this year.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>With respect to the hypothesis of Pangenesis very few persons approve of it, but it has some enthusiastic friends; nevertheless I am so presumptious as to have much faith in its vitality.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
<p>With Cordial thanks for your great kindness &amp; sincere respect, I remain, My dear Sir | Yours very faithfully &amp; obliged | Ch. Darwin</p>
