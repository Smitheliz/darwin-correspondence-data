<p>I should have written before had it not seemed doubtful whether you would go on to Teneriffe, but now I am extremely glad to hear your further progress is certain.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Not that I have much of any sort to say, as you may well believe, when you hear that I have only once been in London since you started. I was particularly glad to see two days since your letter to M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horner,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> with its geological news; how fortunate for you that your knees are recovered. I am astonished at what you say of the beauty, though I had fancied it great. It really makes me quite envious to think of you clambering up &amp; down those steep valleys. And what a pleasant party on every return from your expeditions. I often think of the delight which I felt when examining volcanic islands; &amp; I can remember even particular rocks which I struck—&amp; the smell of the hot, black, scoriaceous cliffs—but of these <hi rend="underline">hot</hi> smells, you do not seem to have had much.— I do quite envy you. How I should like to be with you, &amp; speculate on the deep &amp; narrow valleys.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>How very singular the fact is which you mention about the inclination of the strata being greater round the circumference than in the middle of the island: do you suppose the elevation has had the form of a flat dome:<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I remember in the Cordillera, being <hi rend="underline">often</hi> struck with the greater abruptness of the strata in the <hi rend="underline">low</hi>, <hi rend="underline">extreme</hi> outermost ranges, compared with the great mass of inner mountains.— I dare say you will have thought of measuring exactly the width of any dikes, at top &amp; bottom of any great cliff, (which was done by M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Seale<ref target="#foot.f5"/> at St. Helena) for it has often struck me as <hi rend="underline">very odd</hi>, that the cracks did not die out <hi rend="underline">oftener</hi> upwards.—</p>
<p>I can think of hardly any news to tell you, as I have seen no one, since being in London, where I was delighted to see Forbes<ref target="#foot.f6"/> looking so well, quite big &amp; burly. I saw at the Museum<ref target="#foot.f7"/> some of the surprisingly rich Gold Ore from N. Wales:<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Ramsay, also, told me, that he has lately turned a good deal of New Red S. into Permian, together with the Labyrinthodon.—<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>No doubt you see newspapers &amp; know that E. de Beaumont is perpetual Secretary,<ref target="#foot.f10"/> &amp; I suppose will be more powerful than ever; &amp; Le Verrier has Arago’s place in the Observatory.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> There was a meeting lately at the Geolog. Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>, at which Prestwich,<ref target="#foot.f12"/> (judging from what R. Jones,<ref target="#foot.f13"/> told me) brought forward <hi rend="doubleUnderline">your</hi> exact theory,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> viz that the whole red clay &amp; flints over the Chalk-plateau hereabout is the residuum from slow dissolution of the chalk!</p>
<p>As regards ourselves, we have no news, &amp; are all well. The Hookers, sometime ago staid a fortnight with us, &amp; to our extreme delight, Henslow came down, &amp; was most quiet &amp; comfortable here. It does one good to see so composed, benevolent &amp; intellectual a countenance. There have been great fears that his heart is affected; but I hope to God without foundation. Hooker’s book is out, &amp; <hi rend="underline">most beautifully</hi> got up.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> He has honoured me beyond measure, by dedicating it to me! As for myself, I am got to the p. 112 of the Barnacles,<ref target="#foot.f16"/> &amp; that is the sum total of my History. By the way, as you care so much about N. America, I may mention that I had a long letter from a ship-mate in Australia,<ref target="#foot.f17"/> who says the Colony is getting decidedly republican, from the influx of Americans, &amp; that all the great &amp; novel schemes for working the Gold are planned &amp; executed by these men.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> What a go-a head nation it is.—</p>
<p>Give our kindest remembrances to Lady Lyell and to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Bunbury &amp; to Bunbury. I most heartily wish that the Canaries may be 10 times as interesting as Madeira, &amp; that everything may go on most prosperously with your whole party.</p>
<p>My dear Lyell, your’s most truly &amp; affectionately | C. Darwin.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">Lyell had left London in December 1853 for a geological tour of Madeira with wife Mary and her sister, Frances, and Frances’s husband <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_722.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Charles James Fox Bunbury</ref> (F. J. Bunbury ed. 1891–3, <hi rend="italic">Middle life</hi> 2: 161; K. M. Lyell ed. 1881, 2: 176). The party went on to visit the Canary Islands in February 1854, returning to England in April.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f3">In the letter, Lyell referred to CD stating that: ‘In general this island confirms his doctrine, that if all valleys were cut by rivers alone, they would be very narrow, though they might be of any depth, and that the sea is the great widening power’ (K. M. Lyell ed. 1881, 2: 192).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Lyell did believe there had been an ‘original flattened dome’ that during elevation had acquired a more convex form (K. M. Lyell ed. 1881, 2: 192). A later <ref target="" resp="#automat">letter to Horner, 21 February 1854</ref> (<hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>., pp. 193–6), contains more information about the geology of the island and Lyell’s reasons for concluding that its volcanic formation was ‘sub-aerial’.</note>
