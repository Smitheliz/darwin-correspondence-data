                    <p>When D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Eras: Darwin died, he appears to have left no money to D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Robert Darwin who was the sole surviving issue of his first marriage with Miss Howard, but to have bequeathed the whole to the issue of his second marriage, with M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Poole, by whom he left six children all under age, and to two illegitimate daughters M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. H. &amp; Miss P.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> This seemed unfair, and to have created some soreness on the part of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Robert D.— What may be pleaded in extenuation is this.</p>
<p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Robert D. w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have the whole of the fortune that was settled on his mother at her marriage who it is believed was wealthy</p>
                    <p>He had marrried early in life (æt 24 about) a lady of considerable fortune for those days, viz it is said £ 30.000.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> On the other hand, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Erasmus Darwin left comparatively very little money &amp; a very large young family. He was able only to leave £3000 for certain, to each of his six children by his second marriage, plus a share in what he then thought a hopeless debt to him, by a M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Archdale<ref target="#foot.f3"/> (? who was she); which however was ultimately paid and yielded £3000 more to each. His widow, formerly M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Poole, had of her own a jointure for her life only, of £800 a year,— together with a house, for a time, and it is supposed that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. E. Darwin was enabled to save what he did by living chiefly on this jointure, so that the money bequeathed to the second family may fairly be considered as capitalised from the jointure of their mother, &amp; therefore justly their own.</p>
<p>If it c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. be shewn that D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Robert D’s fortune through <hi rend="underline">his</hi> mother was not less than £3000 there would appear to remain no fair cause of complaint so far as the <hi rend="underline">bequests</hi> are concerned.</p>
                    <p>As regards the giving no money to him D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. R. D when he first settled at Shrewsbury;—that is another matter about which I can learn nothing new<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
                    <p>F. Galton</p>
                    <p>June 9/79.</p>
                    <p>1st<hi rend="superscript">ly</hi>.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Eras: Darwin (neé Collier) had a jointure f<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>. Pole of £800 a year I think it was— Also Radbourne House, till her Son, Sacheverell Pole came of age.</p>
                    <p>She had 3. Children—Sacheverell—Eliz<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. who married Col<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>. Bramley &amp; Millicent—who married the Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> John Gisborne—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
                    <p>2nd<hi rend="superscript">ly</hi></p>
                    <p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. E Darwin lived at Radbourne after his marriage to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Pole Edw<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. was born there—&amp; Violetta. He then found Radbourne too far off f<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. his medical practice—that he went to live at Derby, &amp; Radbourne was let—till M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Pole was of age—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Erasmus Darwin having £800-a year, besides the rent of Radbourne House—whilst her son M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Pole was under age—£800-a year, (then going much further in those days,) would be able to pay all Household Expences—&amp; the D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. could save all his earnings for the 21. years of married life—It would amount to £16,800—besides the Radbourne Let</p>
                    <p>3<hi rend="superscript">rdly</hi>.</p>
                    <p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Eras: Darwin has to educate &amp; place out at Ashbourne, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Hadley &amp; Mary Parker—&amp; probably pay a sum to their Mother, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Day—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>4<hi rend="superscript">thly</hi>.—</p>
<p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. E Darwin lent several thousands, or I think there was an Insurance on M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Archdall’s life—but it was feared, he would never get the money—but if ever paid—that money was left in his will to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Era<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. Darwin, (his 2<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi>. Wife) &amp; her Children—&amp; it was rep<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. after M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Archdall’s death.</p>
<p>5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. When D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. E Darwin died—he left by his second marriage 6. Children Edw<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. was nearly of age—Sach.<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> Francis ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. 15—John much younger Violetta 19. Emma 17. Harriet—ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. 12.</p>
<p>Each of these children, on attaining the age of 21. was to have £3,000— All the three Son’s education was sadly neglected— They were sent to cheap Schools in Derby—&amp; their Father never attended to their education—so they were hardly fitted for any Profession—</p>
<p>If the Archdall money was ever p<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin was to have it, &amp; the second family at M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin’s death—&amp; so they did receive f<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. 5 to £6,000—each f<hi rend="superscript">m</hi>. first to last—</p>
                    <p>Had M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Eras<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. Darwin died soon after her Husband—the Pole Jointure wd. have ceased at once—&amp; the second family have the interest of £3,000 each, to educate &amp; maintain themselves—unless M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Archdall’s money cd. be paid which was very uncertain—</p>
                    <p>Old M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin of Elston—left his Property—some to his Heir William Darwin—&amp; some to the <hi rend="underline">issue</hi> of his (M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin’s) youngest Brother D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Eras. Darwin—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
                    <p>Did Issue mean, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Eras Darwin’s children—or children &amp; grandchildren— This much excited Emma Darwin—as D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Rob<hi rend="superscript">et</hi>. had 6. children—&amp; Violetta Galton also 6— So there was an amicable lawsuit—as 12. extra claimants must much lessen the sum received—The Chancellor decided against the grandchildren<ref target="#foot.f9"/></p>
<p>M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin had only 2 children living at her death Violetta &amp; Francis-Sacheverell</p>
