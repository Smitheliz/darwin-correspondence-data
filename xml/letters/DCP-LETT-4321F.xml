                        <p>I write by my husband’s desire to thank you for your very interesting letter. I am sorry to say that he is now so unwell as to be unable to attend to any observations or work of any kind— He is very much interested by the account you give of the inherited variations &amp; the proportion of them &amp; the fact of the frequent occurrence of these variations in one locality is very curious.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He has heard of facts somewhat analogous to these. He begs me to thank you for the honour you have done him &amp; to say what a pleasure it would have been to have seen these varied plants if his health had permitted him to accept your very kind invitation</p>
