<p>I received Henslow’s letter last night too late to forward it to you by the post, a circumstance which I do not regret, as it has given me an opportunity of seeing Captain Beaufort at the admiralty (the Hydrographer) &amp; of stating to him the offer which I have to make to you: he entirely approves of it &amp; you may consider the situation as at your absolute disposal: I trust that you will accept it as it is an opportunity which should not be lost &amp; I look forward with great interest to the benefit which our collections of natural history may receive from your labours</p>
<p>The circumstances are these</p>
<p>Captain Fitzroy (a nephew of the Duke of Graftons) sails at the end of September in a ship to survey in the first instance the S. Coast of Terra del Fuego, afterwards to visit the South Sea Islands &amp; to return by the Indian Archipelago to England: The expedition is entirely for scientific purposes &amp; the ship will generally wait your leisure for researches in natural history &amp;c: Captain Fitzroy is a public spirited &amp; zealous officer, of delightful manners &amp; greatly beloved by all his brother officers: he went with Captain Beechey<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; spent 1500£ in bringing over &amp; educating at his own charge 3 natives of Patagonia:<ref target="#foot.f2"/> he engages at his own expense an artist at 200 a year to go with him: you may be sure therefore of having a very pleasant companion, who will enter heartily into all your views</p>
<p>The ship sails about the end of September &amp; you must lose no time in making known your acceptance to Captain Beaufort, Admiralty hyd<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> I have had a good deal of correspondence about this matter, who<ref target="#foot.f3"/> feels in common with myself the greatest anxiety that you should go. I hope that no other arrangements are likely to interfere with it</p>
<p>Captain will give you the rendezvous &amp; all requisite information: I should recommend you to come up to London, in order to see him &amp; to complete your arrangements I shall leave London on Monday: perhaps you will have the goodness to write to me at Denton, Darlington, to say that you will go</p>
<p>The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish you with an official appointment<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; every accomodation: if a salary should be required however I am inclined to think that it would be granted</p>
<p>Believe me | My dear Sir | Very truly yours | Geo Peacock</p>
<p>If you are with Sedgwick I hope you will give my kind regards to him</p>

FitzRoy’s original plan was to fulfil a commitment to return the Fuegians to their native land; he had already chartered a small vessel for the voyage when an uncle obtained for him the appointment to survey the southern coasts of South America.
