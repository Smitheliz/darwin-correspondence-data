            <p>Asks JM’s opinion on publishing his MS on orchids. It has new facts, and resembles a Bridgewater Treatise, but only those who care for natural history would be interested. Would share the risk.</p>

<p>Will you have the kindness to give me your opinion, which I shall implicitly follow.— I have just finished a very long paper intended for Linn. Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. (the title is enclosed)<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; yesterday for the first time it occurred to me that <hi rend="doubleUnderline">possibly</hi> it might be worth publishing separately, which would save me trouble &amp; delay.— The facts are new &amp; have been collected during 20 years &amp; strike me as curious.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Like a Bridge-water Treatise the chief object is to show the perfection of the many contrivances in Orchids.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The subject of propagation is interesting to most people, &amp; is treated in my paper so that any woman could read it. Parts are dry &amp; purely scientific: but I think my paper would interest a good many of such persons who care for Nat. History, <hi rend="doubleUnderline">but no others</hi>. In a few days an artist is coming here to make from 20–30 small woodcuts.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>As far as I can calculate the paper contains about 29,000 words; in small page <hi rend="underline">with rather open type</hi>, about 205 words to page, I calculate the matter would make 131 page, but with division into chapter say <hi rend="underline">at most</hi> 135 pages. So it would be a very little Book, &amp; I believe you think very little books objectionable. I have myself <hi rend="doubleUnderline">great</hi> doubts on subject. I am very apt to think that my Geese are Swans; but the subject seems to me curious &amp; interesting.</p>
<p>I <hi rend="doubleUnderline">beg</hi> you not to be guided in the least in order to oblige me, but as far as you can judge, please give me your opinion.— If I were to publish separately, I would agree to any terms, such as half risk &amp; half profit, or what you liked; but I would not publish on my sole risk, for to be frank, I have been told that no Publisher whatever, under such circumstances cares for success of Book.— I would pay myself for all drawing on the wood, but not for cutting.— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. send <hi rend="underline">rough M.S</hi> to be printed on Slips &amp; would pay for extra corrections.— I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> require &amp; pay for 30 or 40 copies.— But if this little Book were to fail, it occurs to me that it might injure sale of my future larger Books.— In fact I am utterly in doubt.— Please give me your impression.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD began preparing his manuscript on the pollinating mechanisms of various species of orchids during his stay in Torquay in July and August (see ‘Journal’; Appendix II). As he states, he had always envisioned publishing the work in one of the journals of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2944.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Linnean Society</ref> of London.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">CD described the history of his study of orchids in his <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_261.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi></ref>, p. 127: <quote type="quote"> During the summer of 1839, and, I believe, during the previous summer, I was led to attend to the cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects, from having come to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of species, that crossing played an important part in keeping specific forms constant. I attended to the subject more or less during every subsequent summer; and my interest in it was greatly enhanced by having procured and read in November 1841, through the advice of Robert Brown, a copy of C. K. Sprengel’s wonderful book, <hi rend="italic">Das entdeckte Geheimniss der Natur</hi>. </quote> CD’s annotated copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7390.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Sprengel 1793</ref>, dated August 1841, is in the Darwin Library–CUL. Michael Ghiselin points out that the account given above overlooks CD’s earlier interest in pollination biology that was perhaps stimulated by his reading of Erasmus Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Botanic garden</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1789.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">E. Darwin 1789–91</ref>). See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2829.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ghiselin 1984</ref>, pp. xvii–xviii.

According to Egerton’s stipulations, each author was to write and publish a treatise ‘On the power, wisdom and goodness of God, as manifested in the creation’. Several of the volumes became classic works in the apologetic writings of natural theology (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2248.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">EB</hi></ref>; see also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7783.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Topham 1993</ref>).
