        <abstract> 
<p>Thanks GA for his article ["The daisy’s pedigree", <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Mag.</hi> 44 (1881): 168–81].</p> 
            <p>The evolutionary argument that petals are transformed stamens is "striking and apparently valid". Doubts petals are naturally yellow.</p>
            <p>Wallace’s "generalization about much modified parts being splendidly coloured" is also dubious except as both are caused by sexual selection.</p>

                    <p>I thank you for sending me the Cornhill, as your article has interested me much.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Many years ago I thought it highly probable that petals were in all cases transformed stamens. I forget (excepting the water-lily) what made me think so; but I am sure that your evolutionary argument never occurred to me, as it is too striking &amp; apparently valid ever to be forgotten.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
                    <p>I cannot help doubting about petals being naturally yellow: I speak only from vague memory, but I think that the filaments are generally white or almost white, &amp; surely it is the filament which is developed into the petal.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I remember some fine purple &amp; bright yellow filaments, but these seemed to me to serve by adding colour to the whole flower. Is it not the pollen alone which renders most stamens yellow at a cursory glance? You may possibly like to hear that I have described cases (&amp; others have been described) when an <hi rend="underline">excessively</hi> poor soil has rendered a flower double. I can hardly doubt that any great change of conditions (which has so strong a tendency to cause sterility) tends to render a flower double.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Close interbreeding has a slight tendency in this direction, as has according Gärtner, a hybrid origin.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>With many thanks for the pleasure which your article has given me, I remain | Yours sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
                    <p>I suppose that you know H. Müllers Alpen-Blumen, as it contains much about colour of flowers &amp; orders of visting insects.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I much doubt Wallace’s generalisation about much modified parts being splendidly coloured, except in so far that both have been acted on by the same cause, viz sexual selection.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
                    <p>That is an excellent case in the Voyage of the Vega, which I am reading, but have not yet got so far.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> In former times it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. have been worth its weight in gold to me.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The letter from Allen has not been found. He sent his article ‘The daisy’s pedigree’, which appeared in the August 1881 issue of <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11536.xml">Allen 1881</ref>).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Allen wrote: ‘petals … are merely specialised stamens, which have given up their original function of forming pollen, in order to adopt the function of attracting insects’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11536.xml">Allen 1881</ref>, p. 175). </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Allen claimed that the inner florets of the daisy evolved through a flattening and lengthening of the yellow corolla, and that the first rays or petals would also have been yellow (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11536.xml">Allen 1881</ref>, p. 180). CD briefly discussed petaloid stamens (or filaments) in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref>, pp. 294 and 303, noting that in the Marantaceae, even fertile stamens are sometimes petaloid.
