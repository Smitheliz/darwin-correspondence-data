<p>Many thanks for your letter,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> which I waited to answer until we should be here— I can now tell you that we accomplished the journey very successfully in two days, passing the first night at Derby, &amp; arriving here yesterday— We are at present located in a boarding house, but we do not like it, &amp; are going out this morning to look for lodgings— The noise &amp; publicity does not suit Joseph, &amp; he was very tired last night—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> However he is really wonderfully better, &amp; beginning to walk about comfortably—but he is still very stiff in his joints, &amp; can only move slowly— It is horribly cold here, but I suppose we shall get used to that in time—but it is a great contrast to Notting Hill—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Tyndall, who was at Birmingham, told us that so far from Lady Lubbock having kept her room, she was sitting in the sections all Monday!— the accident having happened on Saturday—<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Joseph has read Phillips’ address,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> &amp; thought it in matter extremely washy, but no doubt as delivered, was very well suited to the occasion— He was astonished at no allusion whatever being made to Sir J. Lubbock’s book.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>With Joseph’s love, | I am | Yours affect<hi rend="superscript">ly</hi>. | F H Hooker</p>
<p>Have you read Geikie’s book on Scotland?<ref target="#foot.f8"/> Joseph was pleased with parts, but disappointed on the whole.</p>
