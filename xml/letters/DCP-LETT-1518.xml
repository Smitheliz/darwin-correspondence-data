<p>I was in London for the last Geological,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> &amp; found at my Brother’s two pamphlets from you, one <hi rend="underline">most useful</hi> to me, &amp; a packet of Maple Sugar for Lizzie, which pleased her much; &amp; by a great effort she agreed to send you her many thanks;—poor little dear, graciosity, as yet, is not her forte.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I make the above facts an excuse for writing to you, for I have very little to say. I was extremely sorry to hear of the delay in the opening of the Exhibition;<ref target="#foot.f3"/> but I hope it will not interfere with the Canary Islands.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I went up for a Paper by the Arctic D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Sutherland on ice-action, read only in abstract, but I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think with much good matter.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It was very pleasant to hear, that it was written owing to the admiralty manual.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> There was also a paper by Trimmer partly on the superficial deposits of Kent,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Murchison urged his catastrophe view to account for the flints,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> so I gave your view of sub-glacial action &amp; urged where on earth the flood, which divided France &amp; England, could have found so vast a pile of almost clean flints. I stated that one of the arctic navigators, had informed you that the stones on the beach were angular in those countries: &amp; on this head I asked D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.. Sutherland, &amp; he <hi rend="underline">most strongly confirmed</hi> this statement; &amp; I thought you would like to hear this.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> Hopkins<ref target="#foot.f10"/> spoke, he admitted to a considerable extent, the force of my notion of (plastic) icebergs being driven by their momentum over considerable inequalities in an almost straight course.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> Chambers also spoke at length: Have you seen his long &amp; I must say interesting Paper on glaciation in Eding. New. Phil Journal: he actually reproduces Agassiz’s notion of one continuous sheet of ice over the whole northern world, &amp; treats all Icebergians with the most supercilious contempt.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>I do not know whether you will care to hear the above Report of our meeting; but I do not at all expect you to answer this.—</p>
<p>I did not stay for the battle royal at the Royal Soc<hi rend="superscript">y</hi>. but I see Murchison &amp; Beaufort gained the day, &amp; Capt Inglefield was elected making one more than the proper number of admissions.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p>We are all well: I am alone at present; Emma having gone for a few days to her sisters.<ref target="#foot.f14"/> On July 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. we go for a month, the whole posse comitatus of us, to the Isle of Wight:<ref target="#foot.f15"/> &amp; on our return I hope to go to press with my weariful cirripedes.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Elizabeth Darwin, nearly 6 years old, was slow in developing as a child and was not able to live a fully independent adult life. Very little is known about her, but in the notebook in which observations on the Darwin children are recorded, Emma noted that Elizabeth’s speech at 4<formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> years old was confused; her pronunciation was strange and her phraseology peculiar. By the time she was 5 years old, she had developed ‘a great habit of abstraction going by herself &amp; talking to herself for an hour. She does not like to be interrupted’. (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 4, Appendix III, MS pp. 42–42v.) In his <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1474.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to W. E. Darwin, 24 [February 1852]</ref>, CD reported that Elizabeth ‘shivers &amp; makes as many extraordinary grimaces as ever’. Elizabeth lived with CD and Emma in Down and, after CD’s death, remained with Emma in Cambridge and Down (Wedgwood and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8245.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Wedgwood 1980</ref>, pp. 321–2; <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2337.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Emma Darwin</hi> (1904)</ref>, p. 338). Following Emma’s death, she settled in Cambridge. Her sister Henrietta Litchfield, included letters concerning Elizabeth’s voluntary work in 1891 at the infirmary of the workhouse in Cambridge in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2337.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Emma Darwin</hi> (1904)</ref>, 2: 404–5. In the later edition of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2338.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Emma Darwin</hi> (1915)</ref>, she noted only Elizabeth’s birth. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3942.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gwen Raverat</ref>, CD’s granddaughter, who knew Elizabeth towards the end of her life in the 1920s, observed: ‘She was not good at practical things … and she could not have managed her own life without a little help and direction now and then; but she was shrewd enough in her own way, and a very good judge of character.’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6547.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Raverat 1952</ref>, pp. 146–7). See also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1784.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Darwin 1955</ref>, pp. 58–9.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Lyell, a permanent member of the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, had been asked by the Government to represent science at the New York Industrial Exhibition of 1853 (K. M. Lyell ed. 1881, 2: 187–8). This letter is addressed to Lyell as ‘Commissioner to the Great Exhibition | New York | U.S.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Lyell intended to visit the islands in the autumn of 1853 (K. M. Lyell ed. 1881, 2: 188). However, the trip was not made until February 1854 (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1542.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter to J. D. Dana, 6 December [1853]</ref>, n. 13).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f9">According to Lyell (and CD), flints and erratic boulders were dropped by icebergs or by local glaciers: flints transported by floods or by surf action on beaches would be rounded. For Murchison’s argument against the agency of ice in the formation of the drift deposits, see Murchison 1851, p. 395. The angular nature of the flints, according to Murchison, indicated ‘a much greater intensity of fracture in former stages of the planet than now’ and that ‘such dislocations must have been accompanied by torrents of water’; ‘ordinary tidal action’, he argued, would have produced ‘water-worn pebbles’ (Murchison 1851, p. 394).</note>
