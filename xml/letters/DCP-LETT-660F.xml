                        <p>They are such as cannot possibly be injured if moderate care be taken of them   Would you be so kind as respectfully lay the request before the Trustees &amp; state how much obliged I should feel if they would permit Mr Lyell to have the use of these specimens for a fort night or three weeks during his lectures<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>

The specimens had been collected from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, in the Indian Ocean, in 1836, during the <hi rend="italic">Beagle</hi> voyage, and were registered in the collection on 14 December 1842 (Rosen and Darrell 2011, p 173). For a list of the specimens, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11738.xml">Rosen and Darrell 2011</ref>, pp. 195–7.</note>

The second lecture was on coral reefs; a brief summary of the lecture mentioned Lyell’s discussion of the manner in which coral reefs were raised and of the zoophytes from which they were constituted, but no specimens were mentioned in the report (<hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>, 9 March 1843, p. 5; 11 March 1843, p. 6).</note>
