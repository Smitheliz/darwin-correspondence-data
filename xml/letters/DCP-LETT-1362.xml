<p>I am very much obliged for your juicy, as my poor dear Father used to call an interesting, letter.— We were very glad to get the sentence about Bruce Castle school, for we are still in an awesome state of indecision between Rugby &amp; it.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I knew you were just the man to apply to to get information upon any out of the way subject.— We have taken much pains in making enquiries, &amp; upon the whole the balance is decidedly favourable; yet there is so much novelty in the system that we cannot help being much afraid at trying an experiment on so important a subject. At Bruce castle, they do not begin Latin, till a Boy can read, write, spell, &amp; count <hi rend="underline">well</hi>: they have no punishments except stopping premiums on good behaviour. I do not see how we are ever to come to a decision; but we must soon.— Willy is 11 this coming Christmas, &amp; backward for his age; though sensible &amp; observant. I rather think we shall send him to Bruce C. School.—<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Your own system of Education sounds <hi rend="doubleUnderline">capital</hi>, &amp; why you sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. think I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. laugh at it, I cannot conceive: I believe a good deal of diversity an immense advantage. It is one good point at Bruce Castle: that no one subject exceeds an hour &amp; if a Boy can do it quicker, he may go out before the hour is over.—</p>
<p>You say you are teaching riding: we have been teaching Willy &amp; we began without stirrrups, &amp; in consequence Willy got two <hi rend="underline">severe</hi> falls, one almost serious; so we are thinking of giving him stirrups; more especially as I am assured, that a Boy who rides well without stirrups has almost to begin again when he takes to stirrups: Can you give me any wisdom on this head; pray do if you can?—</p>
<p>I never heard anything half so wonderful as your stock of cows, pigs horses &amp; children: well might Sir Philip tell me it was marvellous what your farm did.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> How earnestly I wish we were nearer to each other: I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. beyond measure like to see your Noahs ark: next summer I will really try to pay you a visit of a few days.— I fear Emma will not be able, for about midsummer we expect our 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> arrival, &amp; then we shall have, as it may be said, almost four babies of the same age.— I often speculate how wise it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be to start off to Australia, or what I fancy most, the middle States of N. America.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>You ask after my Pear trees; those against the wall continue to bear <hi rend="underline">very well</hi> for young trees; but my standards have not borne at all; &amp; I doubt whether the besom system of tying up, answers for them.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I have planted my Rivers Quince Dwarfs, which I got on your recommendation.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Whenever you can do pray pay us a visit even for one day.—</p>
<p>Susan &amp; Catherine’s tour answered capitally</p>
<p>Yours affectionately | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Do you intend to educate your Boys altogether at home?— The first-rate tutor<ref target="#foot.f7"/> at whom Willy now is, teaches nothing on earth but the Latin Grammar, &amp; his charge is 150£ per annum! Bruce Castle is cheap <hi rend="underline">with extras</hi> about 80£.</p>
<p>Adios</p>
<p>Have you any curiosity to read a pamphlet descriptive of Bruce Castle?—<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>
