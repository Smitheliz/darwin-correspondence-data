<p>I am very much obliged for your information in regard to the association, about which I feel a great interest.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It seems to me highly desirable that the association should include as many medical and scientific men as possible throughout the whole country, who could illumine those capable of illumination on the necessity of physiological research; but that the Assoc<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. should be governed by a Council of powerful men not too many in number— Such a council as representing a large body of medical men would have more power in the eyes of vote=hunting politicians than a small body representing only themselves—</p>
<p>From what I see of country practitioners, I thinks that their annual subscription ought to be very small— But would it not be possible to add to the rules <hi rend="underline">some</hi> <hi rend="underline">such</hi> statement as the following one:— “That by a donation of £.... or of any larger sum from those who feel a deep interest in the progress of medical science, the donor shall become a life member”. I for one would gladly subscribe £50 or £100— If such a plan were approved by the leading medical men of London two or three thousand pounds might at once be collected; and if any such sum could be announced as already subscribed when the programme of the Assoc<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. is put forth, it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> have, as I believe, a considerable influence on the country, &amp; would attract the attention of country practitioners. The Anti-corn Law League owed much of its enormous power to several wealthy men laying down £1000;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> for the subscription of a good sum of money is the best proof of earnest conviction— you asked for my opinion on the above points, and I have given it freely, though well aware that from living so retired a life my judgement cannot be worth much. Have you read M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gurney’s article in the Fortnightly and Cornhill?<ref target="#foot.f3"/> They seem to me very clever though obscurely written; &amp; I agree with almost everything that he says, except with some passages which appear to imply that no experiments sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be tried, unless some immediate good can be predicted, &amp; this is a gigantic mistake contradicted by the whole history of science—</p>
<p>Believe me dear D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Brunton | Yours very sincerely | Ch. Darwin</p>
<p>P.S. | That is a curious fact about babies; I remember hearing on good authority that very young babies when moved are apt to clutch hold of anything, &amp; I thought of your explanation; but your case during sleep is a much more interesting one.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Very many thanks for the book which I much wanted to see; it will be sent back to-day, as from you, to the Society.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
