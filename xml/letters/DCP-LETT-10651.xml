<p>My first letter was written before leaving home for my friend’s house and the station &amp; posted on my way before seeing the sundews, which I found to my great astonishment were rotting away from below upwards.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Instead therefore of sending them by railway as was my intention when I wrote the said letter; we at once decided that it would be better to forward them by post, feeling sure that you would receive them sooner. The pieces still remaining green have been placed in a small collecting case, which I trust you will receive to-morrow. The rapid change is probably to be accounted for as follows. By special invitation, twice repeated, I took the specimens to the Conversazione of the Social Science Congress at Liverpool on Tuesday Ev<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>. last.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> On returning the following morning the plants were put back into the fern case and appeared healthy. Circumstances prevented my seeing them again until to-day and you may imagine my surprise &amp; disappointment at seeing them in the condition named above. I trust however that there is still sufficient for purposes of examination. You will observe the buds on two of the detached leaves— The old leaf to which I referred had completely gone.</p>

<p>The chief specimen consists of a decayed root-stock with an undoubted Drosera leaf still attached to it. A small abnormal plant is attached by a half-decayed stalk to the upper part of the root stock. This little plant consists of an axis <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> inch long having about 12 leaves coming off successively. The leaves are of peculiar shape with broad petioles &amp; dwarfed laminæ. The largest is about <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> in long &amp; the lamina is <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>10</mn></mfrac></math></formula><hi rend="superscript">th</hi> inch in biggest diameter. The leaves have very minute, aborted tentacles. The little plant does not seem to have grown out of the disc of a normal leaf; its axis is simply continued into the stalk connecting it with the parent. The connecting stalk is broad like a petiole, so it is just possible that the little plant did grow originally from the disc of a leaf &amp; all traces of this leaf have decayed away— There is another abnormal plant quite separate. There are also two leaves with young plants budding from their discs. Two leaves with rudimentary tentacles—</p>
