<p>Knowing that you are engaged in researches on the influence of domestication on the external form and characteristics of animals, I take the liberty of inclosing a stuffed specimen of an albino sparrow from Japan, which I begged the other day from an acquaintance, in whose possession it had died.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I cannot say whether, the skeleton being absent, it is of the slightest use or interest to you, but I send it on the chance that it may prove so. I have seen several very curiously marked &amp; colored Japanese sparrows, but they are very rare here, in the south of China, &amp; I cannot procure any for transmission to you, nor do I think they would get home alive, unless very great care were taken of them, for they seem delicate in constitution, from what I can learn. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Swinhoe<ref target="#foot.f2"/> told me that the So. China sparrow is <hi rend="underline">Passer montanus</hi>. I am no zoologist myself, &amp; do not pretend to know whether the specimen sent &amp; the others I have referred to are <hi rend="underline">sports</hi> of that species or not, but the Japanese are such adepts at raising vegetable monsters that they are not unlikely to have outrun us in propagating &amp; perpetuating animal races too.</p>
<p>It is not likely that you have heard my name, though I have for many years past worked steadily at the Flora of China; but a quiet student, who writes little, &amp; is located in so distant &amp; isolated a place can of course expect no other lot.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I take advantage of this opportunity to say that an old friend of mine, Edw. Bradford, a <hi rend="underline">Linnaean</hi>, formerly Princ: Med: Officer in the Hongkong Garrison, &amp; now head of the medical staff at Sandhurst, who was stationed for some time at Dominica &amp; Trinidad,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> where he worked hard at Orchids, <hi rend="underline">con amore</hi>, &amp; with great skill too, &amp; from whom I was so fortunate as to receive a number of specimens, wrote to me very lately, <hi rend="underline">‘a propos</hi> of your suggestion (: Fertil. of Orch. p. 236:) that <hi rend="underline">Catasetum tridentatum</hi> was ♂,<ref target="#foot.f5"/> to say that he felt sure he had collected perfect fruit from it in Trinidad! This was about 17 years ago, but his memory was not treacherous, for I found on referring to my herbarium (which I did at his request) a fine full capsule, of which I have sent him a sketch—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Thus, your supposition is unfounded.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I have mentioned this, because I feel sure it is a fact which will greatly interest you; but, while doing so, I desire to explain in the most explicit manner that the discovery &amp; all the credit pertaining thereto are <hi rend="underline">Mr. Bradford’s</hi>, <hi rend="doubleUnderline">not</hi> <hi rend="underline">mine</hi>.</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">The sketch by Hance was enclosed with the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4259.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from Edward Bradford, 31 July 1863</ref>.</note>
