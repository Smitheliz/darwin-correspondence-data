                    <salute>Dear M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Darwin,</salute>
                </opener>
                <div type="transcription">
                     
                    <p>It is all right as far as regards M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wallace himself—</p>
                    <p>I told him that you &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Huxley thought him entitled to a Gov<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. pension <hi rend="underline">if</hi> it could be got—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> At first he hesitated but when I represented that such men as Joule &amp; Faraday had received it<ref target="#foot.f2"/> he said “I confess it would be a <hi rend="underline">very great relief</hi> to me and if such men as Darwin &amp; Huxley think I may accept it it suppose I may”—adding “I really have some claim, for most naturalists &amp; travellers on their return from a foreign country have been given some post, &amp; I have tried for one in vain”.</p>
<p>It seems some friend suggested it to him some time ago but he rejected the idea; but now that it comes from men like yourself &amp; Huxley who can appreciate his work it makes a difference—</p>
                    <p>I could not get the memorial lists but when I said that you would have only a few good names &amp; suggested the Duke of Argyll,<ref target="#foot.f3"/> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wallace said he is just the man who would probably give his name with pleasure—</p>
<p>He quite understands that the result is very doubtful &amp; indeed he said very little about it, for when I had once ascertained his views I did not want to lead him to dwell upon it—</p>
                    <p>I have nothing I think to add to the notes I gave you.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I enclose a very brief statement which may be of some use, though of the real value of his work you can speak best—</p>
<p>From my short conversation yesterday I am more than ever sure that your generous efforts if they succeed will really confer a great boon on M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Wallace &amp; relieve him of anxiety—</p>
<p>If I can look out anything more for you please let me know—</p>
                    <p>With kind remembrances to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Darwin | Yours very sincerely | Arabella B Buckley</p>

              <p>He gave up his profession of surveyor &amp; architect from pure love of Natural History &amp; depended entirely on his collections for his remuneration— The loss of these collections sent him to the Malay 〈archipelago〉 &amp; on his return from there in 1862 he began at once to try for some post as naturalist &amp; curator—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The East London Museum was as nearly promised to him as was possible before the building was concluded, &amp; the loan of Sir R Wallace’s pictures giving a new turn to the use of the building threw him out—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> His failure with regard to Epping Forest<ref target="#foot.f7"/> &amp; other appointments has led him to give up all idea at his age of obtaining a post— Want of success in some investments has diminished his income &amp; he is dependent now <hi rend="underline">chiefly</hi> on his writings which are (not very) remunerative in an inverse ratio to their true value—</p>
              <p>His chief claims seem to be</p>
