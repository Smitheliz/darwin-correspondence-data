<p>I received several days ago two large packets, but have as yet read only your letter;<ref target="#foot.f2"/> for we have been in fearful distress &amp; I could attend to nothing. Our poor Boy had the rare case of second rash &amp; sore throat, besides mischief in kidneys; &amp; as if this was not enough a most serious attack of erysipelas with typhoid symptoms.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I despaired of his life; but this evening he has eaten one mouthful &amp; I think has passed the crisis. He has lived on Port-wine every <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>3</mn><mn>4</mn></mfrac></math></formula> of an hour day &amp; night. This evening to our astonishment he asked whether his stamps were safe &amp; I told him of the one sent by you,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> &amp; that he sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. see it tomorrow. He answered “I should awfully like to see it now”; so with difficulty he opened his eyelids &amp; glanced at it &amp; with a sigh of satisfaction said “all right”.— Children are one’s gretest happiness, but often &amp; often a still greter misery. A man of science ought to have none,—perhaps not a wife; for then there would be nothing in this wide world worth caring for &amp; a man might (whether he would is another question) work away like a Trojan.— I hope in a few days to get my Brains in order &amp; then I will pick out all your orchid letters (&amp; read by &amp; bye your last)<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; return them in hopes of your making use of them—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Planthanthera would be eminently well worth giving &amp; as much as feel safe about Cypripedium;<ref target="#foot.f7"/> in part I am not sure that I understand the passages by which insects crawl in &amp; out. Could you give a diagram?<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have such an arrear of letters &amp; such a number of experiments,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> all going to the dogs, that I have not time to make abstract of your letters. Will you return me such, as you do not use: but I hope you will be led to use all some time or another.—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> I shall be very glad to hear of <hi rend="underline">Rosmacks</hi> <hi rend="superscript">*</hi>? observations on Houstonia; you only just alluded to them.—<ref target="#foot.f11"/> You did formerly tell me about Specularia:<ref target="#foot.f12"/> in viola &amp; oxalis the case seems to me to be much too remarkable to be called “precocious flowering”.<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
<p><hi rend="superscript">*</hi>I hope he will publish note; I hear the French say that my paper on Primula is all pure imagination; but I cannot hear that this is grounded on any observations—<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>You will never read my horrid writing, if I write on both pages, of thin paper which I have taken in obedience to orders.—<ref target="#foot.f15"/> Of all the carpenters for knocking the right nail on the head, you are the very best: no one else has perceived that my chief interest in my orchid book, has been that it was a “flank movement” on the enemy.<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I live in such solitude that I hear nothing, &amp; have no idea to what you allude about Bentham &amp; the orchids &amp; Species.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> But I must enquire.—</p>
<p>By the way one of my chief enemies (the sole one who has annoyed me) namely Owen, I hear has been lecturing on Birds, &amp; admits that all have descended from <hi rend="underline">one</hi>, &amp; advances as his own idea that the oceanic wingless Birds have lost their wings by gradual disuse.<ref target="#foot.f18"/> He never alludes to me or only with bitter sneers &amp; coupled with Buffon, &amp; the Vestiges.—<ref target="#foot.f19"/></p>
<p>Well it has been an amusement to me this first evening scribbling as egotistically as usual about myself &amp; my doings; so you must forgive me, as I know well your kind heart will do.— I have managed to skim the news-paper, but had not heart to read all the bloody details. Good God what will the end be; perhaps we are too despondent here; but I must think you are too hopeful on your side of the water. I never believed the “canard” of the army of the Potomac having capitulated.<ref target="#foot.f20"/> My good dear wife &amp; self are come to wish for Peace at any price.</p>
<p>Good Night my good friend. I will scribble no no more— C. D.</p>
<p>One more word. I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like to hear what you think about what I say in last Ch. of Orchid Book on the meaning &amp; cause of the endless diversity of means for same general purpose.— It bears on design—that endless question—<ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
<p>Good Night Good Night.</p>
<p>P.S. Last night after writing the above, I read the great bundle of notes.<ref target="#foot.f22"/> Little did I think what I had to read. What admirable observations! You have distanced me on my own hobby-horse! I have not had for weeks such a glow of pleasure as your observations gave me.— Plat. hyperborea is indeed a most curious case &amp; especially interesting to me. How like the Bee ophrys.<ref target="#foot.f23"/> Does it live in arctic regions where insects may be scarce? It would be <hi rend="underline">very good</hi> to ascertain whether there actually is any occasional crossing, or removal of pollinia in this species.<ref target="#foot.f24"/> How curious about the nectary. See my <hi rend="underline">note</hi> p. 324 about Aceras.<ref target="#foot.f25"/> Aceras, I now find, leads, also, most closely into the rare O. hircina.<ref target="#foot.f26"/> How organic beings are connected! How excellently you have worked Cyp. spectabilis. I daresay I may be altogether wrong, &amp; fertilisation may always be by small insects bodily crawling in: I wish you could get some 2 youths to watch on warm day for 2 or 3 hours a fine plant of some Cypripedium.—<ref target="#foot.f27"/> What diversity in Platanthera— Your observations seem to me <hi rend="underline">much</hi> too good to be sunk in any review of my Book; they won’t be noticed.—<ref target="#foot.f28"/> But I am so very sorry I did not return your M.S. earlier: I shall be so grieved if I thus cause you inconvenience; but in truth it was physically impossible for me before last night to read or attend to anything.</p>

In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2498.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">‘Fertilization of orchids’</ref>, pp. 155–6 (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1506.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Collected papers</hi></ref> 2: 152), CD stated: <quote type="quote"> Prof. <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1957.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Asa Gray</ref>, after examining several American species of <hi rend="italic">Cypripedium</hi>, wrote to me … that he was convinced that I was in error, and that the flowers are fertilized by small insects entering the labellum through the large opening on the upper surface, and crawling out by one of the two small orifices close to either anther and the stigma. </quote> Gray detailed his observations in A. Gray 1862b, but did not provide any illustrations, concluding: ‘The beauty of these adaptations can be appreciated only by actual inspection of the parts or of a series of figures.’</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f23">Gray’s notes on this subject have not been found; however, in the portion of A. Gray 1862c that was published in the September number of the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Science and Arts</hi>, Gray disputed <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2357.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Joseph Dalton Hooker’s</ref> claim that <hi rend="italic">Platanthera hyperborea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P. dilatata</hi> constituted a single species, reporting that he had recently observed that ‘while <hi rend="italic">P. dilatata</hi> … can rarely if ever self-fertilise, <hi rend="italic">P. hyperborea</hi> readily does so, much in the manner of <hi rend="italic">Ophrys apifera</hi> as recently illustrated by Darwin’ (p. 259).

One of CD’s objectives in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6010.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Orchids</hi></ref> was to demonstrate that cross-fertilisation was the ‘main object’ of the contrivances by which orchids were pollinated (p. 1), and in the conclusion, he noted that the bee ophrys was anomalous in being adapted for self-fertilisation (p. 359). He had subsequently been speculating about possible explanations for this apparent anomaly (see letters from G. C. Oxenden, [before 30 May 1862], <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3618.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">21 June 1862</ref>, and 8 July 1862, and <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3591.xml" resp="#mjhawkins" cert="high">letter to A. G. More, 7 June [1862]</ref>).</note>

He went on to note that the ‘rigid, sharp-pointed papillæ, all directed forwards’, that were particularly striking on the stigma of <hi rend="italic">C. spectabile</hi>, offered ‘no slight confirmation’ of his own hypothesis, since they would act like a ‘wool-card’ in removing pollen from any insect ‘working its way upwards to the base of the labellum’.
