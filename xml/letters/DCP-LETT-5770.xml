<p>I am very much obliged to you for your kindness in having sent me your photograph which I am happy to possess.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I would have thanked you much sooner and answered your benevolent letter if I had not had in view to send you in the same time a little memoir on some observations (mentioned to you in my letters) But just now I hear this memoir will be published only in the next months.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>Also I am obliged to you for reminding me of Delpino’s work on fertilization.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> As now I am a regular reader of the Bot. Zeitung, I have read Hildebrand’s review of it.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Although of this matter, as far as our Westfalian plants are concerned, only few remains to extricate, I will continue to pursue it, in order to understand by which causes the various and frequently very complicated contrivances of flowers have been effected. For this purpose I will never be disgusted even of repeating chiefly the observations made by others.</p>
<p>〈  〉ly I have undertaken a new subject 〈of in〉vestigation which I intend to 〈p〉ursue during several years. I have begun to transplant turfs of mosses on other places in order to state which differences in structure are effected by altered conditions of life. As sometimes I have found the last shoots of moss turfs representing a variety widely different from the older shoots of the same turfs I believe mosses more than higher organized plants apt to show the effects of altered conditions of life.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>If you wish some observations to be made by me during the next summer, I will be happy to can accomplish any of your wishes.</p>
<p>With the greatest respect I remain | dear Sir, yours very faithfully | H. Müller.</p>
