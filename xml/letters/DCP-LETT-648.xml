<p>I am very much obliged for your letter &amp; most kind congratulations<ref target="#foot.f1"/> from yourself &amp; M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Horner &amp; Katharine.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> We are going on very well &amp; Emma is making a quicker recovery, owing I think to country air, than she has ever done before. Our children are very well &amp; Willy approves of “country ouse” very | much.— I think the place will suit us very well &amp; we have found moving so expensive, that I have not ceased to be thankful that we bought a very cheap house.— It is the quietest country, I ever lived in, &amp; I fear must be very dull to all visitors, as it is scarcely possible to take any drives. To the east &amp; west there are impassible valleys, to the south only one very narrow lane, &amp; to the north, through the village, only two other lanes.— For walking the country is very good there being foot-paths in every direction.— My brother, who detests the country, declared we ought to call the place “Down-in-the-Mouth”—but he is now with us &amp; has rather altered his opinion.—</p>
<p>I am exceedingly sorry to hear that M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Horner has not made more rapid progress;—with his activity of mind corporeal bondage must be, I am sure, extremely distressing. Pray tell him, that I have received such a letter from Lyell on my Coral Volume (I mention it, as he approved of it) that I have scarcely yet ceased stalking about like a peacock. I do hope by your return M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Horner will be sensibly better. His assistance &amp; that of all true friends, will be wanted at the Geolog. Soc. in November.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I never saw anything like poor Lonsdale’s deep gratification at the present—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> My paper is full. Emma joins in warmest thanks to you &amp; believe me, Yours truly obliged | C. Darwin</p>
