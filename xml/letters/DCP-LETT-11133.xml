<p>You may remember that I wrote you sometime ago, in regard to the prenatal influence of the mother upon her offspring.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Another case has just come under my notice, which I will relate.</p>
<p>Last week my wife and her mother visited the family of Rev. J. M. Williams—of West Liberty—Muscatine Co. Iowa.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> One of his children now two years old, was observed to vomit his food very soon after eating, and my wife remarked that his symptoms were exactly like those of a child whom she had formerly known in Atalissa, Iowa, who had swallowed a portion of concentrated lye, and who died of starvation, because it could not retain food.</p>
<p>The mother then informed them that while living in Beatrice, Nebraska, a child who had swallowed concentrated lye, and who was thus starving, used to come to their house, previous to the birth of her child—that she had always felt sorry for it, but <hi rend="underline">tried</hi> to <hi rend="underline">keep from worrying</hi> <hi rend="underline">about it</hi>, as she feared its effect upon her unborn child.</p>
<p>The parents are both healthy, as are two children born before the one of whom I write. One born since seems all right, except that the cords on one side of the neck are slightly contracted, drawing the head out of its proper position—</p>
<p>I should add that the mother thinks that the malady of her child was caused by the sympathy which she felt for the starving child, although, of course, it may be due to other causes—</p>
<p>Very truly yours— | Francis E. Nipher—</p>
