<p>Thanks JSH for his address [<hi rend="italic">Address delivered in the Ipswich Museum on 9th March 1848</hi>]. Questions a sentence which implies that only the practical use of a scientific discovery makes it worth while. The instinct for truth justifies science without any practical results.

<p>Thank you for your note &amp; giving me a chance of seeing you in town; but it was out of my power to take advantage of it, for I had previously arranged to go up to London on Monday. I should have much enjoyed seeing you. Thanks, also, for your Address,<ref target="#foot.f1"/> which I like very much. The anecdote about Whewell &amp; the tides,<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I had utterly forgotten; I believe it is near enough to the truth.— I rather demur to one sentence of yours, viz “however delightful any scientific pursuit may be, yet if it shall be wholly unapplied it is of no more use than building castles in the air”. Would not your hearers infer from this that the practical use of each scientific discovery ought to be immediate &amp; obvious to make it worthy of admiration? What a beautiful instance Chloriform is of a discovery made from <hi rend="underline">purely</hi> scientific researches, afterwards coming almost by chance into practical use.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> For myself I would, however, take higher ground, for I believe there exists, &amp; I feel within me, an instinct for truth, or knowledge or discovery, of something same nature as the instinct of virtue, &amp; that our having such an instinct is reason enough for scientific researches without any practical results <hi rend="underline">ever</hi> ensuing from them.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> You will wonder what makes me run on so, but I have been working very hard for the last 18 months on the anatomy &amp;c of the Cirripedia (on which I shall publish a monograph) &amp; some of my friends laugh at me, &amp; I fear the study of the cirripedia will ever remain “wholly unapplied”<ref target="#foot.f5"/> &amp; yet I feel that such study is better than castle-building.</p>
<p>Talking of Cirripedia, I must tell you a curious case I have just these few last days made out: all the Cirripedia are bisexual,<ref target="#foot.f6"/> except one genus, &amp; in this the female has the ordinary appearance, whereas the male has no one part of its body like the female &amp; is microscopically minute; but here comes the odd fact, the male or sometimes two males, at the instant they cease being locomotive larvæ become parasitic within the sack of the female, &amp; thus fixed &amp; half embedded in the flesh of their wives they pass their whole lives &amp; can never move again. Is it not strange that nature should have made this one genus unisexual, &amp; yet have fixed the males on the outside of the females;—the male organs in fact being thus external instead of internal.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I am delighted to hear good accounts of Hooker: if he should write to <hi rend="underline">you</hi> any letter which might be forwarded,<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I should be very glad to see it: I seldom hear any news of him, as I am so little in town, &amp; never see Sir W. Hooker. I do hope his great undertaking will well answer to him.—</p>
<p>Pray remember me very kindly to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. &amp; Miss Henslow. How pleasant the meeting at Oxford was;<ref target="#foot.f9"/> it is a white week<ref target="#foot.f10"/> in my memory. We are all well here, &amp; a sixth little (d)<ref target="#foot.f11"/> expected this summer: as for myself, however, I have had more unwellness than usual.<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>Believe me, my dear Henslow. | Ever most truly yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>If you are ever starting any young naturalist with his tools, recommend him to go to Smith &amp; Beck of 6 Colman St. City for a simple microscope: he has lately made one for me, partly from my own model &amp; with hints from Hooker, <hi rend="underline">wonderfully</hi> superior for coarse and fine dissections than any I ever before worked with. If I had had it sooner, it would have saved me many an hour.—</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">‘And to what profession ought a correct theory of the Tides to be of more importance than to the Navy?— and yet a scientific friend of mine was nearly laughed out of countenance by some brother officers, for having asked them … to assist in making certain observations that had been called for by the Master of Trinity College, Cambridge (Rev. Dr. Whewell), who has greatly occupied himself for several years in perfecting this branch of astronomical science. But when, afterwards, a printed copy of instructions and an account of the object in view was sent out to my friend, his sceptical comrades immediately and readily acknowledged that the Master of Trinity knew more about the theory of the Tides than all the officers of the Navy together; and they heartily set themselves to work in making those observations which were called for.’ (Henslow 1848a, p. 6).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">CD used the term ‘bisexual’ to mean hermaphrodite, although he occasionally also used the term to denote species with both male and female individuals, as in the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-1174.xml" resp="#automat" cert="medium">letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker, 10 May 1848</ref>. In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4838.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Living Cirripedia</hi> (1854): </ref>23, CD explained that: ‘Cirripedes are commonly bisexual or hermaphrodite, but in Ibla, Scalpellum, and Alcippe, members of the Lepadidæ in the order Thoracica, and in Cryptophialus in the order Abdominalia, the sexes are separate.’ See also <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi></ref>, pp. 33–4.</note>
