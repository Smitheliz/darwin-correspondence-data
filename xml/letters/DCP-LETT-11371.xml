            <p>Thinks WB’s proposal a very good one. CD could suggest two or three subjects for essays with respect to the vegetable kingdom, but they would require a long course of experiments "&amp; unfortunately there is hardly any one in this country who seems inclined to devote himself to experiments".</p>

<p>I received your letter this morning, &amp; it was quite impossible that you should receive an answer by 4 pm today.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> But this does not signify in the least for your proposal seems to me a very good one, &amp; I most entirely agree with you that it is far better to suggest some special question, rather than to have a general discussion compiled from books. The rule that the Essay must be “illustrative of the wisdom &amp; beneficence of the Almighty” would confine the subjects to be proposed.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> With respect to the Vegetable Kingdom I could suggest two or three subjects about which, as it seems to me, information is much required; but these subjects would require a long course of experiment &amp; unfortunately there is hardly any one in this country who seems inclined to devote himself to experiments.</p>
<p>Believe me, | Yours very sincerely | Charles Darwin.</p>
