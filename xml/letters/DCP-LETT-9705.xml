<p>I may have been led away by my imagination in fancying that one side of the face in the photograph of the holy Mary of Egypt expresses repentance and sorrow 〈&amp;〉 the other devout joy. I shall feel honoured by your retaining the photograph and pleased if you can get any other person to see in it the same expressions that I fancy it<ref target="#foot.f2"/> 〈<hi rend="underline">2 or 3 words</hi>〉 beginning to read the last sentence of your letter I felt a glow of pride come over 〈me〉 but I had barely finished its perusal when I remembered the story of Apelles &amp; the cobbler and at once perceived its remarkable applicability.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> No d〈o〉ubt the cobbler would have been glad to paint pictures like Apelles and I should have been delighted to write your book on Expression—if I could. However I have ere now taken to heart the painters advice 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 crepida〈m〉<ref target="#foot.f4"/> 〈<hi rend="underline">several words </hi>〉 be allowed to 〈<hi rend="underline">several words</hi>〉 which you may per〈  〉 〈<hi rend="underline">1 or 2 words</hi>〉 of use. I do not know whet〈her〉 you have noticed D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ferriers 〈obser〉vation that when he irritated a certain 〈co〉nvolution of the brain gently the paw of the animal moved but when the irritation was a little stronger it spread to the neighbouring 〈co〉nvolution which regulated the movements of the mouth.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> The retraction of the angle of the mouth 〈<hi rend="underline">about 4 words</hi>〉 movements of 〈<hi rend="underline">4 or 5 words</hi>〉 thinks 〈<hi rend="underline">3 or 4 words</hi>〉 of the right angle 〈<hi rend="underline">2 or 3 words</hi>〉 often seen in carpenters 〈<hi rend="underline">1 or 2 words</hi>〉 a C〈  〉 in with 〈  〉 right hand is due to the violent excite〈m〉en〈t〉 in the one convolution spreading to the other. I cannot at present lay hands on my copy of the West Riding Asylum reports to see whether the convolutions for listening ie. pricking up the ears &amp; opening the mouth are adjacent or not but it seems possible that these also may be connected in the same way as the movements of the hands 〈<hi rend="underline">3 or 4 words</hi>〉 mouth.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> Ferriers expressi〈ons〉 certainly show that irr〈itation〉 of some parts of the brain may cause movements of muscles on the other side of the face only although irrit〈a〉tion of other parts will cause movements extending to both sides. Now as D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Crichton Browne<ref target="#foot.f7"/> tells me that the convolutions on the two sides are symmetrical in idiots but become more 〈and〉 more un〈symmetri〉cal until 〈  〉 becomes developed it 〈  〉 probable that in the same proportion we may look for differences between the two sides of the face whenever the facial muscles are set in action by stimuli from the brain. In maniacs the two sides of the brain are very unsymmetrical and in them I think twitchings &amp; contractions of one side of the face are often observed which I think they 〈<hi rend="underline">3 or 4 words</hi>〉 I will ask D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Browne about 〈  〉 however so as to be cer〈tain〉    M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Ernest Hart tells me that Americans have a general notion that girls with a cast in their eyes have more expressive faces than others and that some girls of high culture &amp; mental power get a slight ca〈s〉t in their eyes when excited.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> He instanced one, a daughter of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Marion Sims<ref target="#foot.f9"/> who had this &amp; she, he says, certainly had an 〈<hi rend="underline">1 or 2 words</hi>〉 expressive face 〈<hi rend="underline">several words over 2 lines</hi>〉</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Brunton had sent CD a postcard showing a photograph of a drawing of Mary of Egypt copied from the painting by Jusepe de Ribera (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9701.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from T. L. Brunton, [29] October [1874]</ref> and n. 2); this postcard is in DAR 53.1: 40. See plate on p. 525. Brunton had first described the different expressions on the two sides of the face of the saint (now considered to be St Agnes) in December 1873 (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1581.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi></ref> vol. 21, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-9167.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from T. L. Brunton, 2 December 1873</ref> and n. 2). CD evidently tested Brunton’s reading of the expressions by asking <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_5019.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Hensleigh Wedgwood</ref> and <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_1222.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Francis Darwin</ref> for their opinions. He recorded their views on the back of the photograph: ‘Hensleigh W. thinks one side more seraphic than the other.’; ‘F.D. thinks one side hopeful the other sadder.’</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">When the famous Greek painter Apelles heard a cobbler criticise his depiction of a sandal in a painting, he acknowledged the cobbler’s expertise, and made corrections to the picture. The following day, the cobbler, filled with pride at seeing the altered painting, proceeded to criticise the leg, at which Apelles admonished him to judge only those things about which he was knowledgeable. See Pliny the Elder, <hi rend="italic">Natural history</hi>, 35.10.36.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">Brunton probably wrote, ‘Ne sutor ultra crepidam’ (Shoemaker, not above the sandal), the riposte made by Apelles when he rebuked the cobbler for judging beyond his expertise.</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f6">Ferrier’s paper (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2493.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ferrier 1873</ref>), published in the <hi rend="italic">West Riding Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports</hi>, was an account of his experiments on the localisation of centres of muscular movement in rabbits, dogs, and cats. The application of electrodes to the brain of a cat showed that the convolutions that produced repeated closing and opening of the jaws were close to those that produced movement in the ears (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2493.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ferrier 1873</ref>, pp. 42–4).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">Crichton-Browne was medical director of the West Riding Asylum.
