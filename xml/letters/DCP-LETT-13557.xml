<p>I have gone thoroughly into the matter of the Steudel with Bentham Dyer &amp; Oliver, &amp; all agreeing that Mr Daydon Jackson was the only man well qualified by experience &amp;c, I wrote to him, &amp; had him here, when I asked him to put a plan upon paper, for doing the work on £200 per annum; &amp; submit to me—<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>He sends me the enclosed, &amp; says that the work will take 5 years or possibly 6. in so far as he can see.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>From the enclosed you will see that the first year will cost £262.0.6., the remainder £208.8.0.</p>
<p>Of course if you give £250 per annum it would be got out proportionally sooner,—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> It is however impossible to get a nearer estimate until the work is begun.</p>
<p>Mr Jackson asks £115 per annum personal labor, for which he would devote 3 days (full) a week to the work himself.—</p>
<p>We should of course all help. Please return Jackson’s letter with your views. I should not be disposed to say any-thing about the other £50 per annum till we see how the work proceeds.—</p>
<p>Mr Jackson could begin next February— we regard him as competent &amp; entirely trustworthy.</p>
<p>I have been reading Lyells life with great interest. It is a great pity that it was not cut down to one volume, but as it is I am only too glad to get it in any shape. I really think that M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Lyell has given us a very important contribution to the history of Science.—&amp; it does make one “warm to” Lyell himself.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> The accounts of the early history of the Geological, it’s dinners &amp;c, are most entertaining &amp; instructive; so too is the substance of many of his journeys, in which he chronicles the labor of many good men whose names deserve to be remembered. The account of Cuvier, &amp; his way of working, is most curious. The letters to Herschel, are the best, they are evidently very careful compositions.<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>Do you observe certain passages that seem to <hi rend="underline">prove</hi> that he never could expected to come into the Kinnordy property on his father’s death? &amp; that on the contrary he looked from an early age to providing himself with a modest competency for his latter days.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I cannot but think there is some utter misconception as to his father having deceived him as to Kinnordy. The latter was always regarded as a most upright honorable man; he was not wealthy, &amp; he left 2 sons (one in bad health) with nothing but their pensions &amp; 4? daughters (2 I think in bad health) with nothing at all, but the clothes on their backs.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>We go to Pendock on Friday for Christmas week.<ref target="#foot.f8"/></p>

Contrary to Hooker’s supposition, Lyell was unaware that his father had instead established a trust fund to provide equal shares of the income from the estate for each of his eight children. Even with the addition of the rent from the home farm at Kinnordy, Lyell was left with a smaller income than he would have had if he had inherited the estate and each of his siblings had received an annuity. Prior to this, Lyell had an adequate income from his publications and the £500 annual allowance from his marriage settlement. See <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_11387.xml">L. G.
