<p>As Emma will see you so soon I must take the occasion to thank you for your letter. it gave me very great pleasure I had one from Emma the same day &amp; I sat cogitating over them both with great satisfaction &amp; many pleasant thoughts. I have had such a pleasant two days here. I could not well get to Maer tho I wanted so much to see Emma so that it was delightful to be able to meet her here &amp; I shall wait now with great patience till I can pay a comfortable visit at Maer, &amp; if I can fall across a visit of your’s there I shall be very glad. I have had an infinite quantity of talking to get into two days— I have had so many people to do besides Emma, for Marianne arrived today &amp; tho I have worked hard all day I have not got in my share of her yet. Susan &amp; I have had a most comfortable chat we cannot reproach ourselves with not taking it out— it is so delightful to find them all as happy as I feel myself. I dont think any body ever had so delightful a reception into a family as Emma. I think this is a capital plan of her going up &amp; helping you to choose a house &amp; I dare say it will help you over your difficulties very much.</p>
<p>Goodbye dear Charles | believe me your very affect<hi rend="superscript">te</hi>| cousin &amp; sister C L</p>
