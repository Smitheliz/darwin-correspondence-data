<p>My father writes as follows in his Preface to the Life of Erasmus Darwin.</p>
                    <p>“In the February number 1879, of a well known German scientific Journal “Kosmos”, D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ernst Krause published A sketch of the life of Erasmus Darwin … and D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krause has kindly allowed my brother and myself to have a translation made of it for publication in this country.”<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>And as a footnote</p>
                    <p>“Since the publication of D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Krause’s article, M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Butler’s work Evolution Old and New 1879 has appeared …”<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
                    <p>Supposing these statements to be strictly accurate, could, or could not, a passage have been introduced into the article from Butler’s Book. I say it could not. But as a fact a passage (a quotation from Buffon) was introduced into the translated article from Butler without any acknowledgement, and Butler’s book was attacked in the article, though not by name.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Therefore the Preface is inaccurate. Leaving Butler as much as possible out of consideration, what is the most honourable course to be followed by anyone whose name is attached to an inaccurate statement which is being published, and to which the interested party, on whatever grounds, strongly objects? Is it not to insure, if possible, that no more copies are sold with this inaccurate statement? This could be very easily be done by inserting a slip somewhat as follows.</p> 
<p rend="centre"><hi rend="underline">Errata</hi></p> 
<p>Preface, page III line 8   after the words “has kindly” insert the words “made considerable alterations and additions in it, and”</p>
<p>Page— With reference to the passage quoted from Buffon insert the following—Foot Note:—Taken from Butler’s Evolution Old and New</p>
<p>Butler will no doubt consider it a triumph, and will probably write to the papers a letter headed “M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Darwin’s Apology”, and will continue to make all sorts of unpleasant insinuations. But this he will probably do in any case (especially if D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Krause enters into the controversy), and it seems to me best that he should be thought of as little as possible, and the only question that should be considered is What is the most just thing to do?</p>
<p>Were I my father under the circumstances, I should feel quite comfortable if I knew that everything that appeared with my name attached to it was quite in accordance with the facts; but until I felt that I should not rest quite satisfied.</p>
                    <p>My father promised Butler to make a correction of this sort if another edition appeared, but it is now probable that no second edition will be published—at all events not for some years.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> Looking to the future, is it not better that this correction should be made during his lifetime, however trivial it may be.</p>
<p>It has been objected that this is an somewhat underhand way of putting things right, and that a letter should be written to some paper to say that it has been done. Otherwise Butler might not hear of it for years. But for myself I do not think it worth doing this.</p>
