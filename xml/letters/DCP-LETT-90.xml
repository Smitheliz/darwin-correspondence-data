<p>I write to thank you for the Paper, &amp; at the same time to congratulate you on your <hi rend="underline">very very good degree</hi>, tho I must say I should have been disapointed had you not been a leading man, knowing your predilection for Mathematicks.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have just this moment returned from a Fox chase, we found in a nice place for a Tally, &amp; ran very well til after the first check when Scent would not alow of more sport. I have witnessed a few very pretty things in the hunting way this year, but I begin to think of studying divinity which is more profitable to the soul than field sports. I am almost afraid to inquire whether Lumsley Hodgson<ref target="#foot.f2"/> has passed as I can not find his name. I hope you will not get so very drunk but that you can find time to tell me a little of your future prospects, I suppose you will shortly look out for a partner for your future Vicarage, as well as a pretty patern for <hi rend="underline">nightcaps</hi>. You have to keep another term I think, and as you will be to &amp; fro to London do let me have the pleasure of seeing you before you return for good to Shrewsbury, which is an awful distance from Feversham.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> The disturbances in our neighbouhood<ref target="#foot.f4"/> are quite gone, however my Brother has thought fit to enlist in the Yeoman troops, in order to put some of them to the rout in case of necessity. I hope you did not forget to give my general invitation to Fox. I always was particularly partial to him, and hope at some time to view him again. What sort of a Master does Graham make<ref target="#foot.f5"/></p>
<p>I have no news to tell you, but I shall expect to hear from you at <hi rend="underline">some</hi> time and with my best wishes for your future welfare, &amp; good choice of a Wife believe me to | Remain sincerely Your’s | Geo. Simpson</p>
