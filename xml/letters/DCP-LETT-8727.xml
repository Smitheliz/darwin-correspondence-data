<p>Fascinated by Greg’s <hi rend="italic">Enigmas</hi>, though its matter is weak.</p> 
            <p>Is vexed at being drawn into hostility toward British Museum through William Carruthers’ insolence and presumption.</p>
            <p>Recounts visit with Edward Cardwell [Secretary for War].</p>
            <p>Has sent Candolle’s book to Gladstone.</p>
            <p>JDH indignant at Gladstone’s speech putting English science below French and German.</p>
            <p>Thinks it is an accepted dogma that glandular hairs are excreting only. Will ask others to confirm.</p>

<p>A long letter from you is no new sensation—though I have experienced but little of its delights of late.<ref target="#foot.f1"/></p>
<p>Our Drosophyllum flowered itself to death last summer— it went on from May till September &amp; then could not stop its flowering, nor its consequent apotheosis. We have given so many young plants away that I can easily get you a couple.<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>Greg’s “Enigmas”<ref target="#foot.f3"/> is one of the most eloquent books I ever read, &amp; it quite fascinated me by it’s manner, not by its matter, which is singularly weak &amp; inconclusive. I wrote to him combating some of his positions, &amp; met him soon after, &amp; had a delightful conversation. As to the poor man’s faith, he frankly admitted to me that, as I put it, all scientific evidence is in favor of extinction upon death, &amp; that any reasoning to the contrary was “ingenious wriggling.”— I quite agreed with him however, that this was not conclusive, &amp; that there was no inexcusable presumption in the conclusion, that there was a future state. It is a book that cannot but be disappointing: remember all it pretends to do is, not to crush hope, but to foster the presumption of hope being tenable—barely tenable perhaps!</p>
<p>I like Greg exceedingly, &amp; should like to bring him to Down.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> (of course the Scientific part proper of the book is all but a mistake.) Ayrton I hear nothing of; our armed truce holds.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I quite believe that Gladstone has literally muzzled him as regards Kew—i.e. told him to <hi rend="underline">interfere</hi> in nothing—i.e. to originate no change whatever.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> The Belgian Academy were very civil—&amp; wrote to me saying they intended making the opportunity of a vacancy the occasion of marking their disapprobation of the treatment I have received.<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>
<p>I am extremely vexed at being dragged into hostility towards the British Museum, through Mr. Carruthers intolerable insolence—&amp; presumption—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> the carelessness of his statements really amounts to falsity.— I have born as gently on his misstatements as I could— He must be a very odd man— within 3 months he has grossly &amp; unprovokedly insulted, myself, Lockyer, Dyer, Bate, &amp; Bentham,<ref target="#foot.f9"/> all on different matters— I had no idea that he was such an ill conditioned Cur.— his letters to me are most insolent.</p>
<p>We have just returned from a visit to Cardwells, near Godalming—<ref target="#foot.f10"/> both he &amp; his wife are singularly pleasing persons at home— He is almost a religious man, or I should say a devout one perhaps. We had some long talks about faith &amp; prayer— he was very frank, admitting to the full how much more difficult it was for a Scientific man to believe, than for any other—that the Miracles were open questions, of Evidence entirely—&amp; that prayer in the common sense was wrong—he much regretted such occasional outbursts as Huxley’s,<ref target="#foot.f11"/>—but blamed the Clergy more.</p>
<p>He was singularly earnest candid &amp; calm, even on such matters as Darwinism! which he only a little believes—much disliking some of the results (monkeydom eg.) but could see even in this no opposition to any religion worth holding.</p>
<p>I have just skimmed DeCandolle &amp; thought it very interesting indeed, except the last chapters, of which I read but one or two, &amp; thought it twaddle.<ref target="#foot.f12"/> I have sent my copy to Gladstone, being indignant at his speech, in which he puts England’s position in respect of abstract Science far below that of France &amp; Germany. He is going to print that address, &amp; it will be laughed at in America &amp; Germany, &amp; come with a very bad grace indeed from the Prime Minister of England.<ref target="#foot.f13"/> I glanced at his “Juventus Mundi” yesterday &amp; was astonished at its puerility— Wedgwood is a science to some parts of it!<ref target="#foot.f14"/></p>
<p>Have you heard that they intend to run me against the D. of Devonshire as P.R.S.<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I do dread the weight of the position more than I can tell, &amp; would not listen to it for a moment, but that I owe a deep debt of gratitude to the scientific men who have proposed me, for their generous support last summer—<ref target="#foot.f16"/> I was told of it at the X last Thursday as a settled thing.<ref target="#foot.f17"/> About half the Council are supposed to be prepared to support me. Airy &amp; the Cantabs<ref target="#foot.f18"/> all going in for the Duke— an excellent choice in my opinion (God prosper him!). They are greatly angered at Sabine’s<ref target="#foot.f19"/> having written to the Duke, without acquainting the Council inviting him to stand.</p>
<p>Archibald Smith’s death is a great loss to me. We had been intimate from very early years, &amp; I had an equal affection &amp; esteem for him— he was a neighbour too.<ref target="#foot.f20"/></p>
<p>I have wandered away from Drosera &amp; the question you put.<ref target="#foot.f21"/> In so far as I can remember it is an accepted dogma that there is no cutaneous absorption in living plants &amp; that glandular hairs are excretory only. I will however ask Dyer, who is away with a cold— he is translating Sachs, &amp; will be up to the latest discoveries.<ref target="#foot.f22"/> I will also ask Berkeley.<ref target="#foot.f23"/> Your aggregation of the protoplasmic contents of the cell, reminds me of the contraction of the chlorophyll contents &amp; ? inner cell wall of the cells under Sun-light in a Selaginella (<hi rend="underline">serpens</hi> I think).<ref target="#foot.f24"/></p>
<p>Have you tried Begonia leaves, or shall I look out for some plants with hyaline<ref target="#foot.f25"/> bladdery epidermal cells for you to operate upon— Can you correlate the specific action of the Ammonia on the protoplasm of the cells, with that of its effect in the blood of animals poisoned by snake bites.— Is it not the case that snake poisons affects the blood corpuscles?<ref target="#foot.f26"/></p>
