<p>I send by this post Chapt IX, but I earnestly beg you not to strain your mind &amp; return the sheets marked “uncorrected” if, as I expect, you find it too much for you.—<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It will give me only a little additional trouble. The figures have not been compared. As I had Chapt VIII almost finished a week ago, I despatched it then to the Printers: it had no figures &amp; related to the constitutional vigour of the crossed Plants.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Some of the present sheets are so heavily corrected that they will be difficult for you to read.</p>
<p>I have put your tools &amp;c up-stairs in order so far as not to be injured; but I cannot find your compound microscope to protect from dust.— I have made a few notes on the state of your plants in the Hot-house.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>My dearest son, your little note yesterday to mother, in which you say that you love me was the greatest possible comfort to me.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I have been thinking much about you during your whole life, &amp; I am sure that you have deserved the love of your poor dear sweet darling. I am so deeply glad that she did not suffer at last,— it is my only poor consolation.</p>
<p>God bless you my dearest son. Give my best love to M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Ruck:<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I never in my life saw her equal for goodness &amp; kindness of heart. I was much affected by Dicky’s letter to George:<ref target="#foot.f6"/> he was a great comfort to us all.</p>
