<p>I am much obliged for your kind note &amp; the present of the volume.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I did not know that you were still in England—otherwise I should have written to you. I saw that you were at Glasgow, but we were then suffering terrible grief from the sudden death of a dear daughter-in-law &amp; some anxiety from a very dangerous accident to one of my sons. and we thought we should have to leave home,—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> But we are now more tranquil— If you could spare the time it would give me the <hi rend="underline">greatest</hi> pleasure to see you here though I am not capable of prolonged conversation  I would suggest your coming here, by the train which leaves Charing Cross at 11<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>—35′ for Orpington St<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. &amp; you could return by the train which leaves Orpington at 4<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>— 33′ If you would let me hear on what day you could come (if this is possible) I would send a carriage to meet you— If M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>.
