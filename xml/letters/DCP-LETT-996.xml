                <div type="transcription">
<p>I hope this letter will catch you at Clifton, but I have been prevented writing by being unwell &amp; having had the Horner’s here as visitor, which with my abominable press-work has fully occupied my time. It is, indeed, a long time since we wrote to each other; though, I beg to tell you, that I wrote last, but what about I cannot remember, except, I know, it was after reading your last numbers, &amp; I sent you a uniquely laudatory epistle, considering that it was from a man who hardly knows a daisy from a Dandelion to a professed Botanist.— By the way I announced Hopkirk’s book being sent back, did it reach you?—</p>
<p>I was very glad to hear what you were about; but I fear you must feel your time rather thrown away.— I cannot remember, what papers have given me the impression, but I have that, which you state to be the case, firmly fixed on my mind, namely the little chemical importance of the soil to its vegetation.— What a strong fact it is, as R Brown once remarked to me, of certain plants being calcareous ones here which are not so under a more favourable climate on the continent, or the reverse, for I forget which; but you no doubt will know to what I refer.— By the way there are some such cases in Herbert’s paper in Hort. Journal:<ref target="#foot.f1"/> have you read it, it struck me as extremely original &amp; bears <hi rend="underline">directly</hi> on your present researches.— To a <hi rend="underline">non-botanist</hi> the Chalk has the most peculiar aspect of any flora in England; why will you not come here &amp; make your observations? <hi rend="underline">We</hi> go to Southampton, if my courage &amp; stomach do not fail, for the Brit. Assoc: (do you not consider it your duty to be there?), &amp; why cannot you come here afterwards &amp; <hi rend="underline">work</hi>. I expect Sulivan here the first week in October &amp; I hope to get a few more here, &amp; how glad we should be if you c<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> come then or at any time whatever.—</p>
<p>Before the end of the month, I shall have quite finished my S. American Geology, &amp; extremely glad I shall be, for I have been pushing on &amp; feeling jaded for the last several months by it.—</p>
<p>I am astonished (having felt a curiosity on the point) at the number of species on 2 square yards (or two yards square?); though I cannot read whether it is <hi rend="underline">26</hi> or <hi rend="underline">16</hi> to 48 species; does this include cryptogams: if you do <hi rend="underline">not</hi> publish this, I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> like much sometime to hear more particulars about this; if you publish, where will it be?<ref target="#foot.f2"/></p>
<p>I am much pleased to hear you have worked out the identical &amp; representative species of N. temperate &amp; Antarctic regions &amp; shall be exceedingly glad to see it; but as it <hi rend="doubleUnderline">of course</hi> will be published, I will not think of troubling you to send it me: I hope you will add, whenever you know, whether species of the same genera are found in the intermediate <hi rend="underline">tropical</hi> districts, saying, whether in America or elsewhere, whether on high-lands or lowlands; this no doubt w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> add to your trouble, even if you gave <hi rend="underline">only</hi> such information as you possessed without search, &amp; surely it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> add great interest to your results: M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Gardener’s list of Mountain Brazil plants<ref target="#foot.f3"/> w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> thus come incidentally in, as indeed w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> lists from all parts of the world.</p>
<p>I have not yet seen Forbe’s memoir,<ref target="#foot.f4"/> but have ordered it, &amp; will enjoy writing to you my opinion. I am very sorry to hear what you say about Watson’s previous work; I feel sure that Forbe’s own noble indifference to fame is the main cause of his not in some instances making proper acknowledgment.— Horner (<hi rend="underline">private</hi>) tells me that he has just remonstrated with him, for not having mentioned Lyell’s views on climatic changes, &amp; his answer was,—“I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> as soon have thought it necessary to refer to Linnæus, as originator of specific characters”.—&amp; I have no doubt this is the simple truth.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I cannot remember whether I have ever read (except a few papers) any of Watson’s works: could you sometime lend me the chief? I sh<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. much like to see them.</p>
<p>I am almost sorry for your eternal additional labours on the Galapagos Flora; though as yet your work assuredly has not been thrown away, as many have referred to your curious geographical results on this archipelago.— I suppose you feel sure that Edmonston’s Collections from the mainland have not been mingled with those of the Galapagos—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>Have you ever thought of G. St. Hilaire “loi du balancement”, as applied to plants: I am well aware that some zoologists quite reject it, but it certainly appears to me, that it often holds good with animals.— You are no doubt aware of the kind facts I refer to, such as great development of canines in the carnivora apparently causing a diminution—a compensation or balancement—in the small size of premolars &amp;c &amp;c.—<ref target="#foot.f7"/> I have incidentally noticed some analogous remarks on plants, but have never seen it discussed by Botanists.— Can you think of cases of any one species in genus, or genus in family, with certain parts extra developed, &amp; some adjoining parts reduced? In varieties of same species, double flowers &amp; large fruits seem something of this,—want of pollen &amp; of seeds balancing with the increased number of petals &amp; development of fruit.—</p>
<p>—I hope we shall see you here this autumn, &amp; I will let you know when Sulivan comes—or anytime will suit us.</p>
<p>Ever my dear Hooker | Most truly yours | C. Darwin</p>
<p>Do you know whether Dieffenbach is in London, &amp; where?</p>
<p>P.S. | (I do not quite understand, do you intend giving up the Museum of Economic Geology altogether? I know it is private:— I sh〈<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be〉 almost glad of it.—)</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Although it is not clear to what Hooker’s figures apply, CD’s interest was probably aroused by the evidence they provided for the diversity of vegetation in small areas and under uniform conditions of life. Such evidence became important to CD in support of his principle that the maximum diversity of living beings permits the maximum amount of organic life in any area, and the corollary that natural selection, by tending to maximise the amount of organic life, will also tend to maximise the diversity of organic beings. These ideas formed the basis of CD’s principle of divergence as elaborated in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5799.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Natural selection</hi></ref> (pp. 227–51) and the <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>.</note>
