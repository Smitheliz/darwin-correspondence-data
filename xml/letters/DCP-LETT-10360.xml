<p>Pardon the liberty I take in sending you the following facts, I wish to draw your attention to them in the hope that they may be of service to you.</p>
<p>I at times amuse myself by giving to my youngest son (aged 18 months) some pieces of orange peel to play with.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I have noticed that he tries to retain seven or eight of them in his grasp at one time. He will try repeatedly to grasp them in his <hi rend="underline">left</hi> hand but will fail to do so until he has made the attempt many times, but having succeeded he will look up and give a smile of satisfaction. What I think may be remarkable is that, when he tries to grasp all the pieces at one time in his <hi rend="underline">right</hi> hand, he always cries when the attempt is not successful, and at times he will give the most shrill screams of vexation and annoyance. He never gives a sign of displeasure when trying with his left hand.</p>
<p>While staying at Chingford last summer and collecting just at dusk, I captured two insects in my net that were flying over some nettles, and was surprised to find they were two different species in copulation. The male was a specimen of Camptogramma bilineata and the female was a Botys verticalis.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I boxed them carefully and upon arriving at home I found them still in coition. I wished to obtain eggs and breed from them, so left directions with my wife<ref target="#foot.f3"/> to keep them safely till I returned, as I had to come to Town that night. When I saw them two days afterwards they were dead, and no eggs had been laid. They had died on the previous day. I have not seen or heard of a case in which different species of moths have been found copulating in a state of nature.</p>
<p>If the specimens would be of any service to you I shall be pleased to forward them</p>
<p>I remain Sir | yours sincerely | H. B. Smyth. <lb resp="#mjhawkins"/></p>
