<p>I have just finished your lecture— It is an admirable scientific argument &amp; most powerful.— I wish that it could be sown broadcast througout the land. Your courage is marvellous &amp; I wonder that you were not stoned on the spot.— And in Scotland!<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Do please tell me how it was received in the Lecture Hall?!!</p>
<p>About man being made like a monkey p. 37 is quite new to me; &amp; the argument in an earlier place p. 8/ on the law of parsimony <hi rend="underline">admirably</hi> put. Yes p. 21 is new to me.—<ref target="#foot.f3"/> All strikes me as very clear &amp; considering small space you have chosen your lines of reasoning excellently.</p>
<p>But I am tired | so good night | C. Darwin</p>
<p>The few last pages are awfully powerful in my opinion.—</p>
<p>Sunday Morning— The above was written last night in the enthusiasm of the moment &amp; now this dark dismal Sunday morning I fully agree with what I said.—</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear about the failures in the graft-experiments &amp; not from your own fault or ill luck.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> Trollope in one of his novels gives as a maxim of constant use by a brick maker “it is dogged as does it”; &amp; I have often &amp; often thought this is the motto for every scientific worker.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> I am sure it is yours if you do not give up Pangenesis with wicked imprecations. By the way G Jaeger has just brought out in Kosmos a chemical sort of Pangenesis, bearing chiefly on inheritance.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I cannot conceive why I have not offered my garden for your experiments. I w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">attend</hi> to the plants, as far as <hi rend="underline">mere</hi> care goes with pleasure. But Down is an awkward place to reach<ref target="#foot.f7"/></p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The date is established by the relationship between this letter and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-11283.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from G. J. Romanes, 2 December 1877</ref>. In 1877, 2 December was a Sunday. </note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Romanes sent CD a copy of his lecture to the Philosophical Society of Ross-shire, ‘The scientific evidence of organic evolution: a discourse’ (G. J. Romanes 1877c). CD’s annotated copy is in the Darwin Pamphlet Collection–CUL. For more on the reaction of Scottish Presbyterians to Darwinian theory, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10480.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">D. N. Livingstone 2014</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Romanes had argued that if humans were specially created they were evidently modelled on apes (G. J. Romanes 1877c, p. 37; CD scored the passage in his copy). In <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 8, he noted that parsimony forbade the assumption of higher causes when lower ones were sufficient to explain something. In <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 21, he pointed out the difficulty of explaining deviations from typical structure under the theory of ideal types, and that the Darwinian view of adaptive modification was able to account for such deviations.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The letter from Romanes discussing his grafting experiments has not been found; the experiments were undertaken to test CD’s hypothesis of pangenesis (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-10986.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from G. J. Romanes, 6 June 1877</ref> and n. 6).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">‘It’s dogged as does it’ is the title of a chapter in <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4809.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Anthony Trollope’s</ref> novel, <hi rend="italic">The last chronicle of Barset</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10460.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Trollope 1867</ref>, 2: 181–92); it is the advice given to Mr Crawley by Giles Hoggett, the brickmaker.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f6"><ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_2514.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Gustav Jäger</ref> had published ‘physiological letters’ on inheritance in <hi rend="italic">Kosmos</hi> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_10352.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Jäger 1877</ref>); CD probably refers to the second of these, which appeared in the July issue, and in which Jäger discussed sexual chemical signals. For more on Jäger’s chemical transmutation theory as a modified pangenesis theory, see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_8263.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Weinreich 1993</ref>, pp. 128–37.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The closest railway station to CD’s home, Down House, was Orpington, on a branch line of the <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4474.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">South Eastern Railway</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f8">A slightly shorter version of Romanes’s lecture was published in the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi>, December 1881 (G. J. Romanes 1881).</note>
