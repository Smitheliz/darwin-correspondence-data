<p>I am very much concerned to hear of your increased illness; but I expected it having been told by various persons throughout the summer that you were not so well this year.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> Let us hope that Malvern wells will give you a little relief so as to enable you to work cheerfully &amp; correspond with your friends again. If it would not be annoying I should like to send you a letter with Natural History chit chat now &amp; then, regardless of your answering me punctually.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the loan of Asa Gray’s reviews.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Really my little paper in the Linnean has been greatly honoured to be reviewed by Darwin &amp; Asa Gray.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> How capitally Gray has done it. I did not think it possible that the complex details of variation &amp;c which I gave could be so briefly &amp; luminously brought to a focus. I think I must write to him to thank him.</p>
<p>The review in the Times of my book has caused quite a commotion.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I consider it the best that has yet been written. It is also of great general importance because it is a public concession on the part of the highest literary tribunal, of the claims of philosophical natural history to the attention of the public. My old Father happens to be on a visit to me &amp; the review came very apropos, causing great elation in our little family circle.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> My Father is an old man of business who thinks everything right that is said by the Times; &amp; who begins now to see that his son really has written a goodish book.</p>
<p>The longest review that has yet appeared is in the Revue des deux mondes by Forgues.<ref target="#foot.f6"/> It is also most excellently done &amp; I think shows a closer examination &amp; higher appreciation of the book than any that has yet appeared in England except that of the Times.</p>
<p>You ask me what I am doing. I have been commissioned by Mr W. Wilson Saunders to write a monograph of the Mantidæ (a remarkable family of Insects).<ref target="#foot.f7"/> The work is to appear in the Ray Society series, in 4<hi rend="superscript">to</hi> illustrated by 20 plates by Westwood.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> This has occupied me the last 4 months &amp; will continue to occupy me for 18 months longer. M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Saunders pays me (moderately) for the work &amp; leaves me all the credit. This work leaves me time for other things, such as short articles &amp; I had commenced one on the whole subject of local variation, intending to incorporate details of facts of new varieties interbreeding with counterparts, which you require.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> But the monograph is so much pleasanter work just now that I have laid this paper aside for the present.</p>
<p>I will not write more just now | Yours sincerely | H W Bates</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">CD’s letter to Bates has not been found; however, see n. 2, below.

            <note xml:id="foot.f6"><ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref> was reviewed by the French man of letters, Paul-Emile Daurand Forgues, in the 1 August 1863 issue of the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> (Forgues 1863).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f7">The reference is to <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_4188.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">William Wilson Saunders</ref>, a wealthy insurance broker with an interest in entomology (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2063.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>).

The <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3945.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Ray Society</ref> was established in 1844 to publish important works of natural history that were unlikely to prove commercially profitable (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_1694.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Curle 1954</ref>, p. 2).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f9">Bates had intended to include a long discussion of the ‘origin of species by segregation of races’ in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_447.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1863</ref>, but there had been insufficient space (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4079.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from H. W. Bates, 8 April 1863</ref>). He consequently engaged to write an article entitled ‘Geographical relations of species, and their varieties’ for the <hi rend="italic">Natural History Review</hi> (see <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4138.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from H. W. Bates, 2 May [1863]</ref> and n. 7, and <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_456.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Bates 1892</ref>, pp. lxvii–lxx); however, the paper was never completed (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6763.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Royal Society catalogue of scientific papers</hi></ref>).
