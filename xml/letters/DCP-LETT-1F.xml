            <p>Erasmus Alvey Darwin has rheumatism; his sisters complain of his bad temper but CD thinks him very good tempered. CD has received a new cabinet. [This is the first of six entries written in a "Memorandum book" comprising four sheets folded into a gather and sewn together in book form. The entries are in the style of letters addressed to an unnamed friend and are dated between 1 and 12 January 1822, shortly before CD’s thirteenth birthday. As they were written straight into the memorandum book, it is clear that they were never sent through the post, but were either to an imaginary recipient, or intended to be read by someone in the household, possibly CD’s youngest sister, Emily Catherine Darwin (Catherine).]</p>

Catherine is known to have been close to CD as a child, and the absence of any reference to her in the letters is best explained by her being the intended recipient. Another suggested recipient is <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3861.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">John Price</ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_994.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Browne 1995</ref>, p. 28). CD and Price were both pupils at the Royal Free Grammar School, Shrewsbury, but would have been home on holiday during the period when the letters were written. The school year comprised two terms with two seven-week holidays in June and July and December and January (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5958.xml" resp="#automat" cert="low">Oldham 1952</ref>, p. 158).</note>

            <note xml:id="foot.f4">The reference is probably to an edition of the English translation of the New Testament by George Campbell (G. Campbell trans. 1789; G. Campbell <hi rend="italic">et al.</hi> trans. 1818).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">The words ‘Note … cabinet’ are written between the first and second entries in the ‘Memorandum book’ and are separated from them by faint lines. This suggests that CD kept the memorandum book in a new box, possibly the same cabinet in which he later kept mineral samples (see <hi rend="italic">Correspondence</hi> vol. 1, <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from E. A. Darwin, 14 November 1822</ref>).</note>
