<p>I am very much obliged for the present of your book, which I have read with uncommon interest.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> It strikes me as a remarkable work, &amp; I hope it may get as wide a circulation as it deserves, for it will assuredly do much good.</p>
<p>The first, &amp; philosophical portion has struck me much. You are a bold man to speak in favour of pangenesis, and some of your observations on this subject seem to me excellent: notwithstanding the many sneers to which it has been subjected, I have faith that some such doctrine will finally prevail.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> We differ on some points, as might have been expected. I cannot, for instance digest Paget’s and your view about excretion.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> On some other points on which we differ, I am quite ready to admit that I am probably wrong; &amp; everything which you say well deserves consideration.</p>
<p>You please me greatly by the manner in which you have discussed some of my remarks, as these, as far as I know, have attracted the attention of no one else. I heartily hope that your book may be in every way successful &amp; I remain with sincere thanks | Yours very faithfully | Charles Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f2">Lowne discussed CD’s hypothesis of pangenesis (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 2: 357–404) in relation to other recent work on generation; he concluded that pangenesis was ‘extremely probable’ because of its ability to explain many phenomena of reproduction, though it was as yet ‘incapable of proof’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4904.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Lowne 1873</ref>, p. 60).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">Lowne outlined a theory that had first been presented by <ref target="../nameregs/nameregs_3643.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">James Paget</ref> regarding the growth and modification of bodily organs through nutrition and excretion (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4904.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Lowne 1873</ref>, pp. 67–76). Paget had described how many of the materials that were expelled from the blood as waste were retained by the body and used to make other parts, such as bones, hair, and horns; so that each organ of the body, while it nourished itself, was ‘in the character of an excretion towards all the rest’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6139.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. Paget 1853</ref>, 1: 33). Lowne extended Paget’s view to plants, proposing a general ‘law of correlated nutrition’ that regulated development so as to ensure ‘the survival of the race’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_4904.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Lowne 1873</ref>, p. 76). CD’s heavily annotated copy of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6139.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">J. Paget 1853</ref> is in the Darwin Library–CUL (see <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_5214.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Marginalia</hi></ref> 1: 658–61) and contains a sheet of notes headed ‘Pangenesis’.</note>
