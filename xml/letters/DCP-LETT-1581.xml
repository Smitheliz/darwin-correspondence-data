<p>I have just returned from Northamptonshire where I have been spending a week with The Revd M. J. Berkeley our Cryoptogamist, as we call him.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> I cannot say I did much work but we had many pleasant &amp; profitable Botanical chats &amp; enjoyed the sun, apricots greengages &amp; a sight of Burleigh house &amp; its pictures.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> I got a funny fact for you but I believe not a new one.<anchor xml:id="ann.a2" type="annotationEnd"/> Two varieties of Garden Peas planted side by side caused crossing &amp; the effect of the pollen of one var. produced at once a hybrid pea in the capsule of the other var.</p>
<p>Lindley tells me that the Aegilops in his garden is already identical to appearance with wheat.<ref target="#foot.f3"/> I think I told you that <anchor xml:id="ann.a3" type="annotationStart"/>I opened a dozen Meconopsis flowers at Hitcham, 10–12 days before they expanded, cut away the stigmas &amp; laid open the ovaries fully— the result was the fertilization of many ovules &amp; ripening of several seeds— this I think very fair evidence of impregnation through direct application of the pollen to the ovules,—considering that it is only a rude experiment &amp; a first one. The pollen at the time I cut away the stigmata was was not formed in the anthers, &amp; the stigmas themselves wholly unfit for impregnation. Supposing this observation to be confirmed it appears to me to diminish the value of the character afforded by Gymnosperms in both a systematic &amp; physiological point of view.<anchor xml:id="ann.a4" type="annotationEnd"/> <ref target="#foot.f4"/></p>
<p>I have been reading a capital paper at Berkeley’s on classification of vegetables, by poor Adrien de Jussieu in the Dict. Nouv. des Sc. Nat.—<ref target="#foot.f5"/> it is I suppose J<hi rend="superscript">s</hi>. last work. Brongnart has also a good paper in it on Fossil vegetables.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I spent a day at Manchester with Binney at Fossil plants,<ref target="#foot.f7"/> a study I hate &amp; despise &amp; am always sneaking after all the same. I think we have proof positive now that all Calamites <anchor xml:id="ann.a5" type="annotationStart"/>are mere casts of piths! I am glad of it for the Survey people used always to laugh at us for maintaining that we did not know that <hi rend="underline">Calamites</hi> was an identifiable vegetable form— The fact is that the striæ are the impressions of the interspaces between the medullary rays, &amp; the scars are points at which bundles go from a pseudo-medullary sheath through the woody wedges to the bark I believe they are all allied to <hi rend="underline">Lycopodiacæ</hi>, as are <hi rend="underline">Sigillariæ</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Lepidodendrons</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Anabathra</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Halonia</hi> &amp;c.<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I do not consider that these are at all allied to Phænogams though in the regular disposition<anchor xml:id="ann.a6" type="annotationEnd"/> of the vascular bundles they shew a great analogy with Exogens. They are in fact essentially Cryptogamic plants in fruitif<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. as well as in the developement of their stems &amp; their vasc. tissue; but, so far as our ideas of high &amp; low go these things are in <anchor xml:id="ann.a7" type="annotationStart"/>every respect higher than any now existing.<anchor xml:id="ann.a8" type="annotationEnd"/> I can conceive their being developed indefinitely higher still &amp; yet be no nearer Phænogams, for they would not approach the nearer to the phænogamic type. In fact I think them deadly enemies of progression; you will however I suppose allow retrocession in time as well as progression upon Zoological evidence as well as upon Botanical.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> — I forget whether I told you that they <anchor xml:id="ann.a9" type="annotationStart"/>are finding Insects<anchor xml:id="ann.a10" type="annotationEnd"/> in the Coal abundantly &amp; that some of the Neuropterides &amp; other <hi rend="underline">Ferns</hi> are insects wings!<ref target="#foot.f10"/> Lyell tells me that the Stonesfield slate marsupials are being found out to be placental &amp; other species are being added to them.<ref target="#foot.f11"/></p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a11" type="annotationStart"/>I have just read Braun upon Rejuvenescence<ref target="#foot.f12"/> &amp; am glad to hear what you think of it! I have not seen Meneghini<ref target="#foot.f13"/> either &amp; I am very sick of German phantasies, but should be glad of the loan of both these. I have been getting an insight into his essay upon what is an individual in plants,<ref target="#foot.f14"/> &amp; he has come to the conclusion that each branch or bud is an individual, for my part<anchor xml:id="ann.a12" type="annotationEnd"/> I do not see how one is to draw the line between a cell a bud &amp; a branch. <anchor xml:id="ann.a13" type="annotationStart"/>A seed I regard as an individual &amp; the only defineable individual except the cell—a seed is one &amp; indivisable; a plant is not so,<anchor xml:id="ann.a14" type="annotationEnd"/> one or many of its cells may become a new individual &amp; there is no law by which one can limit the number of cells required to carry on independent life nor mention any part of a vegetable from the leaf to the root (inclusive) that may not become or give birth to a new individual, in some one or more species.</p>
<p><anchor xml:id="ann.a15" type="annotationStart"/>Regarding your little Lennies ears<ref target="#foot.f15"/> I should think you could not do better than go to Bowman,<ref target="#foot.f16"/> who would I am sure advise you where to go supposing he thought others could give better advice than himself. he is a first rate man. I am sorry to hear such indifferent news of your brother.<ref target="#foot.f17"/></p>
<p>I shall be really glad of the <hi rend="underline">Balanidae</hi> book.—<ref target="#foot.f18"/> I have Part I. I often look at systematic Zoolog. books to see how matters &amp; subjects are treated &amp; I should have a real interest in the <hi rend="underline">Balanidae</hi> besides</p>
<p>I am doing nothing satisfactory about my future prospects—no answer yet to my memorial &amp; no prospect of one.<ref target="#foot.f19"/> meanwhile I am trying hard for a house at Kew,—one of the old uninhabited ones,—as if I cannot get one I must leave Kew in October &amp; go to Richmond or ewhere.<ref target="#foot.f20"/> My chances are small, but I am attacking the Prince now through Sir J. Clarke<anchor xml:id="ann.a16" type="annotationEnd"/> <ref target="#foot.f21"/></p>
