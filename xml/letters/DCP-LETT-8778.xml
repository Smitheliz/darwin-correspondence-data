<p>I can quite recommend Plathe and think he would do your work very well, so I will tell H<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>.<ref target="#foot.f1"/> to send his address as I have not got his new one. I know tho’ that he is near M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. Nassau Senior &amp; I believe he teaches daily at her house, so a note to her care would reach him.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> He is not my ideal master because I like a stupid well informed man to be a perfect tool in my hands when I am learn<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>. a language, but such a one would have taught me nothing under 12 and I doubt whether any untrained mind can supply <hi rend="underline">all</hi> the energy necessary to conquer a language. I mean that if I were now learning a language for the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. time I think Plathe w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. teach me better than the patient plod<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. for he who was content to unravel my difficulties in the order &amp; shape in which I put them before him &amp; from whom I learnt more in consequence than from any master I ever had. Plathe is over flowing with good nature &amp; is clever energetic &amp; often original—a great talker and keenly interested in every thing that comes before him &amp; I fancy if he had time your’s is the sort of work he would take for love. He is blessed such good health &amp; spirits that he is a most unflagging goer &amp; I fancy is the kind of man to enliven men tired with their monotonous works. I hope Richard wont over do himself, but I believe you are right to let him try the works—one must not hoard one’s valuables tho’ it is such a temptation to do it that I think you very good for resisting.<ref target="#foot.f3"/></p>
<p>I wanted to write to you but have quite exhausted myself lately in Wedgwood, Whitaker &amp; Clapham directions.<ref target="#foot.f4"/> I am so often asked for advice &amp; I never have any to give, &amp; even my opinions are a sort of inverted Descent of man &amp; I can only shew their g<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>.g<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. grandparents &amp; let other people deduct their own dogmas. If I could but keep a stock of the latter ready to hand it would save me such a lot of trouble. Whether to marry &amp; what on earth to do when you are married are subjects to drive an old maid mad when driven in a pair.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> It’s quite a relief to turn to Willie &amp; write about pigeons &amp; snipes, Scotch Collies and patent axles.<ref target="#foot.f6"/></p>
<p>I have been a good deal interested by Fawcett’s Brit<hi rend="superscript">sh</hi>. labourer.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> Have you read it? A series of lectures written 8 or 10 years back &amp; pub<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. then &amp; foretelling some of the present difficulties to a curious extent it seems to me.</p>
<p>I dont think I told you how strongly I was reminded of one of my Cannes boatmen by the bit in the expression book about shewing the teeth in anger—<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I cannot fancy a stronger instance of it; we were talking of the war &amp; I was drawing the men out &amp; rather baiting them with a careless sort of pity for the exiled Emp<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>., a dark Italian looking man got increasingly fierce &amp; scowling &amp; said it was his own fault he was an exile—why did he not return, the traitor! to answer for his deeds like a man?<ref target="#foot.f9"/> I said <formula><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>2</mn></mfrac></math></formula> mockingly still, that was the last thing I blamed him for &amp; I put it to the man what sort of a welcome he individually would give him? I declare tho’ I heard no word of his answer it frightened me out of all jesting, he drew back &amp; up the corners of his mouth till I saw every tooth in his head and to illustrate what he was say<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>. he clashed his teeth together so that my impression was he would fly at the Emp<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>.’s throat like a bulldog. I was thoroughly frightened &amp; yet so curious to know whether he really said what he acted, the whole boat was between us as he growled out the few words, that I asked him ag<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. what he would do shew<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>. I did not catch his meaning, he had been resting on his oars but then he pulled them in &amp; using his hands to express his meaning with a savage grin “je lui torderais le cou comme ça”<ref target="#foot.f10"/> giving a twist with his hands &amp; shew<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. his teeth, but not clashing them as before. Somehow that seemed more human &amp; I did not mind it so much, but the 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi>. action with the teeth was appalling &amp; I felt as if in danger from a wild beast. Even the milder edition expressed too much feeling for my taste &amp; much as I like to study character I did not go out with my friends again. I felt as if I had played with edged tools &amp; even at this time, after the lapse of a year to soften &amp; sober impressions I cannot resist the conviction that I could chaff that man into drowning me, were he &amp; I alone in a boat. I have often had to do with bad tempers &amp; rough men but had no idea before how they might frighten me. I think that unconsciously both the man &amp; I must have identified myself with the Emp<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. so that a portion of his wrath hit me as it were. So when I fancy myself tossing about in sunshine on the Med<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. or think how well it w<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. make me, it is with the light hearted brothers Lambert, etat 10 and 20, whose greatest excite<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>. was racing a steamboat &amp; their highest ambition to teach me to fish by torch light.<ref target="#foot.f11"/> I am glad y<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. boys are better<ref target="#foot.f12"/>   The Langtons are delayed here by the old man not being well but they hope to go in a few days—<ref target="#foot.f13"/></p>
