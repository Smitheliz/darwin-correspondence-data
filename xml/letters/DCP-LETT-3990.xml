<p>Thanks HBD for his lectures <hi rend="italic">On the germs and vestiges of disease</hi> [1861].</p> 
            <p>Thinks his reasoning that the V. M. F. ("force exhibited in the operations of life") is not a "given quantity" is satisfactory.</p> 
<p>How far the conditions of life affect the forms of organic life puzzles CD more than any other part of his subject. Thinks he may have underrated its importance in <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi>.</p> 
            <p>Asks for source of the quotation on regeneration in HBD’s work.</p>

<p>Absence from home &amp; consequent idleness are the causes that I have not sooner thanked you for your very kind present of your Lectures.<ref target="#foot.f2"/> Your reasoning seems quite satisfactory (though the subject is rather beyond my limit of thought &amp; knowledge) on the V.M.F. not being “a given quantity.”<ref target="#foot.f3"/> And I can see that the conditions of Life must play a most important part in allowing this quantity to increase as in the budding of a tree &amp;c.— How far these conditions act on “the <hi rend="underline">forms</hi> of organic life” (p. 46) I do not see clearly.—<ref target="#foot.f4"/> In fact no part of my subject has so completely puzzled me as to determine what effect to attribute to (what I vaguely call) the direct action of the conditions of life. I shall before long come to this subject &amp; must endeavour to come to some conclusion, when I have got the mass of collected facts in some sort of order in my mind.<ref target="#foot.f5"/> My present impression is that I have underrated this action, in the “Origin”.—<ref target="#foot.f6"/> I have no doubt when I go through your Volume, I shall find other points of interest &amp; value to me.—</p>
<p>I have already stumbled on one case, (about which I want to consult M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Paget) namely on the Regrowth of supernumerary digits.<ref target="#foot.f7"/> You refer to “White on Regeneration &amp;c. 1785.”<ref target="#foot.f8"/> I have been to Libraries of Royal &amp; Linn. Soc, &amp; to British Museum; where the Librarian got out your volume &amp; made a special hunt, &amp; can discover no trace of such a book.— Will you grant me the favour of giving me any clue, where I could see this Book? Have you it; if so &amp; <hi rend="underline">the case is given</hi> <hi rend="doubleUnderline">briefly</hi>, would you have great kindness to copy it.— I much want to know all particulars.<ref target="#foot.f9"/> One case has been given me, but with hardly minute enough details, of a supernumerary little finger which has already been <hi rend="underline">twice</hi> cut off, &amp; now the operation will soon have to be done for the third time.<ref target="#foot.f10"/></p>
<p>I am extremely much obliged for the genealogical table;<ref target="#foot.f11"/> the fact of the two cousins not, as far as yet appears, transmitting the peculiarity is extraordinary &amp; must be given by me.—<ref target="#foot.f12"/></p>
<p>With very sincere thanks for your kindness.— | Pray believe me | Dear Sir | Yours truly obliged | Ch. Darwin</p>

            <note xml:id="foot.f1">The year is established by the relationship between this letter and the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-4027.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from H. B. Dobell, 5 March 1863</ref>.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f2">The reference is to <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2068.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dobell 1861</ref>, which was sent with the <ref target="./DCP-LETT-3971.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">letter from James Paget, 7 February 1863</ref>, and is in the Darwin Library–Down.</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f3">CD refers to ‘Vitalized mode of Force’, a term coined by Dobell for ‘<hi rend="italic">the force manifested in the production, maintenance, growth, repair, and reproduction of the animal organism</hi>’ (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2068.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dobell 1861</ref>, p. 9). Dobell argued that ‘the V.M.F. may be altered in its attributes of quantity and quality by numerous causes’ (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> pp. 40–1).</note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f4">CD refers to the following passage in <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_2068.xml" resp="#mjhawkins">Dobell 1861</ref>, p. 46: <quote type="quote"> If I am right in affirming that the constitution of the animal, both in material and force, is dependent on the conditions of the external world, from which that force and material are accumulated, and if I am right in concluding that some of this force passes into the germs, and thus on into the organisms of the next generation; then the law of the <hi rend="italic">conditions of existence</hi>, insisted on by [Georges] Cuvier, becomes invested with a new dignity and importance; for not only will these conditions determine the existence of the organic being which they surround, but will carry their influence forward to the next generation, which will thus be assimilated to the conditions into which it is born. In this manner, there will be maintained a constant correlation between the forms of organic life brought into the world and the conditions on which they depend for their existence. It does not appear that Mr. Darwin has recognised the influence which may thus be exercised by the ‘conditions of life.’ If my hypothesis is correct, it will lend new importance to his theory of ‘natural selection,’ and it will supply, in part at least, an element which some of his critics have thought wanting. </quote></note>
            <note xml:id="foot.f5">CD’s assessment of the ‘Direct and definite action of the external conditions of life’ was given in chapter 23 of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> (<ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_7951.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Variation</hi></ref> 2: 271–92).

In <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref>, p. 132, CD stated: ‘How much direct effect difference of climate, food, &amp;c., produces on any being is extremely doubtful. My impression is, that the effect is extremely small in the case of animals, but perhaps rather more in that of plants.’ CD revised subsequent editions of <ref target="../bibliographies/bibl_6014.xml" resp="#mjhawkins"><hi rend="italic">Origin</hi></ref> to give more significance to the influence of external conditions (see Peckham ed. 1959, pp. 275–80).
